"It is a little misleading to say ""'Dollar Cost Averaging' is never optimal mathematically."" This is technically true, but isn't very helpful since we don't have accurate market predictions or estimates of how it will change. I haven't read the papers you're referring to, but I assume that the statement is proven asymptotically on average for a given mathematical model. But just because it isn't optimal, it doesn't mean there is another strategy that is strictly better. You say either don't buy any or spend it all now, but we don't have crystal balls so we don't really have confidence in which way the market moves.

The point of dollar cost averaging is that we sacrifice the optimal amount of profit in order to have a more advantageous cost-basis if the market moves in the opposite way that you're expecting.";1;1;False;CMMFS;dqwvt3e;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"It's basic investment advice, but it neglects to mention a few key facts, so its not that brilliant. He left out some very key details, such as the reason for BTC's valuation and why anyone shouldn't be that 'skittish' yet -

My previous post on the matter:
""As most ALT-Coins are traded back into ETH/BTC/LTC, these few coins are amongst the safest Crypto Currency holdings. You want to convert you ALT-Coins back into Fiat? The road starts with one of these 3.

The original poster neglects to mention this.
Especially BTC/ETH, they are the Key in the KeyPair relationship with all other Crytpo Currencies.""

As others have predicted, BTC will grow past the $100,000 per coin range, I suspect this will become reality for various reasons, but mainly because there is A LOT of new money coming into the market. As the rise of the ALT-Coins continues, so will the price in BTC under the current KeyPair relationship and Fiat conversion for profit taking. 

All of these factors Cement BTC/ETH's role as the KingPins of all KeyPairs, they are the Master Currencies. This will continue to be the case until the exchanges allow other Crypto's to be traded into Fiat, etc... 

Since the exchanges themselves have massive interests in BTC, LTC and ETH, don't expect this to change anytime soon.

Yes, they will have there ups and downs, but expect the upward trend as money continues to poor into the market.";1;1;False;BullShinkles;dqwvntt;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

">Buying near the ATH is very risky 

Disagree. While it is inarguable that one needs to buy low and sell high in any asset, an all-time high in real time never tells you where you are *relative to the future*. Thus, even by buying at an current ATH, you could still potentially be buying low. Look at the chart of any successful asset, by definition it made ATHs over and over.  

I am most definitely NOT saying this is the case with BTC, I am only disagreeing with the concept that on its own, buying any asset at its real-time ATH is inherently risky, any more than buying an asset at an all-time low is ""safe"". In fact, just the reverse could be true, buying an ATL could be very risky. It's the flip side of the same point.";1;1;False;sayitlikeyoumemeit;dqw1ux7;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"No, see that's the mistake people make. 

You aren't better off playing the $100,000 and buying insurance...you're better off simply playing $70,000 instead of $100,000.

The better solution to the drop in variance is to play less, not to attempt to inefficiently mitigate. 

For the BTC thing, if you thought there's 2 completely equal chances, 50% up, 50% down, you should not invest at all. 

Your investment or lack of investment is equivalent in expected return. 

If you believe it's expected return will be positive, you invest all at once. If you believe it's neutral or negative expected return, don't invest at all, or hold until a later time then invest all at once. 

There's no argument to 'average' in. 

Again, you are not 'Averaging' anything. If you buy at 15k then buy more at 10k....you simply have 2 trades. One that lost $5,000 and one that's neutral.

"Just want to point out that 'Dollar Cost Averaging' is never optimal mathematically. 

It helps people delude themselves and encourages them to chase losses. 

But if you have an asset you expect to rise buy it all at once. 

The only time to 'average in' is when you don't have a choice, in other words you can only afford to allocate $500 a month. If you have a lump sum, spend the lump sum.

There's papers on this dating back to the 60s and 70s, it's never optimal to Dollar Cost Average.

"instead of buying in one moment, you split the amount you want to invest and buy at intervals over a period of time without looking at the price.   This has the effect of ""averaging"" the price you bought at over the whole period you were buying in intervals.     So if you buy using 10% of your money each day, then after 10 days you'll have bought in at the average price over those 10 days.    This is used as a guard against unpredictable rises and falls.    It's massivley tempting to buy all in on day 1 for fear of missing out.   But believe me, almost vertical climbs are exactly what markets look like before a moment of doubt and a fall of 20-30% or more.

"This is slightly different than the blackjack scenario, but I definitely see the resemblance. In blackjack you should never take ""insurance"" because it is sub-optimal, and you should live with the outcome because in the long-run it will be better. I get that. The difference is that you get to play hundreds of hands of black jack, so the law of large numbers comes into play. However, if you are playing a single hand of blackjack for $100k, you might want to take into account the utility of the money, and take the insurance if you still need to buy your flight home.

Let's say the current price is $17000 per bitcoin. Let's say you currently have $17000 to spend. Let's say you estimate that BTC has a 50% chance to (linearly) drop to $10k over the next week and 50% chance to (linearly) rise to $20k over the next week. There are 3 options:

1. Buy all now
 
2. Buy all in a week

3. Dollar cost average over the next week.

For option 1, you immediately spend all your money and buy 1 BTC.  In the end you are guaranteed to have exactly 1 BTC, and it will be worth either $10k or $20k, for an average of $15k.

For option 2, if it goes down, you will be able to buy 1.7 BTC at $10k, or 0.85 BTC at $20k. This obviously leaves you with an average of $17k, since you bought at the end.

For option 3, if it goes down let's assume you buy in equal amounts at ever thousand. You will be left with 1.29 BTC at $10k or 0.92 BTC at $20k, leaving you with an average of ~$15.7k.


The results show that option 1 turned out to be best when it went up, option 2 turned out to be best when it went down, and option 2 was also the best on average. However, option 3 is better than option 1 on average.

The main problem in real life is that deciding between options 1 and 2 is not easy. Here option 2 turned out to be the winner, but if instead of 20k, it went to the moon, then choosing option 2 would have left you with much less BTC than options 1 or 3.  I understand that if you come up with an ensemble for what the market can do, then you can calculate the optimal strategy to maximize average profit, but this is unrealistic since I have no confidence in my ability to predict the market. Choosing option 3 allows me to have some skin in the game regardless of if the market goes the way I think it will (and it performs better if it goes against the way I think it will).";1;1;False;CMMFS;dqwy0t3;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"Fair enough, we should certainly be as civil as possible to welcome newcomers. The reason you will see hostility here with issues like the one being discussed here, is not because it's frustrating to teach people about Bitcoin, but because there is a lot of propaganda trying to redefine Bitcoin and how it works by taking advantage of people's lack of distinction in technical nuance.

For example, if Bitcoin is redefined as something that solves the double spending problem, it can be used to manipulate people into buying into centralized systems that also solve the double spending problem.

The important thing about Bitcoin is that it is uncontrolled, decentralized, and permission-less.

"From my experience with my 2 rigs for the past few months (1 with RX 580's the other with 1070's) I would say the following:

-|RX 580|GTX 1070
:--|:--|:--
Algorithm|CryptoNight|Equihash
Hashrate|780|450
Coin|Monero(XMR)|Zcash(ZEC)
Mining Software|Claymore|EWBF
Mining Pool|Nanopool|Nanopool
Daily Earnings|~$2.46|~$3.20

The only issue with mining Monero to Nanopool is that the minimum payout is 0.3 XMR (~80$) (default is 1 XMR but you can lower it!), however there is a fixed fee of 0.013 XMR (~$3.50) for every payout. So basically unless you want to pay a ~4% fee on top of the 1% pool fee, you are incentivized to increase the payout threshold (Sounds familiar to a certain company right? lol).

Though I would certainly recomend mining Zcash with Nvidia GPU's to Nanopool. The minimum payout is only 0.01 ZEC (~$3.20) with no withdrawal fees and only a 1% pool fee.

As for setting up the mining software, just follow the instructions on the Nanopool help pages:

https://xmr.nanopool.org/help

https://zec.nanopool.org/help

There are other altcoins that sometimes become more profitable than XMR and ZEC but their profitability tends to fluctuate a LOT more and you won't be able to use the larger more trustworthy pools. If you still want to get your earnings in BTC you can just open an account on an exchange and mine to those addresses and trade XMR and ZEC to BTC.";118;11;False;x10x;dqvtb98;NiceHash was hacked.

"Get a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Nano Ledger S. Once you transfer your Bitcoin (or ETH or other supported altcoin) to your hardware wallet then the security of the wallet lands entirely with you. Don't give your PW/PIN to anyone and make sure you have the backup phrase (12 or 24 words), and protect that as well. Your backup phrase translates into your 256-bit private key, which is what it all comes down to. Whoever has access to the private key has access to the coin in the wallet.

I'm not sure exactly how NiceHash works but for anyone who mines using that service, as long as they consistently transferred their earnings to a hardware wallet (or actually any other wallet in this case) their Bitcoin would have been safe.

Some people are saying they arent getting as much as they did on NiceHash, but it depends on what coin you are mining and your hardware. Also when you are mining they keep track of your money in Fiat currency like USD rather than bitcoin. Therefore if you have earned $10 and bitcoin jumps up in price you will still have $10. This isnt necessarily that huge of a problem since you can cash out in btc once you get $10, just something to be aware of. ;1;0;False;Nok-O-Lok;dqvrmbk;NiceHash was hacked.

If the private key needs to be used, then whatever is needed to ""decrypt"" it must be in plaintext on the server. Whether it's a symmetric or asymmetric key, it doesn't matter.

The server needs access to a way to decrypt it, and if malware gets on the server, it too has access to that key just the same.

Salts are for hashing, there is no hashing happening here. You'd just use different addresses (and therefore different keys for each user if you wanted).

"To clarify, it's not miners that verify. Verification is made by nodes. 

Essentially, people wishing to make a transaction broadcasts said transaction to the network. Miners then pick some transactions (at will) and put them into a block. The mining part is then guessing random values (nonce) that when hashed together with the chosen block (which also includes the hash of the previous block, thus chaining the blocks) generates a hash string with enough zeroes in the beginning. 

The amount of zeroes you need to have in a succesful hash is defined by the current difficulty level, which changes dynamically such that the average time for adding a new block is kept at 10 minutes. 

When the miner makes a succesful hash, he broadcasts it to nodes that verify it, and then it is part of the blockchain. Verification is easy, since you only need to check that hashing the chosen block with the guessed nonce actually produces the stated hash string. ";6;0;False;frevaljee;dqw1a48;NiceHash was hacked.

Bitcoin in general is like cash, not like a bank, and storing Bitcoin is a bit like keeping cash under your mattress.  If someone breaks into your house and steals your cash you have most likely lost it forever.  Yes, some would argue that storing money in a bank is safer than your mattress, and you are welcome to keep in there.

There is also nothing stopping someone from opening up a Bitcoin bank that insures deposits and acts in every way like a regular bank.  They could even give you a means to pay for things using Bitcoin from your account using a plastic card that keeps track of your balance and transfers Bitcoin to the recipient when you buy things.  They might even charge businesses a small fee to accept these types of cards, which will record the transactions off chain and give them Bitcoin later without the overhead if waiting for confirmations now.

"Again, i'm not talking about cold storage. Cold storage is a great idea, but it has nothing to do with the conversation I was having, which is:

Encrypting a key on a server does not improve security at all. Because in order for that key to be usable, the server must have access to the key that encrypted the key. So there must be a plaintext copy of a key on the server.

Cold storage is the real ""solution"" to that problem. Or more accurately segregation and keyservers is the real solution. You put all your private keys on specialized servers who's only job is to release those keys when needed to other servers that can use them, then instantly delete them from memory.

And then taken a step further, you segregate further keys into a ""cold storage"" that you need a physical person to unlock from a vault and enter by hand in order to spend larger amounts.

But all of that has nothing to do with what I was speaking to, which is that simply encrypting a key with another key doesn't improve security, and in fact it actually makes it worse as now you have 2 keys that you need to securely store, and twice the attack vector in decryption code.

">People didn't have their bitcoin wrapped up in nicehash anymore than you have your income wrapped up in your employers payroll. 

Bitcoin storage on a third party wallet is obviously not equivalent to my employer's bank account. 

>Actually, you attached a condition to that, which suggests you do think a subset of people deserved it.

The condition is that cryptocurrency is extremely vulnerable to anonymous theft if not secured properly, so one should understand this before getting into cryptocurrency. Once again, people don't 'deserve' to have their bitcoin stolen, but if they don't have the private keys, it's a reasonable expectation that they can be stolen. You remember Mt. Gox, right? 

>Nicehash was stolen from and because nicehash was robbed, they can't make good on their debts. That's not an analogous situation to storing your bitcoin with a third party.

Mt. Gox was stolen from and because Mt. Gox was robbed, they couldn't make good on their debts. Mt. Gox was 'hacked', just like Nicehash was 'hacked'. It's extremely analogous because in both situations, customer bitcoin were in the possession of a third party. Everyone who hadn't yet received payouts yet and thought they owned the amount of Bitcoin they were owed were engaging in the crypto equivalent of counting their chickens before they hatch.

>It's not a vulnerability with bitcoin.

You're right. It's not a vulnerability with Bitcoin, it's a vulnerability with third party crypto storage.

> And I fail to see how that would be the fault of the employee.

So for *this* employer/nicehash equivalency to actually make sense, we'd have to assume my employer only pays me in bitcoin that they personally hold. If I engaged in this type of payment scenario, I'd want to know what storage method they use to secure their bitcoin. If they said ""Well, our private keys are stored on a server connected to the internet and we'll only pay you once you hit certain targets."" I would immediately realize that by working for them, there's a real risk that they won't have bitcoin to pay me with at some point because it was all stolen by a hacker.

Holy shit you're crazy! It's probably a good thing I won't get any more replies to you...

And how the hell would anything I say protect my own assets? Like jesus christ...

It's kind of funny actually, you are right, but you are arguing with nobody. I'm not saying you are wrong about anything you have said, and I actually agreed with you in every comment, but I'm pointing out that you are bringing up all of this for no reason. It has nothing to do with my first comment, which is that in order to have a private key that can be used to sign transactions, it MUST be in plaintext at some point. And if it's encrypted, it doesn't help anything, because the key to that encryption must then be in plaintext on the server in order for it to be used.

I didn't talk about cold storage, I didn't talk about keyservers, I didn't talk about if they were right or wrong about the way they setup their services, I just said that ""why didn't they encrypt the key"" is a dumb sentence, and that simply ""encrypting the key"" wouldn't help...

"> Cold storage is a great idea, but it has nothing to do with

It has everything to do with it. For example, taken from another comment to this post: coinbase, a completely shitty example that nobody should be using as an exemplar, but unfortunately here we are and they are among the best we have to work with. They keep 2% in the hot wallet and that money is insured. What happened with nicehash and many other bitcoin companies who got ""hacked"" because their private keys werent firewalled properly (something you leave out of your description, but which is still irrelevant given that cold storage will protect you), couldnt even possibly happen to them. 

At most they lose the 2% from the hot wallet, nobody with money tied up in their online wallet gets hurt because it is insured, and there are some honestly sad stories to read here as there are every time this happens, and the persons with access to the hot wallet are suspects under investigation for theft.

>So there must be a plaintext copy of a key on the server.

This is WRONG. The key can be firewalled on a system not accessible from the internet where the transaction gets signed and then handed over to an online system to make the actual transaction. You're wasting your time sweeping the truth under the rug for thieves, the people who ran nicehash are THIEVES, NOT victims.

"Here is a quote from [here](http://99bitcoins.com/know-how-bitcoin-works/amp) that does a pretty good job explaining:


> Bitcoins come into existence through a process called mining. Mining is the competitive use of computational power to calculate a number that falls within a certain range. The valid number range is periodically adjusted by the Bitcoin network to make it more or less difficult to find the solution; the target rate is 1 solution every 10 minutes.

Private key is 256 bits long, that is 1.15e77 possible keys.

To break that with every hash on the network dedicated to trying where one attempt was equivalent to a hash at the current rate of 15e9 TH/s would take 1.9*10\^48 times the age of the universe, to guarantee a solution.

"Note that GTX 1070 also costs roughly double to buy compared to RX 580, and RX 580 is essentially last gen compared to GTX 1070.

RX580 you can pick up for 200‚Ç¨ (240$) and 1070 for 390‚Ç¨ (470$), power consumption is about the same. Even if we use inflated price for RX580 of roughly 250‚Ç¨ (300$) breakeven periods are: 122days for RX580 and 147days using your values.

However your revenue per day numbers are incorrect, they are currnetly 2.12 and 2.54$ respectively, which yields 142 days and 185 days for breakeven respectively. Again using RX580 inflated pricing.

If we take Vega 56 in comparison which is highly more efficient and costs roughly the same at ~490$ it hashes 1900h/s on monero at almost same power consumption of around 130W per GPU we get some magic numbers: 5.17$ per day return and 95 days breakeven.

Also heavily dependant on tuning what power consumption and hash rate you get.

I don't understand this fetish with Nvidia GPUs for mining. AMD has always been the top dog here, no doubt about it, infact, quite on different level. Even CPU mining with AMD Ryzen is profitable at this moment, a Ryzen 3 1200 can do 300-320h/s, and Ryzen 7 1700 620, which yields 0.87$ and 1.69$ respectively each day at costs of 100$ and 290$ respectively, with breakevens of 115 days and 172 days respectively. Power consumption is on level with RX580.

"When I first started mining, it was just with my 1070. Up until now I've been using nicehash because of their automatic mining algorithm. Being deposited to coinbase (highly recommend).

Use MSI afterburner to find the sweet spot for overclocking your card, I have mine set to +150 core clock, +500 memory clock. I could easily push higher without fail, I'm just to find the sweet spot for my card and have 0 issues with that overclock. 

After that, start up your miner, benchmark and you're all set to go! 

If this is your main PC like me, don't forget to save settings on afterburner and restore it whenever you're ready to play. The overclock works fine for low usage games like league, but for CSGO or some AAA games you will experience tearing.

I mainly used to mine overnight, as electricity rates are cheaper then. Check your local rates and see what it's worth. I'm in Ontario so I googled Ontario electricity rates and the government website came up. I get charged 13.2 cents per Kw on peak(most expensive) and used that to fill nicehashs profitability calculator. Even during the most expensive time I was making a profit, so I went for it almost 24/7 except when I'm gaming. (My PC is always on anyways because my plex and team speak server so it wasn't a hard choice for me)

"No problem man, i'm happy to help! I personally haven't mined using ASIC's like Antminer but i've done some research on the basics.

From what I could find they seem to be quite profitable and can get you your return on investment within a few months which is typically faster than mining altcoins with GPU's. **HOWEVER**, there are 3 main problems I found with it:

1) Antminers are basically impossible to purchase at retail price without waiting months to get them on a preorder. They end up being sold at 4-5 times their price on places like Ebay and at that price make your actual ROI well over a year. So why not just go through with the pre-order at the retail price? The thing with mining is that the difficulty can increase drastically within the space of just a month and by the time you receive it, the difficulty of mining bitcoin with that ASIC may mean it's no longer profitable. Besides, if it is still profitable it would make more sense to just sell it on Ebay and quadruple your investment instantly. Antminer may have also released a new, more powerful miner which further increases the difficulty due to all the extra hashing power in the system. With GPU mining, if the difficulty of mining 1 coin goes up you can always just start mining a different coin.

2) They are extremely loud. Like between 80 dBA (hairdryer) and 90dBA (lawn mower) loud. Most people keep GPU mining rigs on 24/7 in their houses and I know I sure as hell won't be able to sleep with a lawn mower on inside my house.

3) They have no value outside of their sole purpose of mining Bitcoin. With GPU's miners always have the fallback of being able to sell their hardware to people looking to use it for gaming. With Antminer however, they tend to become pretty worthless once they get a few generations old, so you better hope you've mined enough Bitcoin to recover the initial purchase price.

Do bear in mind though that all of the above is just my opinion formed from the research I did when I too was interested in mining Bitcoin. When I started mining alt-coins many people were saying then was not a good time to start but I did anyway and it has turned out to be quite lucrative so don't let me tell you it's not worth it, just make sure you do your own research.

I just, LAST NIGHT, decided I would try and see what the feasibility of mining would be, since I have a 1080 GPU. I researched a bit, checked here on Reddit and some other places and determined that NiceHash was legit enough to give it a whirl for a day or two and see what kind of throughput I could get. I started the mining at about 1:30 AM, saw maybe 10 cents of mining activity kick in and thought, hey cool, I'll see how this goes. Went to bed, wake up 6 hours later...no GPU whirring...try to log in...CAN'T LOG IN! I started to freak out thinking they hacked me the moment I locked my screen or something...had to go to work, so just shut the system down and tried not to think about it all day. Fast forward to this evening...turn on my PC, log in without any issue...must have been me mistyping in the dark too many times for the trouble in the morning. My system comes up, my browser windows restore to their last pages and I see the NiceHash workers status page up with the news of their breach. WOW!!!! What a wild situation. I'm not 100% comfy with what the status of my own system might be after an event like this. For the moment I've changed passwords and monitored for any strange activity, and so far seem to be clean. Over the next couple of days I'm going to rebuild my PC just to make sure. I try to do it once a year just to keep things cleaned up and high performance, so this kind of forces me to do it. I know that getting into Bitcoin is like being on a rollercoaster, but didn't know that my very first attempt at some kind of mining was going to be even more intense.

"Nicehash isn't bitcoin mining - it's altcoin mining. Why would the downfall of an altcoin mining company matter much to bitcoin in the long run? The reason this affects the bitcoin community is that Nicehash paid people in bitcoin. All things considered, however, they were small fish. Exchanges have been constantly hacked throughout bitcoin's history, and many of those incidents are barely remembered. So why would nicehash deserve our undue attention, when it's barely even related to bitcoin at all?

I agree with your sentiment that this sub has taken a plunge. But there's little we can do about it. This is a symptom of what I have seen occur IRL over the last few weeks. The average joe speculators are now in on bitcoin, and they are buying with the intent of selling at a higher price never having learned how bitcoin works or what it can do beyond serving as a speculative investment.

Altcoins shills are taking advantage of the situation, as well, calling this the downfall of bitcoin as a currency.

You're also expecting me to believe you had zero safeguards against 61 million dollars transferring to one single address, and then you claim you're running maintenance on the site. You also push more people to using your online wallet by offering discounts on transaction fees. How fucking retarded do you think people are? This is either plainly criminal, or plainly incompetent.

Can someone ELI5 how they could've keep the money safe if they hold it in ""physical"" form?

They way I understand this is that you have multiple bitcoin addresses because the only security you have is the address itself. So you have a main address which holds your coins, a secondary address to which you send coins you want to trade with and after a trade you take the leftover coins from your secondary account back to your main one.

But how can it be safe if the address itself isn't secured with some kind of password?

"Going by memory here, haven't used Nicehash since last year:

Nicehash is, for lack of a better explanation, a mining pool.  It does not pay out instantaneously, you have to reach certain reasonable minimums (I was able to hit 2x the minimum when I tried off and on for 4 days on a GTX 1080, shits and giggles) that are then paid out every week.  There's a smaller minimum that pays out once a month so that people mining with a piece of bread can get in on the action.

If you specify a wallet address, it gets sent there on time, every time.

This attack probably hit earlier today or late yesterday.  If I recall, they pay out on Friday.  The wallet that got grabbed was probably the nicehash pool for this week, more or less, with a ton of leftover satoshis that have been waiting in hell on a million abandoned accounts.  And whatever the Nicehash ""take"" was.

Ouch.  But for the individual miners, this probably isn't a mtgox level event.  Point being, this isn't exactly a ""people left their coins on a website zomg!!!"" type of thing.  It's more a ""damn most of this week's electricity went to waste!"" for most people in Nicehash, I'd bet.";8;2;False;EndTimer;dqvmdm4;NiceHash was hacked.

Cryptocurrency tumbler or cryptocurrency mixing service is a service offered to mix potentially identifiable or 'tainted' cryptocurrency funds with others, with the intention of confusing the trail back to the fund's original source. Tumblers have arisen to improve the anonymity of popular cryptocurrencies, usually bitcoin (Bitcoin mixer), since they provide a public ledger of all transactions.

That's true but for a user of the service, even if they pointed their miner to an external wallet, it would mine to a Nicehash wallet until it reached a certain point where it would payout. I'm not sure but I think other mining pools work the same way. You mine to the pool, you reach a threshold, and then they payout. If you were making a lot, you could potentially get paid everyday, but smaller miners such as myself had to wait weeks or months. Fortunately for those who cashed out as soon as possible, they didn't loose much. The ones who lost the most are the ones who didn't heed your advice and kept their funds in Nicehash. For me, personally, I lost about $100 but I knew that it wasn't actually mine until it payed out, so I never counted it toward my overall BTC balance and I can just shrug it off. It just sucks that I left my computer running all that time and wasted processing power and electricity for nothing.;2;1;False;Chiyo;dqvqegc;NiceHash was hacked.

"It depends on what GPU you're running.

Older models aren't efficient enough. However if you happen to run a GTX1070 or equivalent it's still ""profitable"" in the sense that the GPU mines more than it consumes in electricity. 

The ROI still isn't stellar considering current state of things, but if you consider the projected profits from simply hodling the mined BTC it is very well possible that those few bucks mined today will be worth a few thousand down the line.
That's what many GPU miners are banking on, and it makes sense IMO.

That is... until Nicehash gets hacked and you lose everything...

A lot of it is legacy code. US banks started digitizing in the 1960s, and there are still legacy systems that old. [Here's an article about it](https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/replace-those-aging-core-systems-now).

Another factor is that the US has something like 6,900 active banks, so major changes need a lot of coordination and can take many years to execute. That's a bit more than the entire Euro area (~5,689). From what I can tell, Australia has less than a tenth of that number of banks.

We've been overdue for a price correction for a while now. The risk is that it comes after the futures open. A massive price correction immediately or soon after the futures get offered could set a trend of shorting Bitcoin as being a reasonable bet, especially since many in Wall Street are still convinced that this is just a bubble waiting to burst. On the other hand, a price correction followed by continuous upward growth would be a great thing for us, since shorters would sweat pretty quickly and those who expect Bitcoin to do will would become more prominent in investment communities.;24;2;False;greyhoundfd;dqvywig;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201

Coinbase. Download on a safe device. No porn! Set up bank account or credit card and identification. It maybe takes 15 minutes at most. You will need your ID to take a picture of it.

"I'm not saying that the US dollar is great either--fiat currency seems like a bad idea in general, and I dislike the Fed as much as the next guy.

That being said, the US dollar is undoubtedly more stable than bitcoin, both short and long run.  Sure, the petrodollar presents a significant vulnerability, but what other alternatives are there at present?  The US dollar will almost surely remain dominant for the foreseeable future, as changing the primary international reserve currency to the Euro or RMB or Rouble brings with it far more political and economic instability than the US dollar.  The EU, China, and Russia, respectively, are much more unstable both economically and politically.  

I do think there will be a transition to more cryptocurrencies or, generally speaking, significant reforms to the international monetary system.  However it doesn't look like it is right around the corner, and the insane growth in bitcoin right now likely highlights the problems with cryptocurrencies, rather than showing that this is the future.";2;0;False;RevolutionaryNews;dqwlg6j;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201

tldr a futures contract is an agreement to buy a commodity at a set price at a set date in the future. The key is you do not have to own the commodity in order to sell a futures contract, meaning you can sell something you don't own, thus 'shorting' the commodity so that you make money if the price falls (since you buy the commodity at the lower price to complete the contract when it expires).

Once you‚Äôve got that figured out, then you can move on to the bigger things and open up an account on Bittrex.

the Best method if you are serious about putting money in and not withdrawing is to buy with your own order on GDAX and then when the money is available switch it to a hardware wallet offline (Trezor/Exodus/Ledger). that way it is safe and not sitting on an exchange for longer than necessary. put in weekly amounts with whatever you are comfortable with for as long as you are comfortable with. then hold no matter what happens. the second you invest try to develop a mindset where you think you will never see that money again in your life...any profit after that will seem as a surprise. ;2;0;False;daniellllllllllllll;dqwu6w8;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201
"Okay but every conservative, traditional investor will tell you that. Also have to remember that most of them have reasons to denounce bitcoin. Mostly for personal gains. 

1. Their capital is solely in usd. They have to be at least a little worried of bitcoin. Considering it‚Äôs dominating usd value.

2. They analyze from a traditional investors perspective. Y‚Äôall have to understand we are pioneering this market. This is new and unprecedented. Except apparently by some flowers.. In the 1600s... When capitalism was just being birthed. 

3. Touching on what was stated above; they analyze from a traditional investors perspective. Most of them are probably old fashioned , stick to bonds, etfs, mutual funds ( which they shouldn‚Äôt) while it‚Äôs safe it‚Äôs not like the stock market doesn‚Äôt see 69% crashes. Not to mention we‚Äôre long overdue for a bear market.

4. We‚Äôre going to da moon üåö 


Also I feel that whenever big name investors or billionaire super stars speak against bitcoin, not all, but some definitely have personal gains they‚Äôre seeking by spreading FUD. they know bitcoin is a problem. That‚Äôs why any article you read about investing in bitcoin will say don‚Äôt do it. But why listen to the ruling upper class ? You think you‚Äôre in their best interest ? You think they haven‚Äôt stored away thousands of bitcoin ? Keep dreaming . The world works like clockwork and every message is portrayed to illicit a specific response. It‚Äôs how you decide to respond that matters. 

Edit: I listened to the institutional perspective on bitcoin for years. Been following since 2012 at $80. Of course people thought it was a joke. Only something to buy illegal drugs on Silk Road with. Then I fell into some cash in 2014 and checked bitcoin again as an investment. It‚Äôs an echo chamber. Everyone tied to a massive corporation or bank will advise against it. Fast forward another few years 2017 I checked again. It broke $1000. Surely I looked into investing , again. And found the same advice again. But this time I decided to do more extensive research. What I found along with my old reactions of ‚ÄúInternet money?? What‚Äôs the value in that??‚Äù Was the spark to get in. I had had the wrong reaction every time, and I still thought it was crazy over priced. But I decided I was wrong every other time, might as well take the chance. Here I am a year later and probably worth double what I was at the beginning of the year. I love crypto not just because of money but I want as loose of government ties as possible. Crypto is a huge step toward taking matters in to our own hands.

"Yeah, I have a hard time reading the sentiment in the crypto space right now.  Many people outside it are confident it's a bubble and are thus very bearish but unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.  Many longs are saying it has run too far too fast, and are either taking profits or buckling up for some volatility.  I don't see too many people expecting prices to go much higher in the short term (although it's hard to rule it out as a possibility, based on the recent past), so even given the run up I don't think sentiment is excessively positive.

I don't know where it's headed from here.  My base case is a 'sell the news' pullback early next week after futures are released.  But I don't really expect significant or sustained downside (I consider touching 10K insignificant).  The uptrend has been driven by sharply rising adoption and the beginning of institutional interest.  Those factors will not disappear overnight even in a sell-off, and I'm still surrounded by people who want to put more money into BTC but are constrained by deposit limits or other barriers.

We've seen sharp pullbacks and sharp recoveries.  The availability of shorting could make those recoveries even sharper and more panic-fueled.

In summary, I don't think the price is an obvious long or short in the short term.  I expect volatility in both directions.  But I wouldn't count out the long side.  It's rare that a rally dies just at the moment that institutions start taking an asset more seriously, and gain greater access to it.  Usually the big top occurs after institutions have sold to the 'dumb money', and I think that doesn't happen until an ETF is released.

But we shall see.  To borrow your words: ""I could be wrong of course"".";1;0;False;arBettor;dqx0vqu;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201

The price taking a 25% drop is good for us hodlers who want to buy cheap, but the more people jumping on with a week hand the bigger the drop will be and the more volatile bitcoin will become. new actual investors will be scared away and will be replaced with day trading gamblers.

But,

The profit scales with how much you spend everyday. For the first month I got in, I set $7 everday. Problem is, I've set a goal to get a certain amount of Bitcoin, and with its price constantly going up, it gets harder and harder to get there and by the time that I do, I'd probably have spent 3 times the money as compared to if I had dumped the total sum accumulated from the increment into just one big purchase.

If you have the security and confidence to spend a somewhat large amount of money all at once, then by all means do so. 

I did it, and honestly I feel much better especially when all I have to do now is sit back and watch the price go up and not having to anxiously wait for a drop and rush to buy.";1;2;False;izzulaizad95;dqwcbbx;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201

I think we‚Äôll see a dip by late January/early February. It‚Äôs such a hot topic right now and so many new people are buying fueled by media interest. Besides all the usual suspects coming around we‚Äôre likely seeing millions of people‚Äôs parents, etc that all wanted to get in and had there kids show them how it works around Thanksgiving. With the price even higher and the media story even bigger i bet that will be magnified around Christmas and then it will take them 2-3 weeks to enter the market. After that I‚Äôd have to think we‚Äôll start to run out of some gas in the short term but then again who knows. There are still so few people who own any BTC that it could go on a long time, i just worry about the Trump administration meddling when it‚Äôs so in the news. ;1;0;False;bobvila2;dqwcg6a;$1000 dollar checkpoints be like;7i2dyd;https://v.redd.it/qhhxidus5e201

"Firstly, thanks for the depth to your response, I love it!!

I never said media has our best interests in mind, I'm well aware of who owns the media. Most of the media analysis I've seen of bitcoin isn't positive! That's why it doesn't scare me as much, because the media is trying to scare the public and its not working. It's backfiring. I've had more people ask me about bitcoin in the last month than ever before. And they have no idea what it really is, they come in thinking it's a bubble that's past it's time to burst and saying it's not even a blip in the financial world and leave with me sending them tons of links tp read and videos to watch. I can only minimally explain things so I shift where there looking to places that actually understand bitcoin.

I think you meant btc market cap is 250 billion(edit: i just saw the decimal, .25T, my bad). My prediction is based on looking at previous growth rates vs the current one and we're just reaching the end of the gradual raise up to the spike up. Also I'm someone who thinks Metcalfe's law applies to bitcoin, since bitcoin is as much it's network as it is the currency, the value of the network is proportional to the number of connected users. 

I never said I have the capital to fight wall street, but the community and new adopters as a whole could slow them down. But I largely agree with your last 2 paragraphs, but I'm still torn and hold hope that we as a community can fight back. I do think there will be a large correction/dip but I don't think it happens til btc hits 100k+. And I do accept the very real possibility wall street does everything you say and you are right.

Put in a sell order for 100 bitcoins and create a wall. As price creeps closer to that wall have a group member place a buy order for 110 bitcoins slightly above the market price at the wall price. You now buy and sell to the persons in your group. Not that hard to manipulate in that way. They gain by causing a price hike which they will eventually sell and then bet the future. This causes a double dip (sell at the height and cash in on the crash).;2;0;False;BJJJourney;dqwq2pt;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/
Why are you labeling as FUD a valid concern? Look, I 'm not a tech expert to tell you exactly how to do this in GDAX, but since this happens ALL THE TIME in regulated markets, it is more than likely that it can happen in bitcoin. Do you honestly think that hedge fund managers who bet billions and do this for a living would have a hard time colluding with exchanges? Or play dirty tricks? This exponential rise is not in favor of bitcoin anymore. BTC has to prove its resilience, and this needs time in the market. Exponential increase attracts people who want quick cash and will panic in a heart beat. EDIT: to address your fee concern, it is really nothing to pay 0.1% in each transaction if your bet will give you 1000% at futures.;9;2;False;grouper13;dqwd5gm;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/
"Why would I roll my futures contract forward if I'm significantly in the money and I believe there's a risk to my position in the next period? 

No one actually has any positions in BTC with these futures, it will be some sort of contract where for every $1 or so movement, the contract will pay a 10, 20, 30x multiplier to the party who's in the money. 

What is crucial is to see when the futures go live, what the price is. If the price is instantly lower than the current market price - then we have a problem.

"You seem to know what you're talking about, and I agree with you that the ""scalping"" thing is unlikely.

As someone who is knowledgeable about markets, can you help explain why the following scenario is likely/unlikely/plausible?

1. Traders buy huge amounts of BTC before the CME futures open, pushing the price up (maybe happening now?).
2. Traders short BTC in cash when the CME futures open.
3. The same traders market sell their newly accumulated BTC, causing a crash in BTC price (and gaining huge amounts of cash due to their short positions).
4. Traders close their short positions, reaping the cash profits (along with the profit they may have made on their initial BTC purchases)
5. [optional] Traders rebuy BTC at low rates and attempt to capitalize on ""buying the dip"".

If this is possible, then I think we could be in for a wild ride.

Market makers don't live on the hodl, they live on the bid/ask spread, and since they usually have a long position so they can always post an ask, they last thing they want to do is crash the market.

"No. It is based on nothing, ""nothing"" being the mirror image of the bitcoin market. 
It is a mirror market at CME, the are NOT going to directly buy assets of bitcoin. They are not going to touch bitcoin except maybe transaction fees or limiting the market to where they can buy on behalf of others as an agency of bitcoin. CME will bet on a mirror market with marginal changes up or down of the future movements of bitcoin. That is why they call it ""futures market"". Watching and betting on the rise or fall of one market unrelated to the actual market. It is like betting on horse races without buying the horse. They call it a ""future"" but in reality it is a gamble on the future without effect to bitcoin raising or falling except to loose or win their marginal change bets. 

However, the more media they push to sell their futures, the higher bitcoin will rise. They will pay for media attention unlike bitcoin users have not. If a large bet is placed on the changes in the market, they may use the media to cause a short term frenzy to fluctuate the market, however, it will still grow at the upward trend even with their interrupting manipulations. That is why they are acting as an agent for those who want to buy through bitfinex, they intend to profit off the transaction fees when the market fluctuates while also profiting on marginal bets of the future in the future exchange they create.

Eventually if bitcoin spreads as a currency, the Fed will need to buy bitcoin (or bank vault wallets) to preserve the fractional reserve banking system in the U.S. however, we are not even close to that yet.

"A bubble doesn't describe necessarily something that is run by Wall street. A bubble is an unstable rise of value. Value that becomes so high that eventually it reaches a point where the ones holding the property in question can't afford to keep it. 

I'll give you an example. 

Say I have a house and I bought it for 100,000. Very few people have 100,000 just sitting somewhere. So I, like most people, will get a loan. Say after 10 years I've paid off 30,000. I still owe 70,000 on the loan. If I sell it at the price I paid, I will make 30,000 (For the sake of clarity I'm not counting all the fees and paperwork costs that go into selling a house). The guy that gets it now owes 100,000 just like I did 10 years ago. 

Now say that instead of selling the house at 100k, I sell it at 110k. The next guy may take it without thinking anything of it if he sees all the houses near it are also worth around the same price. He'll buy. 

Now enter speculation (like with bitcoin). Say I live in a neighborhood that is rumored to be up and coming. Sure there's a new cookie shop in the corner but it used to be a jail bond office. So people are excited. They think the neighborhood is turning. So instead of selling my house at 110k and making 40k back on my initial 100k investment, I'm going to sell it at 200k. Is the house worth 200k? Probably not, but if the rumor is persistent, the rich will think that this neighborhood is headed to the 600, 700s. Buying the property now is going to seem like a steal in the future when I can sell the house at 700k. 

The problem is that poor people that can't afford these prices and the taxes that come with the house are also trying to get in on the action. So someone that can't afford a 200k house will get it and the bank will give him the loan because they also heard the rumor of the up and coming neighborhood. So here's a guy struggling to keep up with the loan payments and the taxes on a 200k house barely making it. Eventually he gets tired of the struggle and sells the house at 300k and some other poor schmuck gets in on it thinking that he's going to last the time until the land is worth what he wants to cash out at. Basically they're all playing hot potato and if the neighborhood ends up not fulfilling the promise it seems to show before all of the people struggling to keep up with payments give out, the inflated price of the houses crashes because they all go into foreclosure at roughly around the same time (when the bubble collapses). The reason for it being called a bubble is because it is flimsy and there's no real reason why a 70k house should be sold for 700k. The bank will end up with all these shitty houses and in order to start making money on them again, will have to take a loss in the short term if it wants to get it's money back in the long term. 

How does this apply to bitcoin? Bitcoin is becoming accepted more and more. A lot of places are starting to take it. The promise of bitcoin is that one day, it will be internationally recognized as valid currency. And although it hasn't come to that yet, it seems to be getting there. 

However, we're still far from that. The fact that it's rising in price is troubling. It's EXTREMELY likely that someone is inflating the price on purpose with the objective of crashing it. If someone is buying up all of the bitcoin, that one person will have the power to sell it all in one go and crash the bitcoin market. 

Crashing the bitcoin market doesn't make sense if you own all of the bitcoin until you realize that it's possible to bet against bitcoin. There are a lot of powerful people who don't give a shit about bitcoin. All they care about is money. If they bet against bitcoin, it's in their best interest to buy bitcoin, depress the market in order to artificially inflate prices, and sell all at once *if* they have bet against bitcoin. The best defense against this when it happens to fiat money is to cut the value in half and multiply everyone's bitcoins into two, just like what happens to stocks when they become too valuable. 

Of course, I'm only basing that on history. Who knows. Maybe this is the first time in the history of humankind that a price inflates so fast without any repercussions of any kind.";5;0;False;cashmeowsighhabadah;dqwrwld;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"Traders can manipulate small caps and issues w/ low trading volumes.  Traders can't manipulate large market cap issues w/ significant trading volume.

Further your implication is that the billioniares are scalping each other, which is also pretty far disconnected from reality.

And when they take profits, its not ""short selling"", it's closing a long position.  And BTC futures will be cash settled, so no need to sell off positions just before expiry to avoid taking physical delivery. edit: Just let them expire and settle to cash. And they've already been settled to cash daily as part of the clearing cycle in the 45 min window when trading is closed.

And usually futures traders don't close positions before expiry, they ""roll forward"" the contracts (sell near month, buy far month) which is why you end up with contango loss if you use futures to simulate a long position in the physical.

Really, you *appear* to have no understanding of the actual mechanics of how the markets work, and are basing your entire understanding on ""Trading Places"", a movie that was made 30 years ago, dealt with inside information about unreleased crop reports, and was farcical even then.

Yes, when everyone sells at once and nobody is buying, you get a crash.  But that is not a billionaire taking advantage of the market.  The traders/billionaires are usually smart enough to sell into demand while it's still rising.

This is true. I guess the question is whether we're close to the point of not seeing high returns. If new fomo buyers are largely responsible for the recent upsurge, that would devolve into a question about whether we're nearing the point of exhausting that pool.

A wise decision that you might really come to regret. Bitcoin is in a class of its own. I don't think that the cat can be put back in the bag.

"Shorting means borrowing shares, selling them, And buying back lower. You are betting the price will go lower, and will make money on the way down. You don't always have to do it on margin.

Imagine you had 10 btc at $10k, now it's $15k, and you think it's going down. You sell your 10 btc for $150k, and use that as collateral to borrow another 10 btc, or on margin, you could borrow 100 btc. And sell those. Now you have another $150k, or maybe $1.5m, and to close the position, if BTC goes back down to $10, it will only cost you $100k or $1m to buy back the 10 btc or 100 btc and close your position with the person you borrowed from.

It really is weird that the value has risen so much this year and for no real good reason. As you pointed out, no-one *uses* bitcoin, and at the start of the year no-one knew whether bitcoin would go anywhere at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the bitcoin market is being artificially inflated. The currency is not used. It's not intrinsically worth anything. It's sketchy.

The 2013 crash *should've'* been the great depression-style event of the 21st century, if it weren't for the ridiculous government intervention+non-stop printing of extra fiat cash that was done by the US/federal reserve, IMF etc. which has only prolonged the problems that caused it, they'll inevitably creep back up again.

"> 35% is pretty hefty margin in such a volatile market (even though forex margins can be far higher, but obviously with far less volatility).

35% is very high for the futures markets... but considering BTC can trade that range in a single day, it's maybe not high enough!!!

35% margin, it means you will have to have 5 x 15,000 x 35% = $26,250 in your account to buy one CME contract @ 15,000.  Or $5,250 to buy one CBOE contract.  And you'll need to send in more if BTC goes down in order to maintain the 35% margin requirement.

By comparison, you can buy eMini contracts w/ $4,500.  An emini is 50 units of the SPX (@ ~2635), or roughly $131,000 exposure.  IOW, spx contracts are margined at roughly 3.5%.

"Well there's no telling when the crash will be, how high it will go before and where it will crash to. And it's a little concerning hearing the ""win"" used in this sense because it fuels the speculative nature of bitcoin. 

Bitcoin shouldn't be thought of as something to make you more rich. The entire purpose of bitcoin is to exit the current manipulated fiat system. I don't think of it as ""winning"" per say more than simply having choice available. 

However, as a disclaimer I have taken a fair amount off the table as a hedge and have it available to buy during when I expect there to be a crash. I can tell you 20-50% per day is not sustainable. There's a crash coming. When and how much is anyone's guess. I think it will be quite stark after futures markets open.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a stock, it‚Äôs a currency. You go to the right exchange, and you can trade your bitcoin for whatever currency you need.

"> In this scenario, wouldn't the shorter have the ability to manipulate the market in his favour, by market selling the BTC on an exchange and then closing his short position in cash when the BTC price falls as a result of his market sell? Possibly even a cascade effect of multiple shorters doing the same thing (using software bots/algorithms, or by collusion)?

In theory yes.  But in practice you have trading costs and spreads.  The more volatile the underlying and less efficient the hedge, the greater the spreads.  I expect to see large spreads in the futures market during periods of volatility,and even larger spreads on any options on futures that may be traded.

Plus, market orders are taker orders both on GDAX for example w/ taker fees, and also on the CME w/ spreads.  And per contract fees.   So a seemingly clean arb turns into a ""maybe I beat the costs maybe I don't"" scenario pretty quick.

It's not that they were ever *useless*, it was that they couldn't monetize. And all it takes to trade stock is a bank account. For bitcoin, its crux will be lack of actual utilization. Both the internet and bitcoin are world shattering...blockchain will be the next big tech revolution our generation goes through (along with AI), just like the internet. The issue with the web was that all these sites were getting millions of visitors. People knew this was big but they didn't understand it and dumped money in with no clue of the value. The exact same thing is going on with crypto. We know it's big but we still don't fully understand its implications (or catalysts)...it will bomb hard. Like absolutely bomb once average joes start consolidating and once it's opened to short interest.

"Actually you do borrow shares, through your broker, who then has to go out to a security lending network.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_lending

The reason this works is because any security held in a margin account *requires* you hypothecate it back out for lending.

In a short squeeze, a classic way punish the shorts is (was?) to transfer your shares to a cash account (non marginable, non hypothecated), which would revoke them from any lending that maybe in effect.

IRA's and 401k's are cash accounts. No margin. I'm not sure about mutual funds, but I think the shares they hold are also not available for shorting. Therefore, some percentage of shares are held not shortable.  By revoking the shorts, you are forcing them to cover, driving the price even higher.  Then you can sell your long position from your cash account, hopefully punlishing them for shorting against you.

If you're warren buffet.  Joe the plumber just maybe sees his ""pipe valve supply"" micro cap go screaming up and then back down. Or maybe he doesn't.

"I think I get it, I guess the problem I'm trying to get my head around is if one party (lets say the shorter) already has the ability to cause a crash because they already own BTC, that they have been buying in this rally. And the other party (going long), has no BTC hedge.

In this scenario, wouldn't the shorter have the ability to manipulate the market in his favour, by market selling the BTC on an exchange and then closing his short position in cash when the BTC price falls as a result of his market sell? Possibly even a cascade effect of multiple shorters doing the same thing (using software bots/algorithms, or by collusion)?

And if it's a margin short, wouldn't this give an advantage to the short seller (assuming they had stocked up on BTC beforehand, to sell and drop the BTC price)?

But the risk is certainly there - there might not be enough people shorting/manipulating to make the price drop far enough, essentially liquidating all the short positions and sending the BTC price even higher, right?";1;1;False;majestic_12inch;dqwzz6u;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"incl my profits it would be at 40% right now.

That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind this 20% equals about 1 month and a half of salary (on my current job)

I saved about 10k, invested 2k into bitcoin and planning to cash out the 2k when it hits 16k and my investment is basicly doubled at that point.

with the recent spikes in BTC i didn't want to miss out, i have a chance to generate well over 10k of profits this way (3/4 year investment) and only lose about a month worth of salary in the worst case scenario when btc would reach 0$. 

Keep in mind that as my savings increase the % of my investments will slowly go down. 

2k on 10k = 20%
2k on 20k = 10% 

I expect to have about 30-40k of savings in 3/4 years excluding my investments right now, wich is why i decided to take a bigger risk and invest more into crypto right now.";1;0;False;Alpropos;dqwkwwm;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"You were good right up until your last sentence. The current high fees are not caused by a shortage of miners or nodes, but a glut of demand. To get into the next block you need to compete with all the transactions in the mempool over fees. Right now you need to pay around 300 Sat/B. That's quite a lot, but if you use a SegWit transaction you might be able to keep the transaction fee semi-reasonable depending on your point of view.

The way bitcoin has been engineered is that adding new miners or nodes does not increase supply for transaction throughput.

"**Market maker**

A market maker or liquidity provider is a company or an individual that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid-offer spread, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a ""market maker"" as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.

A Designated Primary Market Maker (DPM) is a specialized market maker approved by an exchange to guarantee that he or she will take the position in a particular assigned security, option or option index.

"What the CME and CBOE is debating right now is rules governing bitcoin derivatives, specifically futures. Derivatives allow investors to ""play"" an asset while not actually holding the underlying asset - you are making a bet with someone that the future price of bitcoin will be above or below $X - but neither of you actually own the asset. The issue with bitcoin derivatives is volatility. Derivatives are inherently volatile because of the massive leverage associated with them - you don't have to actually own the asset (this is a big reason why the financial crisis happened), but you have financial exposure to the asset. To reduce risk broker dealers require clients to put up collateral in case the bet goes the wrong way. The problem is that with bitcoin being so volatile normal margin amounts might not be enough. The CME and CBOE are trying to iron out these and much more archaic clearing rules right now.

"there are people that have coin to sell and people who want to buy, when you put in a sell order at X price, the exchange finds someone who wants to buy coin at X price and they fill their order with your coin.

It works basically just how you bought it. I hope that made sense.

"Western Union is *not* in the market of transferring huge amounts of money. It's in the market of sending relatively small amounts for personal reasons. Still not in the everyday purchase category, but rarely going above the security deposit/rent range. 

Also, Western Union charges no fees for online bank transfers, for the transfers that *do* have fees, most of them are in the $3-8 dollar range, which is less than the cost of bitcoin fees. Beyond that, when you send or receive a WU transfer you are transferring *spendable* currency that can immediately be used to purchase goods and services without having to pay additional conversion fees. 

Bitcoin does separate itself in that you are unable to send huge amounts of currency with WU (in the 5k+ usd range) but you are with bitcoin. The question is, does that difference in operation justify a market cap of nearly $300 billion?

">Everyone on this sub 'doesnt believe in the coin' LOL.  If you are holding it as a commodity then you dont believe, if you are happy about price increases you dont believe.


Don't tell me what I believe. Why does an investor invest? Because they believe in the product. Sure, there's people who don't know what it is and follow the herd to try to make a quick buck - these are often people who buy at the top - but I am happy about price increases because Bitcoin has an upper limit and needs growth to reach normalcy. Increases in price are related to increases in attention which are related to increases in people who believe which are related to more pressure on developers/possibly new developers entering the space. 


>For anything to be a currency it needs to be relatively stable so people can have price confidence and a slight decrease in value over time to avoid hoarding and to promote liquidity.  


That's arguable. I'm just going to leave it at that for now.

"In my limited understanding, contango is the time value of the contract, and is represented by r, y, q, and u.

Backwardation is when the future is less than the spot, or the near month is less than the far month, and generally could be used to calculate a u which is negative.  A negative benefit to holding the underlying.  I think volatility is implied in the u as well.

So when rolling (long) contracts, you sell a near contract w/ little time value and buy a far contract with more time value, and each time you book a little loss, relative to just holding the underlying.   For commodities, who the the hell can ""hold"" 1mm barrels of CL crude oil?   

But for futures on *tradeable* financial instruments, they should be converge on u = 0 through arbitrage, leaving contango based only on r and q (risk free rate + expected dividends)

My take.  Certainly not a commodities expert though.

Okay, I'm selling now, no need to wait further...

Everyone should do so. the return is great, and to be honest I doubt that I'm going to need more money than that. It's not going to make me happier.

I don't really know the details and legal clauses of bitcoin exchanges, but I don't want to end up in a place where bitcoin is crashing HARD and for some reason bitcoin exchanges would stop doing conversions. I'm sure they could wait for the price to stall and scam a lot of people that way...

That is going to end up in a bloodbath, and I don't want to be part of this.

"I want to start by saying that I don't own any Bitcoin. But I just want to say congratulations and thank you, Bitcoin. Watching this as someone who never invested is a different experience, but makes me happy for a different reason.

I knew the broad strokes of Bitcoin from hearing of it over the years (block chain made sense, mining didn't but knew it made people money). But with the growth of it now, it was something that I felt like I had to get more educated on. Maybe it was just me being a programmer who wanted to be more up to speed on technologies, but I think the growth of it is something that has caused that next portion society to have to take notice. I mean, when you hear someone bought a pizza a few years ago with what would be worth 36 million today (probably more now), you tend to want to know what all happened haha. Then from there I watched, as I think a lot of people have, ""Banking on Bitcoin"" on Netflix and that really opened my eyes to how it works and the purpose behind. But  that's more just my background with it (and that is the limit of my ""background"" with it).

What I am congratulating you guys on isn't the ridiculous amounts of money you have made or your tech savvy-ness for doing this. I'm congratulating you on essentially holding up a sign saying ""look, this works! We know there are issues with the current systems of the world and we, the 'common folk' made a new one that addresses that!"". It shows people that they can be the change they want to see and they can contribute to it. Granted, it is still young and still has growing to do. But it is showing the world that a good idea can be tested and grow even when all the odds are against it. It is going up against what is honestly the most central part of the world that is the (I'd imagine) most nearly impossible to get into. Money. Between banks, giant conglomerates, and whatever else that would probably blow my mind if I knew about, the fact you got it validated like this through all that is INSANE! Honestly if someone said they wanted to make a new kind of currency to me a few years ago, I'd say you'd have to make a new country. But that was an old world way of thinking, and you've shown a new way of thinking is possible and it will help the world grow. 

Tl;dr Congratulations, guys. You changed the world :). ";9;1;False;Jicaar;dqwjleu;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"People need to calm down. This rise should be of concern to everyone. Where are the healthy corrections? Where are people taking profits?

          ‚ÄòBut we have also,‚Äô continued the management consultant, ‚Äòrun into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship‚Äôs peanut.‚Äô
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd.  The management consultant waved them down.
          ‚ÄòSo in order to obviate this problem,‚Äô he continued, ‚Äòand effectively revalue the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and ‚Ä¶ er, burn down all the forests.  I think you‚Äôll all agree that‚Äôs a sensible move under the circumstances.‚Äô

Since bitcoin isn't backed by any other currency or nation could someone ELI5 if there is a likely a bubble about to burst where everyone loses there money or if there is actually some form of safety measure in place that will likely not lead to a bubble bursting.;2;0;False;;dqwlv0b;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"I'm very interested in technology and advocate cryptocurrencies and blockchain which means now that it has wide spread news coverage, everyone I've talked to about it thinks I'm both rich and a genius. Neither are true, but it's definitely exciting to see decentralized tech reach this level of acceptance! 

Ethereum is another cryptocurrency I believe has a solid use-case for the limitations our banking system and fiat faces. Hopefully both can coexist in the future as I can easily see one squashing the other whether it being government regulation on cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency replacing the dollar-based infrastructure as a whole.

"I'm shocked at how fast it's growing these past few months, I'm not sure when to cash in. now? or at least get my initial investment back now and play with ""house"" money? hah. 


heck... I thought I bought in at a **bad** time when I purchased ¬£100 worth (well, about ¬£90 worth after unchangeable fees, thanks to coinbase. I didn't need it in my wallet instantly, rather have saved the ¬£5 mining fees and had it in a few days later... the other ¬£5: I get that you gotta make money, so that's okay. just wish there was an option for lower fees...) when it was at 6k/btc, the gamble paid off though and now I'm happy.



footnote: had I not been an opiate addict, fueling my addiction through dnms, I would be a millionaire right now (or at least a hundred thousandaire). I don't dare go back through my transaction history on localbitcoins as it'd make me sad. I still remember my first BTC transaction... about 0.6btc for ¬£40 when I was a little tween. spent it on weed and thought it was daylight robbery that it cost so much, and was a huge hassle. I thought it'd just be used as an underground currency instead of blowing up like it has, and being legitimate.

">  I think it's more likely this is mass adoption.

Bitcoin hasn't been a viable currency for months. At least years back there was a *chance* for mass adoption but with the sky-high fees and delays in confirming transactions Bitcoin's time to become a legitimate currency is long gone. No one is going to use bitcoin if it either takes hours to process a transaction or ~$5-$6 in fees to buy a cup of coffee. So if BTC is dead as a currency... what's with the price? And that begs the question to Wall Street/investor manipulation. 

That being said other cryptos do show promise in that they can avoid the issues Bitcoin is currently facing. If you are serious about buying into the future of currency I recommend investing elsewhere, not in Bitcoin.

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619‚Äì1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

Why is it such a big deal now compared to the period between $1000 and $2000? People didn't talk about numbers blurring together when it jumped between $1200, $1300, $1400 etc. It's exactly the same percentage rate, just another zero at the end :) I'm halv ironic, I get people are playing with bigger numbers now but the focus is too much at the $$$ and not %.

But why is it rocketing? I found this genius explanation in another thread:  ""Bitcoin is much better described as a virus than a bubble. It is a virus on the global capital metastructure. It will continue to consume capital in every form, and will not stop eating until it is ubiquitous.
The idea that it is a bubble that will burst presupposes that it will soon run out of fuel to continue growing. The amount of fuel available in the world capital markets is immense. The bitcoin growth curve mirrors the standard chart of virus expansion. Expect exponential growth for at least the next 3 years. This thing is hungry and it is loose in the world's largest perti dish. The host has no natural immunity as this virus is of a totally unknown form.

Bitcoin will continue to rise. Altcoins will fall in value. Prices will peak right before the CBOE gemini pricing closing date (dec 9?) And then BTC will plummet. It will fall on dec 10, 11, 12, and stabilize during the week. Perhaps with a small rally during the same week. It too will peak before the CME launch. Then it will drop off the face of the earth as people trade against BTC. As regular investors sell off on the 11th and 19th the exchanges servers will crash further depressing price as people do anything to exit their position. Over the next feww weeks there will be massive selloffs and a price lower than 10k. Then. When the dust has settled and you hear the media talking about what a terrible investment BTC is the banks will quietly come back in and buy up as many coins as they can and prepare for the next pump and dump. This cycle will repeat as long as they can manipulate the market. ;1;1;False;Cookiest;dqwf7dc;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

I know people are telling you to wait, and I don't necessarily disagree, but the entire concept of dollar cost averaging is to NOT wait. You buy on a fixed time schedule so that the dips and rises become averaged. If you start to do things like waiting for a dip you're now playing a whole different game. You're betting you can predict the market - what if that dip doesn't come? Do you keep waiting? How long do you wait?

So the profit taking just hasn't reached the point of need yet for the recentlly invested. 

I'd wager very few people investing right now are doing so not because of a cause but speculation  (i mean gambling). Which for the record is not why I invest in crypto ....

"I don't know man. Do you know how many people are using it? I would not be surprised if this is really growing; considering whats going on in Venezuela for instance. 

And now that we have lightning network demonstrated is also a really positive sign I think. Actually this is one is very big I think; Many people don't realize this because of the FUD, but lightning network seemed to be the favorite scaling solution for the majority of core supporters from early on, and this is a big majority within bitcoin at large. (something many people also aren't aware of because of FUD.) There was always a lot of expectation for bitcoin to take off, if it didn't break down at some point. But scaling seemed to be the biggest hurdle. And now it looks like we are taking it. 

 

FUD itself might also be running out of its power. Surely many of the public spaces have changed quite dramatically because of this; but to me and many others it has become apparent that it doesn't really matter that much. There is a world of difference between the general sentiment you get online and what the intellectuals are actually talking about. In the beginning this was maybe much more stressing than it is now.

Hate to break it to you, but Wall Street people have been buying for months. O agree that this meteoric rise is concerning, but now Bitcoin is legitimately being discussed on the financial news circuit as an investment, not just some niche hairbrained gambling device for the Russians and North Koreans. At some point there will be a big correction, and it could even be today, but when it finally hits the $50,000 mark or so, it will start being concerned a speculative growth investment for traditional hedge funds and high risk mutual funds. At that point it will stabilise like a stock.;1;0;False;therinlahhan;dqwfu45;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

"No one knows for certain what it will do, but know this:  
  
Futures are a sideline bet about whether the price of an asset will go up or down. No one in futures is actually trading the asset. Since the asset isn't being bought or sold, the price of the asset will not fluctuate.  
  
That said, if it somehow became public knowledge that a well known and respected financial institution ordered a $500,000,000 short on BTC via a future, then traders on the exchanges that actually trade BTC may panic sell. The reverse scenario is also a possibility.

I knew a dip is coming, as it went from 8k to 9k in a week, 9k to 10k in 2 days and then 10k to 11k in 12 hours.  
I was sure this trend can NOT continue, so I sold at 11k, the dip was down to 9k, rebought at that and made 15ish % profit.  
However... as I don't keep my money on an exchange I had to pay x2 fees for transactions, take the risk of messing up the addresses and taking the risk of deciding wrongly when is the dip.  
I didn't mess up anything.  
However now I am not sure. I don't have that gut feeling that a dip is coming RIGHT NOW, as I had it at 11k.

I've always agreed with the Bubble and 90s stock market crash comparison but said it wont be so bad or is a thick skinned bubble  because at bitcoins heart, it is a currency. It's not like a useless inflated stock that will become junk. It can and always will be used as a currency giving it value.

BUT now that its being inflated to this insane proportions and actually losing it's one real factor that its a valid currency it is changing into a inflated 2 pump dump stock.

Who knows maybe it turns into a 2 pump dump stock that just keeps endlessly fed but any minor thing that will cause people to stop buying like a another recession or too outrages fees will murder its value.

"Did it jump 4k in a day?

To someone like me who knows zero about investing or crypto currency, it looks like people are just pumping in money to then cash out which would then crash the market in the end.

Bitcoin is clearly a bubble, and when it burst's the people who decided to wait because 'but what if it gets to Xk! I should wait!' are all going to commit suicide when they realize that the tens of thousands of dollars they originally put into bitcoin and were worth millions (total if they had a shit ton), are now worth a pittance. 

When it crashes (and it will) it will crash hard. 

Personally I rather be the guy that cashed out at 16k when I got in at 10k, even though it got to 20k. Than the guy that waited for 20k and it's now worth vastly less than what I paid for originally.

Maybe it's because I am a cautious person, but if someone like me can see that this shit is going to burst, it should be loud and clear to people that actually know about this stuff.

Besides, would you rather be the guy who lost 4k x amount of times, or the guy who had millions but now it's worth nothing.";0;4;False;;dqwith1;1 BTC = $16,000!!! Absolutely Insane!;7i6p4a;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i6p4a/1_btc_16000_absolutely_insane/

"To answer your question though, it will require some effort on your part. You will need to register with an exchange and prove that you are who you say you are (this is because of the fact that your government-backed money will be used to purchase bitcoin) with ID (passport/licence). 

Once the cash is in your exchange account, you purchase bitcoin. Once you're happy with the new price, you sell the bitcoin. Buying/selling is based on the current market price (you can set limits eg if you only want to sell at $20,000) and there will hopefully be buyers willing to buy from you when you want to sell. 

Once that fiat (government backed) currency is back in your exchange account (from the sale) you send it to your bank account and use it as normal. 

So...to answer your question, it's not too hard but it requires some effort on your part. 

The reason I said I'm not sure bitcoin is for you is because using/storing/selling will require a bit of research around security. I would worry that you purchase it and don't secure your private keys and/or leave it on the exchange where it is more susceptible to online attacks. Food for thought.

"> If a currency that the USD is hedged against is growing $1000/day how is the USD doing well?

Because USD is real and can be used to pay down debts.  Banks dont accept payment in bitcoin.  You need dollars, and you need dollars to buy bitcoin in the first place.  The only reason people are excited about bitcoin is so they can temporarily use it to make more *dollars*, because thats the currency of the land.               
                     
> If one day $1 gets me 1 apple and the next $1 gets me 10 apples then the dollar went down in value regardless of what it's fiat-to-fiat relationships are.                          
                                 
Or the price of apples went down.  Or the supply of apples is too high and they need to dump them on the market before they rot and get nothing.  Bitcoin's sudden rise is 100% about the hype of bitcoin, it sets a new record, the media reports it, 1000 more people buy in, it sets a new record, the media reports it, 2000 more people buy in, it's riding a hype train, it's relationship isn't to the dollar, it's relationship is tied to media reporting.  When media reported Mt Gox went bankrupt years ago, bitcoin crashed hard, etc, bitcoin didn't crash because the dollar was strong, it crashed because the media published something very negative about it.  It has nothing to do with the dollar going through some kind of crash, but people *are* opting to crash their bank accounts to buy into the present hype.  You'd have to be high to not take 5 seconds and look up USD value and notice there is no usd crash.

It works the same way as stocks. Sites like coinbase try to abstract it away from you and provide a very simple ""buy"" and ""sell"" interface, but they charge hefty fees and spreads.

"ok first you want to get a wallet from bitcoin.org or what i prefer, print out a paper wallet (if you are going for long term this is the safest).  Then you transfer your bitcoin from coinbase to the paper wallet.

as a long time bitcoiner I can't stress enough how important it is to NOT keep your bitcoins on an exchange like coinbase.

"Would the persons buying future contracts short bitcoin over long bitcoin thereby putting negative pressure on the price? I'm thinking that futures will open up the market to financial institutions whose primary point of view has been that there needs to be a correction yesterday. 
From that view it seems prudent to put in a stop limit from wherever the price is ahead of December 10th and be ready for a possible drop in value.  I'm not suggesting that this would be a long term thing but prices could dip for a while before continuing back up in the future.

"This is already parabolic. This is the effect of the futures we're seeing now. My guess is a few days before futures launch you'll see a lot of swing traders take profit and there will be a significant correction.

I'm also not convinced that big money investors aren't pumping the price now so they can tank it and short with futures. Though I have no evidence of this, call it a hunch.

This kind've parabolic rise is not sustainable in the short term. The longer it increases at this rate the bigger the correction will be. Not sure when it will happen, but it is inevitable.

"Hyper inflation is a monster without doubt, and if/when that starts hitting the traditionally developed countries there will be chaos.  Typical inflation (2-4%) a year is just dealt with by companies doling out 1-3% raises per year.

Historically, before fiat money was a thing and gold (and silver) was king there were long periods of relative price stability, along with some inflation and deflationary time periods.  Either inflation or deflation can be very rough on a company/economy: if you agree to pay your workers a set wage annually and then the prices you can charge for a  good/service drops precipitously, it‚Äôs unlikely your worker will agree to a massive drop in pay to match.

Of course all of that is the past and I think it‚Äôs a bit dangerous to look to the past for guidance on the future beyond learning lessons, but I just think unless the value of BTC can stabilize it‚Äôll be a tough road to adoption.";2;0;False;Gahvynn;dqwpea2;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"> If you‚Äôre pouring your life savings into bitcoin

I did, but my ""life"" savings is only about $3000.  

The last time I invested my life savings in something was law school when I foolishly used the education exception to drain even my IRA, figuring I'd be doing well enough to replenish it right after school.  Nope.  Sold my Apple and Tesla shares to pay for stupid living expenses during school.  Oops.  

I'm not planning to repeat that particular mistake.  I am keeping my budget as tight as possible and investing in parallel with my debt reduction process.  I know that standard financial wisdom is to pay down debt first for guaranteed returns, but so far my bitcoin returns are an order of magnitude greater than what I would get applying to same funds to debt repayment.  I could sell today and have almost enough to pay off my smallest student loan, but I don't see it as worth it.  I'm holding and considering buying more with every spare dollar I can scrape together.

"**Zimbabwean dollar**

The Zimbabwean dollar (sign: $, or Z$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies) was the official currency of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 12 April 2009. During this time, it was subject to periods of above-average inflation, followed by a period of hyperinflation.

The Zimbabwean dollar was introduced in 1980 to directly replace the Rhodesian dollar at par (1:1), at a similar value to the US dollar. Over time, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reduced the Zimbabwe dollar to one of the lowest valued currency units in the world.

"Oh I definitely did, it was a really interesting idea but to me (a lay man) it seemed like it was an ""increasing complexity"" solution rather than a ""simplifying"" solution, which I think is usually preferable when possible (in a generalized sense, not just about bitcoin). Also it seemed like LN presented a lot of potential risk for consolidation of power on a network that's meant to be decentralized.

"I agree, the price will stabilize and outgrow any dip or correction. After bitcoin reached a price of $1000 for the first time it corrected down to between $400-600 and stayed there for years toiling behind the scenes. There had been tons of media hype when the price broke $1k, but the hype was short lived. The same thing happened after bitcoin first hit $300, and when it first hit $30 before that, each with varying time frames.

This time around the media coverage, user base, and interested from traditional finance is much larger. The ecosystem is also much more evolved, so I don't anticipate Bitcoin falling into obscurity again (from a mainstream market point of view). But when the time comes that Bitcoin is no longer the front page story on every financial website, I anticipate a pull back. When that happens I'll wait it out just like I waited out every one before. ";1;0;False;Lex-Mercatoria;dqwo56t;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

Seems to me that the futures just give the institutional buyers an additional tool to play with. If they buy huge amounts of short futures on Monday, it may spook people, and then when the institutions start selling the large positions of actual bitcoin they've accumulated while running the price up this week, the price starts dropping and regular people get rattled even more, start selling off in a panic, further driving the price down‚Äîthen the institutional buyers use their short futures contracts (already purchased for a bargain) to get back more bitcoins on the cheap.

">Not really in general

I'm guessing you are referring to traditional Buy and Hold strategies in investing. Which, you are right, are fine and smart plays when thoroughly flushed out. But I did not refer to a buy and hold strategy. I referred to ""HODL"" mentality, and ""HODL"" mentality is not a buy and hold strategy. Because ""the moon"" is not a defined selling point. Buy and Hold strategies, as used in investing, have defined parameters. While the ""HODL"" mentality has no target price point, it has no hedge against losses, No dividends to pay you for your risk, or any defined sell points that would be associated with a traditional buy and hold.


I believe in bitcoin, but the reality is smart investing exists for a reason. I invested a  chunk of my savings in college, and said ""this is going to 0, or I am selling when it hits $x,xxx."" We hit it, and I sold this year.  It's been hard to stomach the past month, with the price all over the news, in addition to several friends bringing up Bitcoin. But I hit my target price point, and I sold. Because that was the plan. Do I wish I had saved coins, yes. But I made out, and it put me miles ahead financially for my age range. Anyone who has multiple coins right now representing the majority of their assets is a fool for not hedging in some way. Anyone who has made 20X on their money is a fool if they have not sold at least their initial investment of post taxed money.  There is no argument against it.  People are going to kill themselves if there is a bubble (this has literally happened in the past already), and that's not something to fuck around with.

"I get all that, and I agree, except for the ""trust me, that combination will be worth far more than that right off the bat"" claim.  I'm honestly not even sure any of those forks will a.) even go live, b.) be picked up by any exchanges, and c.) be worth more than 1% of bitcoin for more than like..a day.

For example, the Bitcoin Diamond ""development team"" consists of ""EVEY"", ""007"" and ""+"", and their ""operation team"" is ""The Bitcoin Diamond Foundation"".  Their website says it's worth $0.003 BTC, but CoinMarketcap has ""futures"" trading at half of that.  It forked in November, yet there is no mainnet yet.  And this is arguably the most ""professional"" of the upcoming forks.  

I'm not saying that people won't load up on coins, because the MSM tells them fork = free money, but eventually people will realize that shitty alt-forks like these upcoming ones aren't worth the time or risk to even bother with.  If someone is sitting on 10BTC $160k USD, then yeah, they *might* think to themselves ""I can pick up an extra $1000"" through these 3 forks.""

If you make a short bet, you are betting that the price will go down. With a futures contract, you are just speculating on the price, not actually buying the asset itself. BUT if you already have enough of the asset to dump that you can start a downward trend by selling it (this assumes that the large financial institutions are the ones buying and driving the price up now), then you can in effect create a panic and a crash‚Äîwhich makes your futures contracts valuable. Plus, of course, you'll have made a bunch of money as the asset itself rose in price (when you sell it en masse for fiat to start the downward price action). ;2;2;False;bluelevel4;dqwlteb;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"It's not too hard to look at the price charts and see the pattern, strong cryptos spike, then crash, but not as low as they were before the spike started, then work up to a spike again, usually making steady growth along the way. Just look at the overall history of the top 10 or so and you see it over and over. My speculation is that btc will reach near 18-25k then crash to the 9-10 range, eventually growing past wherever it peaked in the long term. As long as the crypto doesn't get completely compromised or there's a great depression situation, btc will remain valuable even if it's just a go between currency from USD to more promising altcoins.

That being said, there will be winners and losers, no one can predict the future, this shit is volatile, and new, and poorly understood, and exciting, and risky, so, don't play with more than you can afford to lose, and use your best judgement.

"**Currency**

A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, ""in circulation"", from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.

"As far as I am aware, even though the swings are bigger its still just an average with bigger numbers and it helps the barrier of entry mindset like what this guy was talking about. Sure if he went all in right now at $17k and it double to $34k he'd be feeling good, but the market might drop soon so he is worried hell lose more by going all in at once. Instead he puts 1/3rd in now 1/3rd in a week from now(or whatever timeline you like) and the final 1/3rd in the week after and he's able to see the market fluctuate. 

This way if it does crash later in the week he doesn't lose as much and can even gain it back by buying in at the cheaper price point.
Inversely, if it were to have spiked straight up to $34k then he could have gained more but he'd have a greater risk and there for greater stress over his investment.

"**Greater fool theory**

The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants. A price can be justified by a rational buyer under the belief that another party is willing to pay an even higher price. In other words, one may pay a price that seems ""foolishly"" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a ""greater fool"" later.

"> Bitcoin is clearly a bubble

It *could* be a bubble, but I wouldn't call it *clearly* a bubble. Bitcoin started from nothing and it might very well still haven't reached its actual market value in the current state of economy. Bitcoin could be a transfer of wealth as people move out of assets like (for example) gold and instead prefer a more liquid and secure asset like Bitcoin where they are in control of their own funds and don't have to go through intermediaries.

With that in mind, it might look like a bubble since it's quickly spiraling out of control, but if you actually look at the property of bitcoin (where it becomes more valuable as more people are invested in it, the amount of people and amount of global reach), you can clearly see that this phenomenon is a one of a kind situation.

If the essence of 'gold' came out a year ago and suddenly the entire world realised how valuable it is, its price would exponentially increase in a very short time as demand rises, very similar to what is happening to bitcoin right now. Does it mean that the current price of gold is a bubble? No, it means that it is just adjusting it to the actual assumed value of the asset. 

This is my opinion of course, it's not fact and it could very well be a bubble. Be skeptical and invest only as much as you are willing too lose, just don't be too quick in calling it a bubble because you might be wrong.";1;0;False;morgawr_;dqwja2x;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"There are futures contracts that call for the delivery of the product (though some/most are settled in cash). So its totally possible that someone gets a futures contract for 1BTC and it actually pays out that 1BTC. For the most part though I think there will just be cash settlements.

The big draw of futures contracts from CME's point of view is that there is real security. There is way less risk that your future for BTC is going to be stolen compared to having actual BTC sitting in a wallet somewhere. It also gets people who don't actually know how to trade BTC into the game, and CME is making money off of all these futures trades.";2;0;False;RIP_Hopscotch;dqwnv5n;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

No one yet knows what exactly will happen Monday from a market perspective (i.e., will price go down, up or trade sideways). Futures and options will allow you to create put/call options on bitcoin. This type of margin trading will lead to people making heavy gambling trades (you have to prove equity in margin trading... seen people lose their savings and houses on the stock market) on if BTC will rise or fall by a specific date while keeping your buy or sell price at a specific point no matter what the current price is. You can even trade that call/put to someone else for a loss or gain before that specific future date you called. So if you have big firms all shorting BTC Monday you can bet they will make sure the market will fall soon after. My assumption is this pump is unhealthy and by default there must be a correction at some point which traders will take advantage of.;9;0;False;galacticdancer;dqwn44z;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

Exactly this. I think a lot of people newer to Bitcoin are thinking of it like a game of musical chairs. Buy and take profits before the music stops. What these people and people from traditional finance do not/will no/can not realize is that many people who have been involved with Bitcoin from the beginning or early on (many of the devs, miners, and outspoken proponents) see it as a dynamic shift in the way the world will create and utilize financial networks.

"I'm in a similar boat.   I'm kinda torn between being excited and nervous.   if it does go down between now and then, I'm planning to just sit on it til it goes back up, as I don't get the impression that its likely to stay below around that indefinitely,  and it should come back to at least break even eventually. 
but if its still really high when the check clears, I might split a big chunk of what I have into BTH or something to diversify it.  I'm at an awkward spot where if the amount I put in is locked up for a year+, it would be possibly inconvenient, but not the end of the world... completely gone would be really frustrating, but if the people who think this is just the start of the moonshot are more than like, a quarter correct, it could be massively life changing.

"> Will anybody be brave enough to try and short this beast?

Of course they will. Shorting isn't some grand scheme. Like every investment decision, it's a risk. But with bitcoin it's a sensible risk given the volatility and how it takes two steps forward, one step back. In this case it's going to be 10 steps forward, 7 steps back.

"Keep in mind, it's only real if you sell.

At some point the price will hang, and people will ask if it's the top, and people will sell a little, prices will dip, that'll force some into the red, a few more sell, some will go further in the red, they'll panic sell, the market could crash over the course of minutes or hours.

Nobody is calling me to ask me how it works or why it's useful, they're calling me to ask how many I'm holding and if I still think it's a good time to buy.  People are getting in without a clue on what the fuck Bitcoin is or does.

Do not make plans off of money you don't have.  This mania will end.  At the current transaction fees and mining electricity costs, bitcoin is a ridiculous failure of a currency - if one of these alt coins that is up-and-coming takes that place, bitcoin is nothing but the dream that someone will pay more.

I hold a very tiny amount of btc, but im sure there are many people with millions worth. If a large amount of people or even one person wanted to liquidate millions worth, how would they do it? Where would the money come from? It is not backed by any major bank or the government. It all reality it is just a digital code. Where would the hundreds of millions of USD come from if many big holders cash out? Or maybe you cant cash out?;1;1;False;cof9;dqwwhzr;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"The best thing one could do is sell right before the big dip/bubble burst and then buy back in when it's at its lowest. Right?

My question being pretty much new here (bought in at ~11k USD for some change) is that **is it realistically doable? Is it possible to pinpoint the moment when the downward spiral will start?** Or is it a 100% gut thing? I've read about people who have made huge mistakes trying to execute this move and the dip didn't come at all making them lose out on a alot of gains.

I understand the idea that even when the dip comes, It will probably go below the point where I bought in, making me lose money, but in the long run it will go up even higher where it is now. So in the long run I'm still okay. Nevertheless the excitement of the option of selling right before the dip and then buying at the low point is very enthralling.

Any advice guys?";1;1;False;KenKeff;dqwn1oc;1 BTC = $16,000!!! Absolutely Insane!;7i6p4a;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i6p4a/1_btc_16000_absolutely_insane/

Its just the area we arediscussing it worth trillions of dolars so of COURSE as adoption happens the numebrs will be large.

By the way $20,000 isnt large. Its peanuts.

I used to think Bitcoin was on the verge of collapse. I was wrong, I underestimated the stupidity of Wall Street and financial institutions and their willingness to stoke an already existing bubble. Now I've seen investors talking about buying BTC to put in pensioner portfolios, once they can, and these people are out of their minds. Now that the institutional investors are getting on, I think it could go much higher. Of this keeps going, breaks 40-50k, then crashes back to earth, I think we will be approaching 'bailout' territories, once again, or will be if this continues for another 6 months.;1;0;False;Pequeno_loco;dqwml52;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

So as a new bitcoin owner I am seeing a different perspective why this is going up. So few days ago bitcoin went full mainstream, not because people care what is represents or what is is, where just realized they could make tons of $$. So you insane amount of people registering and dumping $$ into bitcoin, and they don't know what bitcoin is... my feeling is this bubble won't be coming soon, I feel this thing will go to 40K to 100K before it bursts. Also at the same time I feel people will keep throwing money at bitcoin until you can't throw anymore into it... so if its 1,000,000 then that's where it might end up.;29;6;False;slingxshot;dqwhszt;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"Quick question.  I won‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a crypto skeptic, but I am not quick a full convert either.

I see several opinions on what is going to happen with Bitcoin in the future.

It seems a contingent believe it is the future of the economy and that fiat currency will fail  and people will start demanding to be paid in bitcoin for their goods and services and that it will be a terrible transition but sometime down the road after the dust settles the world economy will be more stable, ‚Äúfair‚Äù, and that people who had large amounts of bitcoin (today‚Äôs HODL crew) will be the new elite/rich class so they should avoid using bitcoin for transactions until the future happens.

Then there seems to be another group that also believes bitcoin will be the future of the world economy but the only way that it will happen is to use bitcoin for transactions.

Another subset seems to view it as *maybe* it‚Äôll be the future, but it‚Äôs a good store of value and you should HODL until it hits a point where you can achieve your dreams.

Then another views it as a way to trade about and try to make quick fat money, not really overly concerned about future adoption.

I‚Äôm sure there are other people somewhere in between, but between the two ‚ÄúBTC is the future‚Äù crews, there seems to be a directly opposing agenda, that is one views the only way forward is to let the world economy collapse and the other is that actually using it as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services will spread adoption.

"I am starting to convince myself this is an orchestrated pump and dump. There are many hedge funds who have delved deep into Bitcoin now, and what is going on looks like a classic strategy.

As I mentioned in the previous thread, this is my theory:

1. They are clumsily buying up coins, that is to say, they're not being subtle in how their orders are handled (which a stock trader would for instance, in order to prevent the price from going up before their full purchase is filled). This is to purposefully increase the price whilst increasing their stock.

2. When futures go live, buy puts (a put is a short position - i.e. price goes down, put value goes up) like there's no tomorrow, they'd likely go balls-deep in puts, expect huge order sizes on launch.

3. They will then chuck enormous sell blocks at the market to scare the shit out of all hodlrs, stimulating a price crash. 

4. Put prices rocket on back of price pullback - sell puts at mega profit

5. Repurchase bitcoin or walk away with profit. More likely the former to rinse and repeat.

Pump and dumps are illegal in stocks, currency, etc. but would be much easier to hide in Bitcoin.

How to defend? Execute a short squeeze:

""A situation in which a heavily shorted stock or commodity (Bitcoin) moves sharply higher, forcing more short sellers to close out their short positions and adding to the upward pressure on the stock. A short squeeze implies that short sellers are being squeezed out of their short positions, usually at a loss.""

By buyers rapidly increasing the price and volume at which they buy Bitcoin, we can ""squeeze"" shorters out of their positions. Look at Icahn vs. Ackman with their Herbalife battle as an example of a nicely executed squeeze. Ackman had to close out his short position and restructure a new short position.

Whilst these shorts are structured as futures, it means you can't technically *squeeze* anyone out of their position. However, if the BTC price were to continue going up, these futures would become worth less and less, and hedgies using leverage may be closed out by their brokers (if they don't increase margin cover) in effect being squeezed.

 tl;dr - When Bitcoin price starts to plumment, buy Bitcoin.

I can't imagine many mainstream companies are doing much crypto investing.  Generally, aside from equity stakes in other companies in the same vein you dont find much investment other than very liquid treasury bonds or similar.  Companies that make profits from selling or manufacturing couch cushions or red Solo cups generally would find cryptos outside their risk tolerance.  Excess funds that can't immediately invested into the business or safely invested are going to be returned to shareholders as a dividend or stored in close to cash investments.;1;0;False;ElscottHavoc;dqx10d9;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

When I was in school years ago, I had a classmate who was just getting into bitcoin. It was priced like $250ish or so? And I laughed at him, telling him what a stupid idea bitcoin is and the whole cryptocurrency was just some bullshit ponzi scheme.

Then it went up to like $1200 and he kept on and I laughed at him, sayin it was gonna pop and he would lose a ton of money. 

It eventually did, I think and dropped down to what, like 600? I ended up buying like $300 in ships in Star Citizen instead of buying half a bitcoin.

"It's called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and in my honest opinion its the wrong reason to get in. Bitcoin is not a get rich fast scheme and it will at some point drop 20% or 30% or even more, then it will go up again and then it will drop a little again. Most of us are not gonna be around when the final bitcoin is mined in 2140, even less can tell if it truly will be around then.

If you believe in BTC, then I advice you to set up a buy where you feel you are standing safely with your feet on the ground. Do not invest recklessly based on emotions, you will react with emotions when absolutely harmless things happen (e.g Sell when it drops 5%) and then you will be even more anxious about buying back in if it starts rising. Its a dangerous vicious cycle.

"In order to crash a commodity, it means a flood of supply can occur, or demand dries up.  A supply flood can only occur if someone sells, either because they have holdings, or because they mined it.

Regarding holdings, no one with major holdings will cause that to happen, in the same way DeBeers will not just suddenly sell their diamonds even though their horde of diamonds can supply demand for 100s or 1,000s of years.  This is because with holdings that vast, you cannot sell at spot, and will need to vwap slice over many years or decades, and by the time you sell off even 2% of your holdings at a profit, you've tanked the price and sent the remaining 98% of your holdings into the ditch.  This is not economically rational, and rational actors with vast holdings will sell as little as they can without impacting price, which for thinly traded commodities, is a negligible amount.  With skewed gini coefficients, there just aren't enough aggregate holdings under small investors where en masse panic selling by minor players causes draw downs of more than 20-40% dips.

Regarding miners, they are the only other actor who can flood a market with supply, and while diamond miners are a huge problem for DeBeers, enough to brand this competition as conflict diamonds and to try to start a culture of certificates that show your diamond was not mined from non-cartel mines, miners are only a problem if the actual commodity lacks scarcity.  Since diamonds are not scarce, miners will always be a problem and attempt to dump diamonds on the market since they are not large holders like DeBeers and can sell their minor holdings at spot and be willing to drive the price down as they mine and sell for a profit.

There are 800 million carats of diamonds in proven mines, and given spot diamond prices (retail) of $1,400 per 0.5 carat and a mean carat size of 0.5, there's a supply of $2.2tn in diamonds at current valuation.  You might ask, ""what about industrial use?  Aren't diamond drill bits useful to the economy?""  Yes, industrial use is huge, and none of it comes from diamond mines since synthetic lab-grown diamonds are far cheaper for industrial use and they don't care about a DeBeers certificate stating their diamond was conflict-free.  This is a $2.2tn reserve of diamond supply at current retail valuation.  Let that sink in.

Bitcoin supply by contrast is constrained, since it achieves scarcity through cryptography.  Miners have to struggle with electricity and hashing power to get lottery tickets toward each 10-minute mining reward.  These rewards keep shrinking exponentially so we currently have 18M bitcoins out of a total 21M bitcoins that can exist under this protocol.

The only other way to crash the price is for demand to dry up.  However, for speculative commodities, demand lags price movements, not leads it.  That means while demand and price may have some weak correlation, it usually is the price plummeting (and languishing for an extended period of time) that precedes a fall in demand.  The post-Mt. Gox crash and ensuing multi-year lull removed Bitcoin from the zeitgeist of popular media, and there it may have forever languished, had it not been for organic demand that kept growing as speculative demand had all but erased.  Once organic demand grew large enough to justify a price incline, speculators jumped back in for the dizzying year we've had so far while organic demand has stagnated due to multiple factors that relate to each other such as price instability, long tx confirm delays, high fees, negative merchant adoption rate, etc.  Yet, organic demand is on a *long-term* up trend, so even though we're in a localized period of stagnation for that use-case, there is underlying long-term uptrend to the entire asset class.  The short-term demand spike due to speculators, driven by the steep price trend line, will vanish *after* a crash, and it may exacerbate the crash, but it will not and cannot dry up before the crash.

The ""whales"" with vested interest will, if anything, market-make and buy the dips using leverage (leverage allows them to utilize the paper value of their holdings without selling).  This has reinforced speculators to also follow suit and buy the dips and adhere to ""hodl"" culture.  The only way to break self-reinforcing behavioral economics like this is if a large holder decides to break form and dump 100,000 BTC or more.  The only two entities capable of that level of dumping would be Satoshi Nakamoto himself or the FBI due to their asset seizure of SilkRoad.  Gemini and the Winklevoss twins, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, and other Bitcoin players are too vested in the ecosystem to screw that up.  Even Roger Ver in his attempt to resuscitate Bitcoin Cash has not dumped a significant portion of his original Bitcoin holdings, although he has moved a minority portion.  Dumping and sending the asset into a death spiral is not economically rational, since organic demand creates a floor and returns it to an organic price incline.

The only party to make such an economically self-damaging decision may be the FBI mismanaging their SilkRoad asset seizures, or someone who is not currently long and wishes to amass a large short position to the tune of billions of dollars.  Those who tried to short bitcoin at even levels of $50 million were sorely burnt.  And in order to short, you will need to send fiat to an exchange that has enough ""locates"" (bitcoins in cold storage) for the seller to borrow from.  This creates a problem because whales don't keep their assets on-exchange, so the cold storage is primarily of minor players who will panic sell on a crash.  As panic sellers sell, and the counter-party being whales who buy on the dip and move their newly bought coins off-exchange, the exchanges will need to issue a margin call to short-sellers as there aren't enough bitcoins left in cold storage.  This will cause a short-squeeze and a rally, that cascades into more margin calls and forms a viscous cycle eroding the short-seller of value.  The fact that short-sellers cannot access ""locates"" from off-exchange long whales is an accidental benefit that cryptocurrencies have against massive shorts.

TL;DR:  supply will not go up, demand is high and will not go down.  The only shocks to this system would be for massive dumping by irrational actors.  Govt will not shut down bitcoin out of malice, but through ineptitude can crash the price.";6;0;False;geezorious;dqx2zd8;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

Yes you want a stop order on gdax, preferably a stop limit order. A normal stop order creates a market order as soon as the stop price is breached. A stop limit order creates a new limit order at a set price when the stop price is breached. Both have issues in wildly volatile markets and on overloaded exchanges. The market order after the stop is breached could execute for hundreds or thousands of dollars lower than the stop price.;1;0;False;flat_top;dqwq122;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"well that's the thing right. A dip causes three things:

1) panic among the weak, who panic sell because they think it's the habbenign and BTC is dead. This further drops the price.

2) day traders trying to make a quick buck, and cashing out before it dips further, to try and buy back when it's lower. amplifies the dip to an extent, then helps the recovery as they buy back

3) the hodlers who don't care if it dips 20-30%, if anything, they've gained a taste for blood, they're salivating at the chance to buy at a lower price because they've been hodling and have seen what happens if you stick it out, and are dying to put more money into it.

These are price corrections, and once they dip down they reload the spring that pops it back up 20x-30x. The questions isn't whether or not it's going to come back up after a dip, it's how many times is it going to dip and shoot up before the dips only become 5x-10x, then 1x-5x, then we will be in a stable price range and bitcoin will shift from a buy and hold market to a trading market.

">as long as there's a downturn, it won't look anything like 2013.

Which is pretty much what I said.  We need a major correction.  If price just races to $100,000, that's what 2013 looked like - price went from $10 to $1000, a 100-fold increase in under a year's time.

The equivalent this time would be $1,000 to 100,000.   It is indeed happening, but to be healthy, it should take at least until 2020 to reach that price level.

"That's a fallacy. You are thinking about it as a game and that you lost, if you end up having to buy for more.

In reality, it's a game of averages. What's so bad about losing 10%? We are up thousands since we started.

Caling tops and bottoms at this scale is certainly not stupid. You can sell now for 16k. If tomorrow it ends up at 18k, sure, you lost some. Don't have regrets, you might have made the right call. Buy again at some loss. You sold because of the chance of it dipping by 20% or even down to something like 10k.

You are betting no matter what and you can lose out no matter what. If it was roulette, I wouldn't bet on a dip right now. But the result is not betting on red or black it's betting on the 00.

"People didn't trust gold coins when they were first introduced. It took a generation or two until it was commonplace.

Same thing with paper notes.

Same thing with online banking.

We're just in the generation where many of our peers are too traditional to be forward thinkers, but when the 5 and 6 year olds today are 30, 40, 50.. It's going to be bitcoin, because by that time  it will have been around for decades already.

Me and you are probably never going to see the day where the globe runs on a single currency. We might one day see it work side-by-side with fiat in day to day life but even that is decades away.

Just leave enough for your kids and realize some of the gains while you're alive

The [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) on bitcoin is a great resource to start with. Please don't take the abstract at face value and make assumptions that it is a currency like everyone else has been doing. Bitcoin is a *protocol* which is laid on top of the blockchain, just like email was laid on top of the internet. Currency is just a really great example for *one particular use case* of this evolving technology set.;19;3;False;n8bit;dqwllwp;NEWCOMERS. Don't be worried if we see a $6000-$7000 correction soon.

"It‚Äôs hard!  Prior to the bitcoin growth this year, this space was filled with information and eager users building a project.  People shared good info, helped each other, and one out of ten threads *if that* was a price thread.  Now it has one good post for every ten price threads.  Which is fine, (or not depending on your perspective), but to make my point, it‚Äôs harder to find good info on here among all the newbies and people just here to make money.
Thankfully, bitcoin is very straightforward.  I wish I could tell you a great place to start, but I learned ‚Äúalong the way‚Äù and probably couldn‚Äôt tell you where all I have gone.

"People who talk in these terms don't seem to understand the nature of the credit system or the economy in general. Bitcoin is fundamentally a deflationary currency i.e. it gains value the more people are using it (because there is a limited supply). This means that it would be moronic to ever loan someone Bitcoin. But loans and credit are what stimulates economic expansion and growth. Even in the regular world, when people are hoarding currencies there are *severe* economic consequences. Say what you want about the Fed, but if they hadn't essentially printed money in 2008 to inject liquidity into the banking system the entire world economy would have completely gone down in flames.

Say you put down a few thousand, and it grows into an amount that can put a big deposit down on a house.

Look at $10.  Look at $1000.  That's about a year apart.   I don't care if you want to divide that into two rallies, my point is about the 100x price increase in the span of about a year.

I'm not yelling ""bubble"".  You can call it whatever you like.  My point is that it's healthier for price not to increase so fast.  It's dangerous.  If Bitcoin gets set up for another huge crash or bear market, it won't be good for us.

"If you actually read the thread you would know the discussion was about the current state of bitcoin. And future development and the lightning network had already been mentioned.

Currently if I went to buy a 2‚Ç¨ ceffee using bitcoin I would have to pay almost 10‚Ç¨ in transaction fees. That sure is retarded, isn't it? And it adds up, if you used bitcoin exclusively, during a year you would be spending thousands just on transaction fees. Whereas using cash, credit, or debit card there are no fees. In fact, if you use a credit or debit card you usually get some percentage bonus.

The lightning network will take a long time to adapt. And once it is adapted, there is still going to be a fee, even if its only a couple of cents. But at that point it could be somewhat more usable. Especially if the price of bitcoin has stabilised to be actually useful as a currency.

Not if you are using segwit so no.

> whereas using cash, credit, or debit card there are no fees. In fact, if you use a credit or debit card you usually get some percentage bonus.

You realize that the fees you pay for credit cards are hidden right? The person who accepts it has to pay a % to the credit card company. Theres a reason that after 2008 all credit card companies are worth 10-12x more.

Cash is subject to inflation so you lose value there. Maybe in the US you dont see it as much but poorer countries get raped by inflation.

Currently Bitcoin is a safe store of value that is uncorrelated to anything so its a good hedge for ANY portafolio.

Pointing that fees increase when the network gets clogged every time is getting stale. We already fucking know it. We already have a fix incoming so there is no fucking point in repeating it again and again since we cant do anything at the moment.

"as far as I have dug up, the cool thing about blockchain is its ability to be updated to higher demand like that lightning networking that may come out with er in a few months or a year or two. What I know is its supposed to make fees more manageable for everyday purchases as well as much quicker for the everyday use with all the people who could be using it. While miner fees would go down so they would get less per transaction I think they should be validating more transactions so it should even out somehow (maybe even increase).

Bitcoin as it is currently isnt the best currency, but with all the money being thrown into bitcoin right now there is huge incentive for its development potential to grow- I even argue that bitcoin evolving into a more sustainable currency is more likely than people shifting to an altcoin for transactions because bitcoin has so much hype behind it and is being adopted into new markets as well as showing its resilience through multiple currency forks that only grew the price.

So yeah while bitcoin might now be the best way to buy stuff right now and its great for those looking to make a stressful thousand dollars if you play your cards right, I think many hodlers are really invested in the potential of the currency to see updates like the lightning network to create and actual sustainable currency that will be accepted at even more places. I figure at that time the price of the currency will not vary as greatly as we see today and this is just finding that number that it will balance out at. It could be almost nothing or 1,000,000 USD that it mostly evens out at and I think the hodlers are thinking that it will be on the upper end of things since weve seen such a large trend of people jumping on board when they don't understand it and think its just a huge bubble. Imagine if people began to understand where their money was going and see the potential a decentralized currency can get them- no borders, no limits.

Honestly, I don't know if people talked about it, but I wonder what would stop something like paypal from integrating a bitcoin conversion into its accounts to where I could use my bitcoin to pay in USD or whatever other currency wherever paypal is accepted (which is lots of places online at least)

"**Exit scam**

An exit scam is a confidence trick where an established (usually illegal) business, e.g. a seller of drugs, stops shipping orders while continuing to receive payment for new orders. If the entity had a good reputation, then it can take some time before it is widely recognized that orders are not shipping, and the entity can then make off with the money paid for unshipped orders.

Exit scams can be a tempting alternative to a non-fraudulent shutdown for illegal operations, if the operation was going to shut down anyway for other reasons.

"Futures are a way to speculate. Two people agree to trade some commodity at a price determined beforehand, at a future date. 

So say I have 1 BTC at 17k right now. I think it's going to crash and want to get rid of it. You think it's going to soar to 50k. So we make a deal; you agree that no matter what the market price is in a month, you'll buy my BTC a month from now for 25k (less than you think it'll be worth and more than I think it'll be worth). If, in a month, the price is above 25k, you win, because you're getting a discount (and I also win because you paid more for it than I did). If it's crashed, you've just paid 25k for something worthless (and I've won because I've dumped a worthless asset for 25k). 

Options are the same thing, except you don't have to buy if you don't want to, so the margins are quite different since the risk for the seller is much higher.";10;2;False;nliausacmmv;dqwq5jz;NEWCOMERS.

"Why would that be a limit? Why could a Satoshi not equal 5 cents? 

I think the idea behind that number is some hypothetical on the maximum economic value Bitcoin could come to represent, but I'm not sure you can measure that in USD as it is now and expect that same measurement to be relevant then. 

Or in other words, that would be an incredibly high value and it's hard to say what would happen to other currencies were Bitcoin to get there. I don't think it makes sense to assume USD would represent the same value as it does now.

there does seem to be a minimum threshold. it's easy to see if we just take the extreme. If BTC magically crashed to 1$ a piece tomorrow, people would go nuts buying up so much BTC it would be insanity, servers would crash, and the price would skyrocket. YOu can imagine that the price would skyrocket so fast that it wouldn't even crash that low to begin with, as people go crazy buying even at 10$, or 100$, or 1000$. As BTC rises, that threshold increases. Now that it's hit over 16/17k, if it dipped as low as 10k again people would buy up tons of BTC being sold by the panic-sellers.;1;0;False;Harnisfechten;dqwt1sm;NEWCOMERS.

"""know bitcoin has the potential to reach over 100k so easily""

that's still a hard sell.  It COULD easily, anyone can see that.

Will it? Harder to say.  If it drops 50% over night, will you still think that?  Will it be ""easy""?

I think personally, we'll see a BIG drop off in BTC soon and a HUGE raise in alt coins. Specifically, alt coins that solve real world issues, and alt coins that are networks like ethereum, ardor, lsk, and xem, alt coins that solve privacy like monero and dash, and alt coins that fix quick cheap payments, like lite coin, monoco and tenx pay cards, etc.  

Then again, with the possibility of atomic swaps, there are alts still in the works like HYBRID that will be able to cross swap between ALL major crypto networks, allowing transactions to happen through one network and swap to another instantly.  This will be a game changer.

Will BTC be the value holder from which all other Crypto bases itself?

It used to be one.  I bought lots of shit with btc.  If I had just held it instead of using it to buy things, I'd be a millionaire.  Literally.

I still believe it has legitimate store of value purposes.  And it could become a currency again, there's lots of tech promises waiting in the wings which could restore that functionality.  But I rather suspect another Altcoin will fill that slot and insert itself for that use case before bitcoin manages to do so.

"Yes. Bitcoins have value in two ways: what you can sell the coin for and what you can buy with it. 

We‚Äôre currently in ‚Äúphase 2‚Äù of bitcoin where most value comes from what you can sell it for. Phase 1 was the ‚Äúfree money‚Äù days when it was easily mineable. In phase 2, mining for coins is still possible but only makes sense for large farms. I mine with a GPU and it pays for itself, but you‚Äôre not going to make money that way. 

As phase 2 progresses, the price will increase as more people adopt bitcoin (notice I didn‚Äôt say invest in). 

Eventually we‚Äôll reach phase 3 and see equilibrium on money going into and out of bitcoin. The price will stabilize and, with improvements like Lightening Network, we‚Äôll start to see more places accept it for payment and then the value in bitcoin will be in what you can buy with it.

">(1) Are hardware wallets really that much of a no-brainer? Is it worth it to go with a brand name like Trezor? 

Yes. Hardware wallets allow very easy access to your coins and keep them safe in your own possession.  The problem with leaving your coins on an exchange is that the exchange may fail, it might be down for maintenance, etc.  and you don‚Äôt want to lose control of your money like that.  There are a few drawbacks to a hardware wallet.  The problem with hardware wallets is that your coins are not ‚Äúon‚Äù the exchange and therefore selling cannot be don‚Äôt quickly.   First you need to send your coins from a hardware wallet to an exchange (waiting for x amount of confirmations) and then sell them.  Or use your hardware wallet to directly pay someone.  The security of the hardware wallet is 100% in your own hands, but it‚Äôs ultimately the way to go.  I personally have felt very nervous using the hardware wallet, but after testing it out with very small transactions, i now have piece of mind that my coins are safe and in my control.  Some people prefer leaving that in the hands of the exchange and no one here will support that or tell you to do that.  For the price, a Trezor or ledger nano-s is the only hardware wallet I would consider and I recommend you buy either one right now.

> 2) After only a few weeks on Coinbase, I can't help but feel that they partake in a bit of price-fixing, and have convenient outages during downturns. Am I sap for using CB over other exchanges? 

Coinbase, like all other exchanges do not run on the same price because of buys/sells that take place on each exchange differently.  One thing to know is, if you believe they are misrepresenting the price, is that it goes both ways.  If you think they are ripping you off on the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù price and asking too much? Well then a seller will get the same price and jump for joy.  It goes both ways and I don‚Äôt think they fix the prices.  The only place they ‚Äúget you‚Äù is in their company‚Äôs convenience/transaction fee which is additive to the normal bitcoin fee.  It‚Äôs a fee that GDAX doesn‚Äôt have/is less and varies from exchange to exchange.   Supposedly for that fee you can get the Coinbase vault to cold store and protect your coins and do other various things like have a convenient app to use, so you are paying for that definitely but I don‚Äôt think they are scamming anyone if those people read the fee structure etc. ";3;0;False;mathaiser;dqwy299;NEWCOMERS.

">It really just depends on how fast the rest of the people in the world adopt bitcoin

What incentive is there to use a deflationary currency? Who exactly is going to be using Bitcoin for transactions instead of dollars? Even now I find it ironic that Bitcoin is always quoted in terms of its ratio to dollars. All of the big hubbub surround Bitcoin is FOMO morons chasing unsustainable returns. There's no big slate of large retail distributers planning to start accepting Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is currently being traded as a commodity. Like gold, it is and always will be fundamentally worthless (except you can't wear Bitcoin jewelry).

I wanna have a quiet coffee break for once. People keep pestering me about Bitcoin.

I'm a natural bear, for freaks sake. Can't help it, that's the way i was made. 

People always want me to explain how to invest in Bitcoin. My instincts *always* tell me to not invest into... anything, really. 

Please, everyone, just go away with your optimism, your happyness and your i-am-going-to-be-rich dreams. Just let me enjoy a nice moment of doom and gloom and let me drink my coffee before it's getting cold.

I tried to time the ""dip"" when they were a few thousand each and sold 3 when they were roughly $4000. This madness will continue so hold on.

Then it hit 6 and I thought that there was no point to invest anything now because I wouldn't get anything meaningful out of it.

"Anyone got any thoughts on why the below is wrong.. I don't really undertand it fully, but it seems to me that a flash crash of bitcoin is the most likely scenario on the settlement date of the new bitcoin futures contracts...

I'm wondering what is causing the big rise in Bitcoin at the moment.
It must have a correlation with the Bitcoin Futures release...
But why such a huge change.. it is literally billions?

I reckon the reason is below:
The futures market is regulated.. but the cryptomarket is not.

The futures contracts have a fixed settlement date, and settlement is in cash.
Is Manipulating the crtypto mkt illegal, given it is unregulated?
Manipulating the futures market is illegal definitely.

To flash crash the price of Bitcoin  -- you only need to sell the number of bitcoins that have open orders on a number of exchanges (those listed as fixings for the futures contracts). 
This represents < 0.5% of the total bitcoin mkt cap. (yes yes... get a link to this data point)

So are some very wealthy people/organisations (let's call them Donald) going to take out massive short position on bitcoin futures (say 2Bn)... and stock up on the physical bitcoins (say 1Bn)?
Then on the day of settlement, sell all their physical bitconis on the exchanges, and flashcrash the price at exactly the fixing time/date.

They'd make ~1Bn by doing this. And the average Jo holding bitcoin would lose big time, if their stop loss orders get triggered.

I think the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the Market Makers (Let's call them Jill)
Now Jill took the futures order and is 2Bn long bitcoin futures ... if the price increases by the settlement date, she's made money.. but if it falls, she's lost.
So Jill decides to hedge. (Jill is a mkt maker, so makes her money from the spread betwen the buy and sell price of the futures contracts)
Jill needs to sell physical bitcoin (2Bn worth to hedge her 2Bn long futures contract).. so she goes to a physical exchange and enters a 2Bn short position.

So the bitcoin price here (physical) is net very down by 1Bn of exchange orders (Donald 1Bn buy... Jill 2Bn sell). But we have to think about timing too.

1) In the build up prior to buying the futures contract, Donald is buying 1Bn.. the price of Bitcoin is skyrocketing
2) Remember -- no futures contract yet --- so Jill has not hedged
3) When Donald sells the futures contract (and Jill Buys)..  Jill sells 2Bn physical bitcoin... the price of Bitcoin falls to a lower point than previous...*
And on time of settlement everything gets back to net flat... right?
4) Donald dumps his 1Bn physical bitcoin at 1 minute prior to the fixing time on a number of different exhanges - bitcoin price decreases to 10 USD
5) Jill is long 2Bn futures and short 2Bn physical (net flat). The futures is about to settle 2Bn out of the money... and the physical is 2Bn in the money...
6) The futures contract settles and Jill quickly unwinds the long position whilst the price is 10 USD.. otherwise she's lost a lot of money!!

Right.. so all is rosy in this perfect world.. right?

WRONG!!!
1) The avg Jo is buying bitcoins during the uptrend.. making money, and covering with stop losses
2) The stop lossess get triggered on the flash crash. The avg Jo loses all their money.
3) In this perfect world.. all exchanges are working perfectly all the time... (oh dear).
4) The timing between Donald dumping his 1 Bn physical and Jill unwinding her 2Bn physical position needs to be exact otherwise, a mkt maker has just lost a hell of a lot of money
5) BTW A mkt maker exposed or losing this amount of money introduces systemic risk to the financial system 
6) Is Jill going to perfectly hedge her exposure as all good market makers do?
7) Is Donald's network working well at 1 minute before the fixing

Of course the above scenario can have exactly the converse too.... but the sudden price rise, indicates that the big crypto short play by Donald is the most likely at the moment.
Is this a good thing?
The liquidity on futures contracts will be significantly higher than on the physical exchanges... and mkt makers will think they are net flat.. no skin off their nose...

In the above, Donald can equally represent the net of the positions taken on all futures contracts and assumes mkt makers are willing to have a net directional exposure to futures hedged by an offsetting position in physical.";2;0;False;urbanStigmata;dqwt3z9;NEWCOMERS.

You own some part of a Bitcoin (or many). If it falls below what you paid for by 10%, you've incurred a loss of 10%. And of course there are possibly fees with the medium you used to purchase, such as if you're being charged markup by an exchange or paying transaction fees. Btc would have to be valued at 0 for you to lose everything or negative for you to owe anything. The latter obviously doesn't make sense.

"I try not to pay attention to too many of those kind of predictions just because no one really knows. Just like the upcoming start of bitcoin futures trading... I think we're all interested to see what happens. 

Sure... Supply and demand and with the limited 21 million supply, anything is possible. I still can't believe it's where it's at after watching/buying it between 10-1000k for years. While going above a mil, 500k, or even 100k is wanted I hesitate to predict it going that high. It's another I can't wait to see it, but I'll believe it when it happens. Even then, I'll probably still be in disbelief. 

It has been climbing rapidly since it broke 10k so I'm not sure. Realistically, I think it'll eventually settle between the 10-15k(keyword: eventually). Since the next halving happens in 2020, we'll probably see another run up then. 

I'm thinking more in the 50-75k range by 2020 but that's just a supply and demand guess. 

It's a weird dynamic with constantly seeing articles that reference store of value versus currency. It seems to be doing well at being a store of value but I see bitcoin or crypto currency in general as a currency(and store of value). I personally would like to see bitcoin take over as the primary currency but in the current climate, it seems like it's content with staying primarily a store of value/wealth.

Before I start rambling more than I already have, I'll end this here. :-P

"It's a part of technical Analysis..Look up Elliott Waves and Fibonacci Retracement

They are theories of how psychology of the buyer has just as much to do with the price increases/decreases of a market (basically FOMO pushes price higher, FUD pulls price down, etc)

Basically when the price is at any low point and starts going up, you get a 5-part wave that goes Up, Down, Up, Down, Up. So it might go from $1 to $30 to $15 to $60 to $35 to $100

The idea is that by the time you get to $100, there are excited buyers in the market just trying to get in on the increase, so there's no solid basis for the price, thus it's inevitable the market correct itself from the buyers getting carried away. For some crazy reason, when the price comes back down, there is quite often a pattern where it falls exactly 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% of the way back to where the increase started. (EX: The uptrend stopped at $100, so it retraces 38.2% and the price ends at $62.80)";1;0;False;OhAndOneMoreThing;dqwdkrd;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

There's a difference between diversifying in general and redistributing your bitcoin assets. Your last sentence means you go from one asset to another, right?

Definitely not. If they want to buy a house that's not irresponsible. Also A house in most cases will be available a year from now, and almost certainly be worth more. Whereas with BTC, you could be in the hole 40% or up 100% incredible amounts of volatility, is not responsible. Why do you think people say, only put in as much as you're willing to lose, but don't say the same thing for a house?;1;0;False;kushari;dqww7c8;I sold all my bitcoins, and bought a house!;7i55ge;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i55ge/i_sold_all_my_bitcoins_and_bought_a_house/
"I would agree with cashing out and diversifying it. But this is buying a house outright with the proceeds of the bitcoin sale. Probably one of the smartest things you could do with the cash. You dont have to worry about paying rent or a mortgage any longer. Think of how much more you could save / invest in when you dont have to worry about paying $1k+ a month for your housing any longer? That extra $1k+ a month could take someone who may have been living pay check to pay check prior to being someone with a comfortable cushion of cash left each month to save, invest, splurge on a nice vacation, the list goes on. Even if the housing market crashes, its not like half of your house is going to disappear, you are still set with a roof over your head and not having to worry about your housing costs.

Quite frankly seeing the instability of exchanges like coinbase when things get volatile like the last weeks is really making me thing of pulling out what I have in bitcoin. I've made a pretty nice return on what I have had for awhile. Cause whenever the correction does happen just imagine how bad the exchanges will be then?

"Not right away! Put that $10 in betterment, then the next $10 in crypto, then $10 in gold, then $10 in savings. By the time you reach $1000 you‚Äôll have a portfolio where no more than 25% of your money is exposed to any one asset. 

And no one thinks that $10 is actually a savings. That‚Äôs what you should save each month. And if that‚Äôs all you can manage over years then you need to spend some time in /r/PersonalFinance

PS don‚Äôt take offense! I‚Äôm just trying to show that there are ways for the poor to save intelligently without too much risk. Also, someone with less money that wants to take the risk can easily weight their portfolio toward crypto. When you don‚Äôt have money the game is all about capital appreciation, and once you have it the game is about capital preservation. 

Three years ago I didn‚Äôt have any savings, a crushing amount of student debt, and a ton of credit card debt.

 guess what, shit sucks. If that's the only job you can do you have no choice. Find a way to get there. Biking isn't that bad. 50 miles a day is doable. Find a way to carpool. Find a way to move closer to the job. If you can't find affordable housing near your job, you're gonna have to make sacrifices. Take in more roommates then you would want to.

However, I would argue (like the article does) that most were never taught good habits with money and have no idea how to manage it intelligently.

Now, you could absolutely argue that the fact that most people don‚Äôt have a savings and live paycheck-to-paycheck is more of an indictment of the failures of our economic system than of individual spending habits, and that is absolutely true. People working minimum wage jobs should be able to make it in the western world, and build a future. (The bootstrap argument is absolutely bullshit).

However, you have to admit that spending a little time educating oneself on how to manage money is probably the best investment to make. We literally trade our time on this planet for money, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty worth while to figure out how to leverage it and make it work for you.

there are many other costs associated with owning your own home even if you don't have a mortgage.  Property taxes, home owners insurance, HOA fees, maintenance, etc. all cost money.  you shouldn't be buying a house without 20% down to avoid PMI and if you have that kind of liquid cash you are losing out on the opportunity cost to invest and buy bitcoin with that.  In addition, the transaction costs of buying/selling a home are huge, realtor fees, closing costs, eat into a lot of profit, especially if you aren't going to live in the same place for a long time.  Plus the interest you pay in the beginning of a loan is very high. This is also highly dependent on where you live- some places have high rents compared to the home values where it makes purchasing worth while.  ;2;1;False;iamedreed;dqweu61;I sold all my bitcoins, and bought a house!;7i55ge;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i55ge/i_sold_all_my_bitcoins_and_bought_a_house/
If you can rent more cheaply than buying, it's better to rent and save while moving isn't _too_ big of an inconvenience, I think. A main advantage of buying is price stability relative to changes in housing prices.

"Most stories with houses on r/bitcoin are other way around, people selling houses in order to buy BTC.

It sucks that people have to change back to fiat in order to buy a house. Looking forward to times it would be possible to buy a house with BTC directly.

Anyway, I still think Bitcoin will cros your path soon.

"Well done and absolutely the right thing to do when it comes to buying first home.

Owning a property (especially the land it is built on) will always have a value. The population on the planet is going up while the amount of land is not.

Not matter of whether digital or fiat currency gets on top in the future, that property will have a good value in whatever the currency is at that moment.

On top of that owning a property probably means saving from rent, and you can always invest back into crypto :) ";2;0;False;zuzko;dqwl8cw;I sold all my bitcoins, and bought a house!;7i55ge;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i55ge/i_sold_all_my_bitcoins_and_bought_a_house/

Can't really argue how someone else feels, but ok.

>If a business didnt own it's .com domain, it would really struggle. Just imagine if the .com was actually a site which guided newbies into how to buy, store, use Bitcoin, and explained everything neautrally with no bias.

You mean...kinda like Bitcoin.com does? Even if you go up top and select BCH/USD it takes you to a page that mentions...dun dun dun...how to buy, store, and use Bitcoin.

>Would be massive for adoption

Kinda like how when you search for ""Buy bitcoin with credit card"" or similar Bitcoin.com comes up and you can buy Bitcoin pretty easily?

That's why I asked if it was sarcasm.

I was one of those transactions. On the anonymous twitter account https://twitter.com/Tether_is_Fiat, the donor (she), asked for us to send to her address in order to be involved in some sort of gift giving. This was the result.

Anyway even if he strictly adheres to using the donated money for the good of Bitcoin community like he says, it means he can go to many more countries, stay longer, maybe even take his loved ones alongside even, do more, talk more, do it without staying away from family, which in turn allows him to work even more (so technically paying for his family's trip would count as him spreading the word)

Couldn't believe that he wasn't doing well financially...but I suppose most of his BTC is in cold storage, locked away (from what he's spoken about).

"Without Andreas, I would never have gotten into Bitcoin. His incredible depth of knowledge is why I became a strong believer in this emerging technology. Like him, I had to sell and struggled to hold most of my coins due to rent and debt. But, I still held onto a small amount, believing in the technology. And I watched his videos all the time, which encouraged me to hold what I could.

I too felt sick when I saw that tweet. And I was thinking about what Roger said, and how it applied to me as well. If I had more wealth, I would have bought more Bitcoin. If I didn't have a family and rent and bills, I would have kept more of it. But life is life. And shit happens. That tweet made me feel sick. It made me feel as if Roger was talking about me. It made me feel as if this childish and insecure man would never consider me an equal because I am not a millionaire. Where at one time I considered holding onto 1BCH to hedge my bets in this game, after reading that tweet, I sold it all. I will never ever touch anything that man does or agrees with. I don't care if, in some insane world, BCH becomes worth billions, and BTC worth 0. I will never look back at this moment with regret. Because I can not support anything this cold-hearted man supports.

"A bitcoin 1-address is the base58-representation of the hash of a public key. The public key is the result of EC point multiplication of the private key. This means that you have a chain of operations where you put in a private key in one end and get an address in the other end. The private key is just a 256-bit random value.

To make a vanity address like that, you brute force it. You pick a random value as a private key, puts it through the chain of operations, check if the resulting address matches the pattern you're looking for, then repeat until you've got a match.

Each letter in a base58 representation is one possibility out of 58, and that address has seven letters in the pattern. This means that on average one out of 58^7 addresses, i.e. one out of about 2.2 trillion, will start with that pattern.
