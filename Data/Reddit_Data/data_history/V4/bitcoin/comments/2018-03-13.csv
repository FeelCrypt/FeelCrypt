It's a common mistake, e.g., applying Warren Buffet rules to startup investing. It's an entirely different game. When the whole Apple is worth $8000 (it doesn't matter if OP is correct, it's just an example), it's mostly an investment in people. Buffet invests much later when there is much more information on the market. Not all investments work the same.

"If there is no option to sell, then you lose. As long as *someone* is willing to offer money and you sell to them you lose because you now have no chance at ever making your money back (unless of course you buy back in cheaper or the same price again). But what you are allowing is a chance to **lose** an opportunity.

It's really not that hard to understand what that saying means.

"Dude, get another account.

I just went through your post history... wow.

If you've got the money you say you do, for the love of god, cash out 25% and spend it on something you love. If you're under 18, get a limo and take a girl to the movies or someshit, if you're over 18, buy a lotus Elise and take it to the track. If you're over 21 - find some hot chick and spend that money at the bar/on a boat/in a private jet - whatever it takes to get laid.

Seriously, nobody on reddit cares what you made on crypto, and you're not winning any friends here claiming that wealth. We're putting your success down to _luck_, not _skill_.

Your post is an excellent example - anyone who's invested for more than 5 minutes knows you wouldn't have sold in 1980 then bought back during the whole iPod thing, because those peaks are only obvious in hindsight.

If I owned crypto in 2017, I would've sold on December 17... Oh wait, I did, and I didn't, because the peaks are only obvious after the fact.

"Its a zero sum game.

Say he bought it for 500 and sells for 1000.  The new person bought for 1000.  If it drops to 500, and he sells its a 500 dollar loss. He funded the profits of the last owner.

If it goes up from 1000 to 2000 and he sells, he makes 1000, and the new owner has it for 2000.  If it drops to 500, the new owner loses the 1500, he pays for it.

Eventually bitcoin will fail and drop back to zero, the person holding the bag loses all the money.

The only way someone doesn't eat the losses if it always goes up forever. That just isn't going to happen.  It will fall back to zero eventually.  Bitcoin has no underlying value to create a floor price.  Something better will eventually displace it.

Stocks technically have a floor price, they can only get so cheap before someone wants to buy up stock to buy the company.  Because stocks are tied to ownership.  Bitcoin doesn't have that.

"The end game for a company is bankruptcy with the company being worth nothing, thus the stock would be worth nothing.

You could try to say there is a floor because stock can only drop so low before a company gets acquired, but there are no guarantees anyone wants to buy up a company.  The ownership from stock therefore doesn't create a reliable floor price for the stock.

In the end, a stock will eventually collapse to zero, the question is how long will that take?  10 years, 100 years, 1000 years?  Someone is going to eat the loss when the company fails.

"That's true I'm general economic theory, not true in the question of a single commodity, such as Bitcoin.  Every Bitcoin you buy that later goes up, means the person who sold it missed out on those gains.  

I guess if you want to get complicated enough, you have to see what else that money could do for a person, so both can win.  Example, someone might need cancer treatment, so selling their Bitcoin to pay for it, even if that Bitcoin later goes up, was still a net gain for the seller.

"Buying or owning crypto is NOT specializing, as you do not have skills to solve a problem. If you study crypto and learn how it works, you'll specialize in cryptography with currency application. THAT may be something worth having, but not simply owning it.

A lot of the misconceptions with crypto is that y'all are gonna be super rich for simply investing some money into the crypto... and you might if you're lucky, but you won't be marketable. No one is going to hire you for a task or job at a high pay (or even any pay) because you followed a tutorial online for how to secure 5 different cryptos. You might find yourself in high demand if you can differentiate each crypto, help a company decide on which ones to use, help establish a system that works for the company, or educate staff on the cryptos.

"Not really, Bitcoin is zero sum with other currencies like USD, but it's theoretically possible for everyone that ever bought or sold Bitcoin to have done so at a profit if the price never declines (which is obviously not the case). The loss in this situation would be with holders of USD and other fiat currencies, but the Bitcoin market is so small you do not feel the USD or other currencies declining when Bitcoin gains, at least not yet.   

You also shouldn't be counting opportunity cost (or loss of potential gains), since that's a neverending game of ""what if"". There are an infinite amount of opportunities that would have net you more than even a 1000% gain in Bitcoin, in which case you could say everyone ""lost"" compared to the guy that shorted and went long at the exact perfect inflection points every time and netted 5000000%.";2;0;False;Vagrant_Charlatan;dvmqsmw;If anyone is having a bad day with crypto's market, Remember that today in 1976 Roland Wayne sold his 10% stake in APPLE for $800.

Apples and oranges.  Read up on Ronald Wayne.  He started a business, I think designing pinball machines, that went bad and was approached by two hippies to help design their computer case.  He was also much older then them and they worked at a breakneck speed.  Plus the way the contract was written, his personal property would be used as collateral in case the business failed.  So with the recent memory of his failed business, with two crazy hippies who wanted to start a business building something no one heard before, he decided to sell his shares.

This post is such bullshit. It's risk vs reward. The guy already had a business that failed and if Apple failed the loans Jobs took out would have had to all be paid by him since Jobs and Woz had no assets. His total compensation in today's time for his exit was $10k. He wasn't willing to take the risk which is totally fine. It's up to YOU and only YOU too decide if anything you do is worth the risks involved.

Nothing. He was just a co-founder with Jobs and Wozniak. He could've just let it sit until at least 1980 when the company first went public, when the stock would've been worth $212M. That's when I would've sold. Bought back during the whole iPod thing. I didn't start investing in companies until around 2012. When the iPhone 6 was announced, I bought 100 shares at $420 each, this was before the split. They're worth about $126,700 total according to my Merrill Lynch portfolio right now. Not to mention the dividends I've been receiving over the years from them. Solid company. I also bought Nvidia 100 shares at $13 a share around the same time. That's only worth $25,000 right now, but it pays an OK dividend.

Yeah, but what you don't see (or maybe you do) is that many people have very short time horizons. Comparing a stock to a coin would kill some people.

"I've been in managed futures for years.  Crypto is an entirely different game.
