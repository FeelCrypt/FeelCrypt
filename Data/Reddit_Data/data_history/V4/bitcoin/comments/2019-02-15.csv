\- he has lots of bitcoin we can steal... so let's ensure case stacked so high he bends over and shits coins

"The in either case point was for the specific group of criminals I was just talking about not all criminals. Nowhere did I imply all criminals. I brought them up specifically to highlight that reconditioning isn’t always possible.

The pattern of previously mild mannered individual getting arrested for assault shortly after head trauma to the forehead can’t be explained by bad upbringing. Neither can identical twin studies where the twins are brought up in separate environments but have similar issues or adopted kids going down extremely different live paths than their adoptive siblings despite similar upbringings or brain tumors leading to drastic changes in personality or many forms of birth defects affecting brain development. None of that means environment isn’t important. There are just times where a good environment isn’t enough. 

Not here to decide proper punishment but locking someone in jail and releasing them without any rehabilitation isn’t solving anything. Of course certain groups are affected by jail but many are not (i.e the hot-blooded criminals not capable of controlling themselves or those unable to learn from punishment). And yes there are treatments that can help some but you can’t teach empathy to a sociopath with an underdeveloped limbic system. They don’t have the machinery for it and we don’t have the understanding to build it for them.

If it were binary there wouldn’t be ethical issues you’d just fix whats broken and leave what’s not. I fail to see how you could have interpreted my statements to suggest a binary situation when I specifically ask questions about “how much do you fix” and “who do you fix” if it were binary those are trivial questions.

"Bitcoin is partly about currency competition. The idea here is to have an alternative to  government controlled currency, which is free speech and mathematically pre-determined in terms of issuance.

Stablecoins on something like Lightning Network could enable mass adoption to those still believing in government controlled fiat currencies they grew up with. The underlying is still rubbish fiat but easily swapped out by Bitcoin if confidence in fiat currencies crumbles.

Obviously it'd better not be permissioned ""JPM Coin"" but something less so like DAI, which is a USD derivative collateralized against the USD exchange value of ETH.
