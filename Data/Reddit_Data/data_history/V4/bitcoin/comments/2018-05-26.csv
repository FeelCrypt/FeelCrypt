"Housekeeping:

My apologies for not knowing the Reddit Rules as the TOS for this thread isn't easily seen using the app, and I'm brand new to Reddit as a n00b -- but not at all new to art let alone cryptocurrency (as an artist the cliche stands, I'm dirt poor lol despite knowing of BTC but I'm well on my path out of poverty after I heal from my upcoming surgery).

Anyway, I have received a gift to save my life. So I removed my unruley comment(s) as I have no need to negotiate terms of splitting the reward. Instead I will soon sometime on Sunday and/or Monday be putting together a post of all the clues/ideas I have for everyone here (despite this down voting attitude towards me as a Reddit n00b) so someone may solve the puzzle faster. All I ask is if my clues/ideas lead to the treasure that after the winnings are claimed by whom solves it all, to please post the answer in full to the puzzle so I and others may know if I was at all onto something about the path I chose to take in solving it -- but the math and programing are surely beyond me but my curiosity will not die lol.

A taste of some clues I will be bringing to the table soon:

In other comments, as well as in private, I have stated that I think the pairing of the z's and q's are either pertaining to the mining of blocks on a valid chain vs an attack chain but one would have to know how to run this algorithm or do the math to get this part of the answer. The other thing this maybe is the pairing of the z's and q's may have to do with the pairing of doubling the HashCash SHA function, as BitCoin hashes it twice over to make up for the future of the encryption weakening. To find this one would have to know how to run the HashCash function that BitCoin uses or know the encryption math behind it to obtain this. These are the two ideas of the z's and q's pairing which correspond to the formula missing in the graphic as a glyph where a Sigma would be at (the funny looking ""E"" found in the White Paper math formula). The upside down ""y"" is a math symbol too and it too is a clue as it is the unknown that lays after the infinity symbol, ""to infinity and beyond"" -- Buzz Lightyear in Pixar's Toy Story. Plus, I think there is a total of 3 steps to solving the original puzzle prior to OP removing the last step for us all. I think that only based upon the pairing clue in the image itself of, ""3"" and ""way"". Also, I think the circle is what is standing in as infinity and the answer from the z's and q's, or some other form of a pointer, will possibly give reference points upon the infinite spots plotted within the raster pixels of the circle; hence the Pixar reference quote as a clue (Pixar aka Pixels).

I could totally be looking way too much into this and be completely wrong, as I have no ability to check my hunches as I lack Blockchain programing skills and math skills.";-4;0;False;AmirisJBrown;dzlz184;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

"Wait, this person that sent the bitcoin to the address may be onto something. One of the clues is

>""To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.""

You get this from a [comment that op deleted](https://www.removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/_/dz8slgv/).

We know there is an infinity symbol in here and an X inside a box. The X is already of **much** significance as it is THE ONLY thing in the entire image that overlaps anything and the thing it happens to overlap is the number 257, that text also happens to be the only thing, that I could find, that has some colouring that is off. There is an orange tinge to the bottom of the characters.

So here's the thing, if we draw a line from the infinity symbol to the X we get this: https://i.imgur.com/dXhtv58.jpg

Notice the key words that are in the line: ""Provide, fast, cash""

Now granted it is a long shot, but perhaps sending the address bitcoin would be noticed by a bot and then some bitcoin will be sent back to the address that sent it.

I don't fancy throwing cash at this to see what happens since I don't have the spare capital to do so. But this does seem to be a fairly logical solution that isn't 100% a shot in the dark and also could have been one of the consolation prizes that op was talking about.

If this is one of the consolation prizes that op was talking about it looks like the person that sent the bitcoin to the address may have missed out because looking at the address it appears to be an exchange, not a personal address.

Since this seems to be a thing we are doing: If this does help you out and you're feeling generous remember me :)";2;0;False;dragonheart000;dzmbimr;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

 The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by \+1, and the failure event is the attacker’s chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by \-1. ;3;1;False;Kejno;dzlqn8c;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"YES!!!! THIS. The z's and q's and some P's along with the Sigma part of the equation is all for dealing out the mining algorithm, and to run it in code it is coded ""easily"" (aka ""code easily"" was a clue) instead of the long way there is a code technique short cut used to find this sequence. Then from this answer I believe there are pointers to the next answer. I think there are 3 steps to unlocking the code by the hint within the puzzle where it says ""way"" and ""3"" so I assume maybe there are three layers to unlock and doing the mining attack chain block sequence is one of the steps to getting possibly the ordering of the phrase needed for the wallet key.

* Spam/troll af

* Claim that the puzzle was solved, despite the fact that op in his comments explicitly wrote that changed addresses and emptied the initial address
* Therefore, they don't even check op's comment's and clues. That's another sign of them being lazy to even research basic things. It makes me wanna stop reading this comment box.

"Latest work on the graphic if it's helpful:

[https://github.com/stoneArcher/btcpuzzle\-misc](https://github.com/stoneArcher/btcpuzzle-misc)

When this graphic was made, the settings for the rendition of angles for all words resulted in total of 5 distinct angles all the words sit on.

The attached shows guides inside the circle for each of the five angles set in the graphic, and bip39 words circled in corresponding color of each guide \(line\).

Colors of red, orange, yellow, green and blue are set to rotations of \-60, \-30, 0, \+30 and \+60 degrees respectively.

The reason only small words are circled: all clues containing mnemonic words refer to the small words, and they are more manipulatable than the larger words if by chance, however likely or not, they are moved.

Number of words for each color guide is shown in legend, bottom right of graphic.

Miscellaneous notes:

\*\*Discovered that the word 'main' just above 'split' belongs to green group, so green has total of 6 words instead of 5.

Total of words in all color groups is 38.

Total of 25 small words outside of circle.

Words that hang partially outside the logo's circle were not counted in legend or in the total of 25 outside circle.

unalig \(purple\) = 'unaligned', which likely can be disregarded. A small number of words appear to not align with any of the 5 angles but on closer examination this doesn't appear to be the case.

Maybe coincidence, but one word for each color group evenly \(or nearly evenly\) dissects the circle.";6;4;False;stone_Archer;dzl1l4r;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png
