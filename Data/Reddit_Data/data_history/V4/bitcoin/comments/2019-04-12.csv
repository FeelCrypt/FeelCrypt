"To be fair, this disgusting thread was brigaded by /r/MGTOW and Redditors tend to be passionate about their hate of diamonds on engagement rings.

I can understand thinking that it's ridiculous to exchange bitcoins (an exciting asset with potential) for an expensive engagement ring (which evokes ideas of materialism and excess) with a diamond (an asset that loses a significant portion of its value immediately, that warrants concerns over ethics, that originates from a market in a situation of oligopoly).

"He doesn't have any anymore though.

It's difficult to come up with a reasonable percentage. There are so many factors to take into account.

In my case, cryptocurrencies represent approximately a fourth of my assets, which is too much, but that's because I started buying in 2012, because I expect a recession, because I believe in crypto and because I don't have to worry about my pension.

At this point in time, I think that people should have at least 15% divided between precious metals and cryptocurrencies.";3;0;False;Exotemporal;ekokkl6;Me when I bought $4 of bitcoin at $4,000 and then sold it when it got to $5,000;bc3hk1;https://imgur.com/wKZCvcn

The reply in which you addressed a similar comment was at the bottom of the thread, I saw it after I posted my comment. My question was answered when I read that you don't have too much disposable income and that the $4 were just what was left over in your balance after investing in the stock market.

">I think that cryptocurrencies belong in every portfolio because of their potential and in the interest of diversification.

I totally agree. However, in my situation right now I probably shouldn't be investing at all tbh lol. Up until recently I was living paycheck to paycheck. But I've been doing a bit better now and I really like investing so I decided to do a little bit. I will certainly be buying more crypto at some point, but in my current situation I need to play things safe. I'm about to start a high paying job so hopefully soon!

Why didn't you spend more than $4 to make it count? I'd put $500 or $1,000 at the very least to make it worth my time and more exciting. Turning $400 into $498 would have been satisfying, don't you think? You could even take the initial investment back at some point and use the remaining capital as play money.;-6;2;False;Exotemporal;eko671l;Me when I bought $4 of bitcoin at $4,000 and then sold it when it got to $5,000;bc3hk1;https://imgur.com/wKZCvcn

If I were in your shoes and if you believe in bitcoin as much as I do, I'd make that my absolute priority. I witnessed the price of a bitcoin go from 4.5â‚¬ to 14,000â‚¬. That was over 3000â‚¬ for each euro I spent in 2012. If I didn't have any today, I wouldn't spend a single euro buying something I don't truly need. All of my disposable money would be spent on bitcoin. No video game, weed, new iPhone or whatever young people like to buy.;5;0;False;Exotemporal;ekoumd2;Me when I bought $4 of bitcoin at $4,000 and then sold it when it got to $5,000;bc3hk1;https://imgur.com/wKZCvcn
