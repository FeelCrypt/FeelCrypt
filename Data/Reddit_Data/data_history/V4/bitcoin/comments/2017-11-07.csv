"**Market manipulation**

Market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency. Many forms of market manipulation are prohibited in most countries, in particular, it is prohibited in the United States under Section 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in Australia under Section 1041A of the Corporations Act 2001, and in Israel under Section 54(a) of the securities act of 1968. The Act defines market manipulation as transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradeable security. Market manipulation is also prohibited for wholesale electricity markets under Section 222 of the Federal Power Act and wholesale natural gas markets under Section 4A of the Natural Gas Act.

"Agreed, trade volume is just one measure that is used by savvy traders. 

The situation you are describing is part of a few market manipulation techniques:

Namely “wash trades” and “churning”.  Both are designed to increase prices through increased confidence in the market.

"That's the nature of high-risk ventures. They're for people who want to get get *really* rich and are willing to tolerate uncertainty and potential disaster.

Everything else you listed is for people like me, who are okay with small, incremental gains and a modest lifestyle. Sure I might be richer if I dump my networth into magic internet money, but I won't be *safer*, and I certainly won't feel safer.

"You realize that they pay for tons of people at the company to travel correct? Like engineers, finance, HR, all of these people have corporate credit cards and receive per deim on business trips, as well as hotel and airfare.  At the companies I've worked for engineers and field service workers incur WAY more travel and expenses than our CEO and CFO do in a given year, I think you have a very negative view of corporations for some reason, and yes it's your choice to get out of them if you'd like, I guess if you're currently working for a corporation my question would be why? I would suspect it's because even with all of your complaints they pay more and offer more benefits than a ma and pa company and more than you would make starting your own business.  Now I'm not saying there isn't wasted money, there is at every company.  For example at a previous company of mine I worked in the tax dept and because California is going broke, if you need a tax refund from a city bye to overpayment or double payment mistakes, it will trigger a county and state audit automatically and they drag it out for 5+ years, where my company has literally been owed $1.8M and due to the added costs of the audit process refused to go after the refund because of the expenses they would incur for the near decade it would take to get their tax refund, so they write it off as a loss (wasted money).  A lot of executives are meeting with political officials and lobbying them to gain more business, it's all part of the game.  If politicians weren't corrupt there wouldn't be a reason to travel to see them.  Most companies have a ""lobbying fund"" and at my current company all managers and executives are required to contribute 10% of their pay to the company lobbying fund.  I know there are ALOT of corporate haters out there, and I understand since you hear mainly the negative side of things but until you've been in meetings with the CEO and CFO of major companies and understood the decisions they have to make and how those decisions impact the lives of over 100,000 people because if the company goes under so do those jobs, the stress they face,  the sacrifice they make to be away from their families because they're on call 24/7 and work 18+ hours a day 365 days a year sometimes just sleeping in their offices for an hour or two and back to grinding, it's not as glamorous a life as you think. So yeah, they earn the first class seat and a nice dinner, and some good pay.  They have way more to manage and their decisions are way more impactful to way more people than your job and mine, unless you're the CEO of a company at which case you know what I'm talking about.

"Uh... I mean, in the sense that asset transactions, storage and records take place on the blockchain then yeah, but the world isn't going to stop using non-blockchain-based assets. Stocks didn't end up in the museum when people stopped using actual stock tickers; they just went digital. The same could very well happen with blockchain technology like it did with computers and the internet, I agree. If every company has its own personal token, which has value dependent on the value of the company and can be exchanged for some universal supercurrency, then that's effectively the same thing as stock.

Not to mention that wouldn't even work, the capital costs to mine an asteroid would be enormous.

"These bans are more enforced by _fear_ than actual force.

Life for most people in the 1930s was very hard indeed (by today's standards that is), and amidst an economic depression, people seemed, understandably really, to desire _security_ above all else, and were even willing to submit to a form of fascism in the hope of attaining it. It would have been easy in 1933 to say ""you're doing the right thing for your country to give up your gold"", and many would probably happily have complied without the need for enforcement. Also, AIUI, the law did not apply to small holders, those with under 100 USD worth of gold/silver (about five troy ounces of gold).

">But I also know that the supply is controlled and there's no guarantee the dollar won't be worth significantly less in the near future either. After all, it has lost 97% of its buying power in just over 100 years.

That's a couple of percent inflation a year. 

That's much more tolerable in a currency than rapid deflation.

In the great depression there was a 35% contraction in the money supply, and it helped to collapse not only the banking system but the entire economy. The value of the dollar started rising and so no one wanted to spend it, everyone wanted to wait until it was more valuable. Sound familiar?

Slight inflation is useful for a currency because it encourages people to spend it instead of hoarding it waiting for it to go up in value. It's not useful to the economy for someone to hold onto money for 100 years and not spend it.

If you want to store money invest it in something. Money in itself has no value except as a medium of exchange.

>You seem to mistake the end goal here. It is not to transfer back into fiat. It is to replace fiat

Why do people keep telling me then that bitcoin is not meant to be a currency but a store of value like gold?

There's a finite limit of 21 million coins. That's not a fundamental property of the universe, its the number Satoshi happened to put in his code. That's artificial scarcity. The limit could have been set to 21 trillion coins or infinite coins if they wanted to.

That applies to every other cryptocoin. The difference is there aren't a bunch of people who believe that a dogecoin is going to be worth 10 million dollars in the near future so no one is interested in speculating on them.

I own no gold but I do own bitcoin and other alts so I'm all for blockchain technology. But I'm also a geologist so in know some stuff about gold. It actually is more special than some metals in terms of currency and as a holder of value. Historically it was an easy metal to mint because it's so malleable, it's doesn't rust unlike many other metals, it was relatively easy to find, not so much anymore, it looks good to wear, it's dense enough that it could easily be distinguished from fake gold coins. In the modern day most of its utility is in electronics and historical precedent.

"Cognitive dissonance from speculators.

Before speculation hit fever pitch, there was a lot more hope that bitcoin could actually see widespread adoption as a currency. This is why people though it could become so valuable.

However recent price growth has been completely divorced from its acceptance as a currency. People who now have thousands of dollars invested in bitcoin have strong interests not to accept the fact that bitcoin is failing to be adopted as a currency.

so either they can accept that they've all bought into something that isn't actually going to work, or find another reason why its worth the thousands of dollars. hence the seamless transition to the ""store of value"" narrative.

You often hear people say ""its the new gold!"", even though it was never meant to be used like gold. It also ignores that most of the demand for gold comes from jewelry, and that the speculative bubble in gold burst 7 years ago and still hasn't recovered, which makes gold a rather poor ""store of value"" if you bought it 7 years ago.";1;0;False;suninabox;dphnxs1;‘Buy Bitcoin’ Overtakes ‘Buy Gold’ as Online Search Phrase;7bcd90;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/bitcoin-rally-is-eroding-gold-s-appeal-top-online-vaulter-says

Again, like gold, the vast majority of demand comes from jewelry. It's not valuable because its a ""store of value"", its valuable because people like to wear it.

People don't want substitute diamond or substitute gold jewelry, if they did the price of diamond and gold would both collapse. A cartel to keep diamonds artificially scarce only matters so long as people still want to wear natural diamonds as jewelry instead of artificial diamonds.

Gold and diamond jewelry are both status symbols which means you can't substitute just with something that looks similar.

The demand for bitcoin comes from an entirely different source. 95%+ is from speculators. As soon as bitcoin stops delivering speculative gains that demand will disappear.

">Is gold more intrinsically valuable than iron? How about copper? Platinum? They're all metals, why is gold such a much better store of value than the others?

Most of the demand for gold comes from jewelry. If people stopped giving a fuck about wearing gold there'd be a massive drop in the price of gold.

Gold became a store of value because its relatively dense, it doesn't rust, its soft and easy to work into jewelry and strike into coins, you can beat it into leaf, its easy to make into alloys if you need to make it harder, its chemistry means its was easy to find in relatively pure chunks which minimized the need for advanced mining or ore processing. It's rare enough to be hard to find but common enough to establish markets for it everywhere. It's hard to fake and relatively easy to test purity.

few of those apply to other metals and none applied to all at the same time for most of human history.

It was never ""people arbitrarily decided gold was more valuable than all other metals"". It never began as a speculative asset. People started speculating on it later, and after the last crash in speculation it has returned to a more reasonable and stable price. There is no magic to golds value.

95%+ of the demand from bitcoin comes from speculation. It's incredibly unbalanced compared to gold.

">I definitely concede that jewlry is part of the demand for gold, but my guess is that its valuable primarily because of its historical value and its social context

Yeah, jewelry is a status symbol, its demand doesn't come from raw scarcity or utility. The fact that kings and queens have used gold for thousands of years has gold deeply ingrained in almost every culture on earth as a status symbol.

platinum is far rarer than gold, but there is very low demand for platinum wedding rings, because scarcity alone doesn't confer status.

>The unspoken assessment, at least beased on your comment, is that you think that bitcoin is valueless

Not so. I said 95% of the value comes from speculation. Massively over-valued doesn't mean its worthless. However the level of speculation and price volatility is preventing it from being used as a currency. No one wants to spend bitcoin when they're convinced holding it is going to make them a millionaire. The speculators mentality is deeply ingrained in the culture now, which is why you see so many posts about ""thank you bitcoin for making me a millionaire"" and ""10 million a coin here we come!"", and very few posts about actually using the currency.

Although bitcoin was the first coin to market, and the current market leader, it will almost certainly be overtaken by another more stable and useful coin.

Deflationary currencies are a terrible idea for the above reasons, and for the same reason gold ceased to be a useful currency. No one wants to spend a currency that is more profitable to hoard. Inflationary currencies work well because the incentive is to spend it rather than to hoard it. Currency is only a token of wealth, there is nothing productive in hoarding it. If a currency isn't changing hands its useless.

>It is a borderless currency available anywhere the internet is available which is pretty much anywhere. This can't be said of any other currency. That is a profoundly valuable quality.

That's exactly my point. There is an *absolutely fixed supply*. When the value of the currency increases, we simply expect prices to decrease. This isn't an issue in bitcoin, because we can very easily subdivide, and get a smaller portion of the overall value. ***You are the one who says that deflation is an issue here***.

 You are very clearly confused here. If I have 1 slice out of a pie, with 100 slices, if the pie grows, my portion grows as well. But if I can't divide my slice further, then we have an issue in how we pay people to keep an economy growing. If I can divide my slices further, then who cares if my 1 slice gets absolutely massive?

I'm saying no investment reliably does 50% in 3 months is my point. It's luck of being on the right side of volatility.

A hedge fund that does 10% a year is doing twice as well as the average hedge fund.

The S&P 500 did an average of 9.8% a year for the last 90 years and that's better than almost any other investment.

If you think 50% in 3 months is a realistically achievable figure you should be running a hedge fund. Else its luck of buying in at the right time.

You can do 100% in 10 seconds at a roulette wheel in a casino but its impossible to reliably do it, just like its impossible to reliably predict the market.

"Yea I get what your saying too about perception of value vs. actual intrinsic value. I would argue though the the main intrinsic value of gold, in the past, was it's *use* as a currency and store of value. From the point of a historical civilization without modern technology, gold is easy to obtain en mass, can be imprinted with a seal or a mark easily, doesn't rust and disappear, is easily distinguishable from fakes, and can be physically broken into smaller increments (to an extent). And is not ugly to boot.  This is actually pretty unique in terms of metals. Silver come close but it stains easily, copper is more malleable and easier to find but rusts heavily, iron rusts heavily and isn't malleable, platinum is hard to find. Jade was used by some civilizations but in the end is a mineral and much to hard to mark easily. It also chipped and lost value. So in the end gold is chosen because it's intrinsically the best choice to store and transfer value (I would also argue that the value ascribed to jobs and material is more of the perception part, and gold was chosen to store that value).

However, nowadays the intrinsic value of gold is probably just its historical significance and perception like you said, or if it's not then it's heading that way, and we just can't let go and change. Mainly because we had no device to challenge gold with. Bitcoin is challenging gold now and I could possibly see gold being less of a store of value and more of a technological component for electronics in the future, like platinum or copper is today.";1;1;False;WormLivesMatter;dphpmo9;‘Buy Bitcoin’ Overtakes ‘Buy Gold’ as Online Search Phrase;7bcd90;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/bitcoin-rally-is-eroding-gold-s-appeal-top-online-vaulter-says

"> 50% in 3 months is a lottery ticket in investment terms.

Getting 50% in 3 months on an investment is way, way, way easier than winning a significant amount of money with lottery ticket. That's not the point, anyway. My point is there are a lot of people who want to get rich buying altcoins because it's too late to make 10,000+% buying bitcoin. And I think it's silly to try to replicate the success of early bitcoin adopters. Those returns are unlikely to happen again in crypto. Those people who bought $1000+ of bitcoin when it was less than a dollar, and still have it, are rarer than people who've won the lottery. I'd rather stick with bitcoin because I have more realistic goals for my return.

Most of gold's value is only what people are willing to pay for it because its scarcity and for some reason we've decided it's valuable.

When prices get so low, we don't have the problem of literally running out of money like we did in the Great Depression. We simply drop down a decimal place and move on. Sound money without the possibility of a economy not having enough money to circulate. The decrease in money supply, was actually the rapid decrease in balance sheets and credit, which was artificially created value anyways. Talk about your circular argument theory.

Just because we define a mathematical set into discrete subdivisions of value doesn't mean anything is artificial. Please do explain how you fit *absolutely* more integers between 0 and 21M. If you aren't comfortable with the idea of a bitcoin, try 1 BTC = 1/21e4% of the overall valuation that we universally attribute to bitcoin.

> That applies to every other cryptocoin. The difference is there aren't a bunch of people who believe that a dogecoin is going to be worth 10 million dollars in the near future so no one is interested in speculating on them.

No the difference is that bitcoin was first, created with a serious goal in mind, and all the technological advancements are happening on bitcoin. Also, if I go to Nigeria, the changes of someone understanding ""bitcoin"" are much higher than someone understanding the phrase ""dogecoin"". Remember, demand gives something value. If someone is willing to exchange something of value to me for bitcoin, then you cannot logically tell me that it does't have value.

> I'm not sure what you think that I said that equates to ""absolutely every fiat currency in the world is valuable and always will be"".

Because every single fiat currency is based off the idea that it is valuable, because other people see at as valuable. So if you are using such an argument to discredit bitcoin, you are effectively dismissing all currencies. So does the USD have value or not? Because it runs on the exact same principals as bitcoin and the Venezuelan bolívar. You don't just get to pick and chose arbitrarily in a logical argument. The only difference between the 3 is that no one wants the bolivar because they don't trust it will have any value in the future... which is ""circular"" because that's what gives it its value.

"That is just a more complicated way of saying ""bitcoin is valuable because lots of people agree its valuable"", which is the circular logic that fuels all speculative bubbles.

Speculation can drive the price of any asset up. ""buy this thing because its going up in value and you'll get rich quick"". people buy the thing, which increases the value, which provides yet more proof this thing is a thing that increases in value, and even more people buy in.

the problem that always happens is when people are only buying something because it goes up in value, eventually you reach a point where the price is so high that amount of money flooding in can no longer keep increasing the price. Once the price stops increasing, the people who all only bought it because it was increasing in value start selling it, which drops the value and then the same cycle of buying-price rises that put the value up starts taking the value doing with selling-price drops.

you need something out of that circular logic to provide sustainable value. which used to be ""bitcoin is a revolutionary new currency that allows you to trade without the need for centralized banks"", but since everyone is just speculation and not using it as a currency has become ""its a store of value!"", which doesn't work if its valuable only because of speculation and artificial scarcity.

>Hackers aren't locking computers up with ransomeware, expecting dogecoin in return.

Again this is circular logic. ""bitcoin is worth something because people want to steal it"", ""why do they want to steal it?"", ""because its worth something"".

"> That is just a more complicated way of saying ""bitcoin is valuable because lots of people agree its valuable"", which is the circular logic that fuels all speculative bubbles.

If demand is how you define a speculative bubble, then I have some bad news for you about every single world currency, and every inflation hedging asset like gold. The reason that piece of paper with a number on it, or better yet, that piece of plastic that links you to a database with numbers in it is worth anything, is the very fundamental concept that it is valuable because people believe it is valuable. Bitcoin is no different except for instead of having to use Visa or Wells Fargo to facilitate such transactions, we use a decentralized ledger that everyone has, and can individually verify the transaction. But to pretend like that piece of paper/money in your bank account have any value behind the trust that you can walk into a grocery store and buy chicken with it later, is foolish. ALL money is based off the idea that you can communicate the transfer of value, and that the recipient can later redeem that value for something else.

> Speculation can drive the price of any asset up. ""buy this thing because its going up in value and you'll get rich quick"". people buy the thing, which increases the value, which provides yet more proof this thing is a thing that increases in value, and even more people buy in.

Is bitcoin overbought and overhyped at the moment? Possibly. Possibly not. I for one believe there is at least *some* inherent value in something that we collectively decide there to be a finite amount of, with predictable supply, that is fairly easily transferable, and I can expect with relative certainty it will still be worth something tomorrow. After all, that's why fiat works. And bitcoin has been doing that pretty well for about 8 years now, so there's no real alarm to me that it will be worth nothing tomorrow. Significantly less? Sure. But I also know that the supply is controlled and there's no guarantee the dollar won't be worth significantly less in the near future either. After all, it has lost 97% of its buying power in just over 100 years. And when you compare it's features to other inflation hedge assets, its possible valuation is ridiculously cheap, so its entirely possible that it is simply reaching its fair market value from 0, one that if we consider it in relation to gold, would be upwards of hundreds of thousands, so its not exactly unreasonable to see it only get to <7% of that over a decade. A Bently goes from being worth $0 to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a very short period of time as well, but no one complains about that.

> the problem that always happens is when people are only buying something because it goes up in value, eventually you reach a point where the price is so high that amount of money flooding in can no longer keep increasing the price. Once the price stops increasing, the people who all only bought it because it was increasing in value start selling it, which drops the value and then the same cycle of buying-price rises that put the value up starts taking the value doing with selling-price drops.

You seem to mistake the end goal here. It is not to transfer back into fiat. It is to replace fiat. I have no intentions on selling for fiat. I intend on buying a big mac for 5000 satoshis once the price has reached it's fair market value. If it drops off sharply because it was overvalued and overbought as per the market's demand for it, sure I may sell some off, but only so that I can buy more at the bottom. This is how markets work. You buy things that are undervalued, and sell things that are overvalued.

> you need something out of that circular logic to provide sustainable value. which used to be ""bitcoin is a revolutionary new currency that allows you to trade without the need for centralized banks"", but since everyone is just speculation and not using it as a currency has become ""its a store of value!"", which doesn't work if its valuable only because of speculation and artificial scarcity.

So because people were wrong about it to begin with, it now has absolutely no value? Sure. Go ahead and tell that to the inventor of the microwave oven. And there is no ""artificial scarcity"". It is absolutely scarce. In the same way that 2+2 is absolutely 4.

> Again this is circular logic. ""bitcoin is worth something because people want to steal it"", ""why do they want to steal it?"", ""because its worth something"".

Again, if this is how you define something being worthless, I have some very, very bad news for you. Hackers want to steal it because they know with reasonably high certainty that they can then redeem that for other things of value. Just like how when you work for fiat, you know, with reasonably high certainty, that you can redeem that fiat for other things of value. If the dollar became worth half as much tomorrow, would you not want double your salary?

> A bunch of other coins have had big hacks. I picked dogecoin because its one of the least valuable coins based on the same math.

You seem to fundamentally misunderstand what gives bitcoin value. Bitcoin has value because you cannot send me bitcoin without first acquiring bitcoin. Period. End of story. So you cannot, logically tell me, that if I am selling my car for bitcoin, and only bitcoin, that it has no value. Because *I* am giving it value. There's at least a discrete amount of demand for bitcoin, in exchange for something that we both agree also has value. You can disagree, but the only way you are going to get my car is by giving me bitcoin for it. And the only way that you can do that is to first acquire bitcoin. And the only way that you can do that is by either begging for it, providing goods/services for it, or exchanging something else of value for it.

Right now, I think you would have a very tough time explaining to a Venezuelan that their fiat currency, a demand based currency just like the rest of them, has more value than bitcoin does. You can again, disagree with me, but the markets disagree with you.";2;1;False;Auwardamn;dpht626;‘Buy Bitcoin’ Overtakes ‘Buy Gold’ as Online Search Phrase;7bcd90;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/bitcoin-rally-is-eroding-gold-s-appeal-top-online-vaulter-says
"Is gold more intrinsically valuable than iron? How about copper? Platinum? They're all metals, why is gold such a much better store of value than the others?

"When I was 19, in June 2008, I bought gold and silver. I sold it in May 2011. I used GoldMoney. I had to wire my $8k to the Cayman Islands and they stored my gold in Switzerland. It was pretty stressful. My parents thought I was crazy, but I made like 50% on my gold and silver, cashing out with $12k. I only bought it because I was into Ron Paul at the time, and all the Libertarians were squawking about the market collapse, the gold standard, and whatnot. Now I'm a Bernie Sanders liberal, but I still see the value of Bitcoin.

When I bough Bitcoin, I was like, ""Hey, this is how it's done!"" So easy! Though my parents still think I'm crazy.

"You do know they made holding gold (and other pms) illegal not even that long ago right?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102

The government outright stole money from its citizens in broad daylight.  10 years in prison if you didn't turn in your precious metals for a standarized price.  The government then immediately turned around and sold those precious metals for nearly double the price they paid their own citizens to fill its piggybank.

You're really not safe in anything, unless you're an entity capable of jockeying for position with superpower governments.

"You know how easy it is to store a large value of gold?  One pound of gold is like 20,000 dollars.   

It's not that different from storing cryptokeys if you store it secretly and securely, in both cases you'll have to give away the key to your store of value for a bad actor to take it from you.   Even if you memorize the key itself (you'd have to be really trusting in your own memory, and really cautious of any kind of head trauma) and never wrote it down, that's still true.

Main difference, as a store of value, is the value of precious metals is much harder to undercut and has a multi-milennia track record, thus it's much more stable. 

The main problem with gold and other pms is they're taxed as ""collectibles"" at double the tax rate of capital gains (stocks and cryptos).   So if you ""profit"" because the petrodollar takes a dive and the value of your gold shoots to 50,000 per oz, even though it buys the same amount of beans and rice and other commodities, you're going to owe a massive amount of tax if you sell any of it for FIAT.";0;0;False;HPLoveshack;dphd8x7;‘Buy Bitcoin’ Overtakes ‘Buy Gold’ as Online Search Phrase;7bcd90;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/bitcoin-rally-is-eroding-gold-s-appeal-top-online-vaulter-says
