"Because people who don't know Bitcoin, think of it as a company. No one thinks of the USD as a company. Therefore if an ill informed person wants to know who's in charge of Bitcoin, or who Bitcoin's leader is, they'll likely search Bitcoin CEO.

Although the USD is not a company, the Federal Reserve certainly has leaders and people in charge that make decisions and control the USD and it's economy.

"This is a big question, so the full answer is never going to be simple.

In short: Bitcoin does not get updates without consensus.

You are possibly not asking about updates to Bitcoin, but rather about updates to the reference client, i.e. Bitcoin core. That one is being maintained by several people. However, everyone is free to implement their own client. If your own client follows the Bitcoin consensus rules, it will be part of the Bitcoin network. If not, it will split into an alt-coin.";2;0;False;OCPetrus;e7ftakd;"Upvote to get this to the top search result for ""Bitcoin CEO.""";9mggze;https://i.redd.it/h2dla06uozq11.png
