Other altcoins are currently dangerous investments. It is not really recommended. Tradening is possible but then you have to sit with your nose all day long.
You then have to keep the live price chart of btc-usd constand open on a screen. and the graph of an altcoin that you want to trade.
Wand the cheaper a coin, the greater the chance of even greater losses.

I think Monero is a pretty save investment right now. Because of the airdrop of moneroV and because this coin is in a higher price category. you do not have to deal with huge price fluctuations.

"I'm doing programmatic trades. I did it already with block.io/shapeshift but I'm looking for a wallet that offers more options than btc/ltc/dogecoin.

Though I could just use those main coins and trade those. I have to actually work on the analytics part that makes the decision to trade. Don't worry I'm dealing with the tiny ones eg. Dogecoin. Hence why I was looking for a different wallet that provided other alts like Voxels, Reddcoin, Potcoin, etc... (currencies under $1 each preferably $0.001 or so)

It's dumb, distraction, I'm not a math/trade guy so... it will more than likely lead to loss. But I'll hook it up to Twillio (probably not use Slack it's free) and get the notifications like ```trading_bot_002 made a trade of 200 reddcoin```

I‚Äôll be the last one there because I overslept and did too much too fast to prepare for the day, and the first one to start looking for signs of dismissal because just sitting and socializing and playing with the kids in my family can feel crushing sometimes. 

Chores to do? Let me do the dishes then sit down for 30 minutes before I fold the laundry.

">As I wrote, there are numerous studies showing that most women are simply not interested in STEM fields.

I never disputed that. Whether the studies are that there are less women interested than men or most are uninterested (as with the general pop), that seems reasonable. 

> I honestly don't think low number of women in IT has anything to do with discrimination

This is where we disagree. Historical discrimination most likely led to less women being involved in STEM and tech than otherwise would be, 100%. 

>In order to have ""positive"" discrimination, you have to discriminate someone ""negatively"". Why should be white men discriminated? Because they had the misfortune of being born to a white family? How is it different to discriminate black people?

I agree that things like affirmative action are problematic and cause many problems and that we should always strive for a meritocracy. However, they exist because of historical injustices they attempt to rewrite, which are very real. 

If you've beaten down a population, killed any educated ones, treated as 2nd class citizens, terrorized along racial lines, left in economically depressed neighbourhoods, it only makes sense to attempt to lift people out of that state and try and help them get on their feet with just a slight amount of assistance. The implementation is tricky but most agree something should be done. 

Economics shows us ways to distribute scarce resources, and so a dollar given to one area must be taken from another. If white people in the US have been so historically advantaged, it might make sense to redirect some resources to help those who have been disadvantaged, if only as a temporary measure. I'm not talking full on communist dictatorship, I'm talking like, more investment in education and neighbourhood programs. If Google wants to participate in such a scheme whereby they hire more minorities for whatever reason, it seems that along these restitutive lines that it would be acceptable. People are independent agents that are allowed to decide not to work for a company with certain policies they don't like. 

> 
But I would never force women to study STEM, just because there is too few women. That's a poor reason. 

No one said anything about forcing women to study STEM. That sounds crazy. All I'm saying is that less women being in STEM could 'stem' from past social injustices and that perhaps the # of women in STEM isn't accurately reflected by the 'natural inclination' % level of society. Google may feel that having more women and minorities with access to this world may spur more positive social change which is their company's goal (perhaps) and preogative. 

Forcing people to do anything is stupid, as is thinking women aren't suited for a job in tech.
