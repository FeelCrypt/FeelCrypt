do not go right in all but first buy 10% of your available money. if the value in btc drops by 20 to 30% you buy another 10 percent of your available money.

between 0.00015000 and 0.00024000 is best for a buy.

Mining profits have slipped over 40% in the last 8 weeks not so much due to Crypto prices going down, mostly due to mining difficulty increasing and also the ALT coin vs BTC price. I would do your homework and understand the mining return today which is a tad mediocre may be half two months from now. Most GPU' are already over one year return on investment which is usually seen as high risk due to the volatility of crypto, but as I say its getting worse so one year might turn to two years soon.;1;0;False;Battleneter;dvi8ra7;Who would imagine that mining cryptocurrencies and agriculture can work together?

I think its highly likely far less people will be buying into mining or expanding in the next few months at least, mining has been declining fast due to difficulty rates and ATL coin vs BTC price,  more than the actual price of BTC itself which is basically the  3rd downward pressure.;2;0;False;Battleneter;dvi7v62;Who would imagine that mining cryptocurrencies and agriculture can work together?

Basically at the moment when mining is less profitable due to power costs than straight out buying the coins directly is the point where its smart to turn off your mining rig just buy coins.

Biomass to Biogas is a thing but most biogas processes require 1-3 Joule per Joule of energy content. Starch and oil crops are popular for this. So the process is quite inefficient and will subsequently dont generate a meaningful return of energy.

Sorry, I realize I wasn't clear. I meant more, do we have a real timeline because people are starting to invest more time and energy into mining but seems to be on a downward trajectory in terms of reward to energy output ratio.
