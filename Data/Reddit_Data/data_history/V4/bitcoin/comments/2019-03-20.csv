"Bitcoin addresses have a checksum inside them. So would it be better if you split your address into 4 letters and write the letters yourself? 

Something like this:

    1KKF T9Q9 BWWM 
    FtrD nfKu aDp3 
    2CZQ 9Jd7 Fg

That way the letters will be written with your own handwriting which can't be replicated by a simple paint job or a QR code repaint.

Alternatively, you can write first 5-6 letters of your BTC address in your own handwriting, and signal people to verify with the QR code.";2;1;False;rattie_ok;eiz86kr;Yesterday I received 1 bitcoin on my street art QR codes donation adress!
