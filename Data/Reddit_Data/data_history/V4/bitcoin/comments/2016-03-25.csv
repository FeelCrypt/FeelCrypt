"Wasn't trying to publicly shame anyone. They didn't respond to any request for support for two days: Case file, live chat, twitter customer support, community forum. So I took it to the streets.

They get 1% of all of my transactions so that $58 dollars they earned from me receiving money into my account should at least be enough to give me a friggin response that hey we are working on it.

The end result is that it was a problem on their end and not anything that I did. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have noticed it until I decided that my $2490 dollars was a much bigger priority to me then it was to them and took action.

They reacted when someone probably brought attention to this thread and acted on the situation like they should have in the first place.

This community helped me out and you are right this does damage Coinbase because something as simple as an email to me could have avoided 810 other people upvoting this and thousands more reading this.

This is an important discussion for this form, he tried the normal support and they were unresponsive so he took the next step. Its vital for the community to communicate.

I think this is an important and valid point to make. I give Coinbase a certain amount of leeway taking into account that they are a startup navigating a very new space. I think that's fair. A lot of this leeway manifests in the trust I've extended by handing over a kidney's worth of personal info and a direct link to my bank account to an unproven young company with a small team. But this trust can only extend so far. When they as a company are not responding with the utmost promptness to missing funds from accounts, that's not acceptable no matter what size you are and how small your ""agile"" startup team is, and if they won't communicate quickly on an issue like this then customers should absolutely be taking it to the community in *every* case.  

If a company wants to offer bootstrap startup levels of customer service in response to thousands of missing dollars then being policed by the community it serves is the *least* that should be expected. Because that level of service in response to missing funds is unacceptable, and if they think otherwise, eventually they will lose their customers to a service that knows better.

"> As also usual, people make a public fuss about routine customer service issues that would have been solved quickly anyway.

I think the issue is that it was NOT being solved quickly, and when the issue involves money being siphoned directly out of your checking account, I think the quick response that never materialized was to be deserved. The response he received was *abysmal*.

I get that this is a new space and Coinbase as a startup is hitting the ground running, but that doesn't let them off the hook for slow, uncommunicative responses to *missing money*. The bar is higher. This isn't the same as wondering where the HDMI cable I ordered off Amazon is, and in any event, Amazon would do a better job of telling me immediately than Coinbase often does. 

I've been frustrated more than once by not only by material errors in their service, but the support that was offered in the wake of them.  

Edit: None of this is to say that Coinbase isn't generally a good service, because it is. Coincidentally, CB just sent me a survey asking how they were doing and would I recommend them, and my feedback was much the same as what I said here. I gave them a 7/10, and opined that while they were one of the best services out there, I feel that is because there simply is not a lot of competition, and their errors and support have been fairly noteworthy in how anemic they are in my exp. In general though, to be fair, it's at the top of the list of services in the space I'd recommend to a new user, but again that isn't saying as much as it could be. There is *substantial* room for improvement with Coinbase both on the product and service side.

"We do know the answer. If Coinbase were actually ignoring customer support issues we would be seeing complaints.

The complaints that we do see are usually very premature.

OP knows damn well that Coinbase would need to investigate what happened to his transaction and whether the problem was on their end or something to do with OP's bank.

">The important thing is that his issue is resolved now.

I don't think so at all. Having ""a lot of customers"" is no excuse to lagging or lacking in your Customer Support Department. In fact, this should cause you to have some of the best support you can offer as it should be an area of focus for them.

Very true.  Advice for coinbase users:  support is always unhelpful.  They will not do anything until you threaten to cancel your account or take legal action.
