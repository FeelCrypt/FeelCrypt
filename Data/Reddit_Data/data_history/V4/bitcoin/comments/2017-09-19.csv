"""Higher interest rates can negatively impact home sales, but prices move according to the relative supply and demand and have generally increased in declining sales markets...""

- Walter Molony (Economic Issues Media Manager at National Association of Realtors)


This pretty much describes what I mean for the most part. Hope that helps.

Please remember though I was just making a fun economic-type slippery slope of how the market might move if ""no one is spending"". Lol. But yes, in theory reduced spending could actually produce a *relative* increase in spending at the same time, but I would imagine the reduced spending in general would outweigh that increase. It would almost create a more gradual decline in consumerism than a fast crash because it semi-counterbalances itself.";2;0;False;TzucciMane;dn7wu6s;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
Who said he put all his retirement in it, that's quite the assumption unless I missed something? A lot of us love to get away from a dollar that's inflating like crazy, a government that keeps printing money and a federal reserve that supports useless wars.  It's smart to diversify and use traditional investments, but to completely ignore crypto currencies and the blockchain is pretty ignorant. What's the problem with someone loving something so instrumental in shaking up the norm and making a drawing about it, that's pretty ridiculous you're getting so bent out of shape because he drew something and loves it, kind of strange.   ;5;0;False;GenghisKhanSpermShot;dn6rycx;"My father has recently fallen in love with Bitcoin and has started painting Bitcoin art themes, I present to you his first: ""The Bitcoin Bull"" by Ludvig Manukyan.

"I got into trading futures while studying finance at UCLA, slowly learned the industry and currently trade contracts for everything from oil to coffee beans. Once you get over the initial learning curve it becomes very lucrative. 

All the talk of btc being so unpredictable is just a load of crap, it's one of the softest markets I've seen very emotionally driven. I'm able to trade in between ranges using nothing but price action, volume profile, and Fibonacci lines. I trade on up to 10% margin no stop loss, but my eyes never leave the screen when using leverage, average trade is usually just a couple hours. I have another account where I just dip buy, but the big money I've made is through trading between the ranges. If you know what your doing it's highly lucrative, I don't really care about bitcoin the tech I just live how volatile and exploitable this market is.

"What does ""FUD"" have to do with anything I said? I'm spreading FUD because I'm saying having a government with taxes that pay for services we use isn't a bad thing? Not everything you disagree with is FUD, lol.

Income tax nowadays is used for much more than wars to redistribute wealth. I'm not sure how its original purpose has anything to do with its current usefulness. The rich get taxed more than the poor, so you could say that income tax nowadays actually redistributes wealth from the economic elite to the masses.

The corporations will just pass on the tax to their workers by giving lower wages or charging higher prices... That wouldn't help the middle class. If the corporations charge higher prices, it would actually harm everyone who isn't rich, since the rich would be paying the same tax rates as the poor, since income level doesn't affect sales tax.

"FUD because ""make sure other people don't go about raping and pillaging everything, regulate companies to keep them from poisoning us or ripping us off.""  Get real kid. 

Also, I am aware of the theory of trickle down economics.  It is bullshit. The rich do not get taxed more than the middle class. I never once said they get taxed more than the poor.  There are huge corporations paying less than 10% and as low as 0% tax making billions of dollars.  Meanwhile, struggling Americans are paying  more than twice their rate.

“Last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4% of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33% to 41% and averaged 36%.” He added, “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.”  - Warren Buffett

"I mean, if there were no laws, there would be raping and pillaging going on. People would just take what they wanted. And yes, companies would poison us if the FDA didn't force them to do tons of trials on new drugs, and implement regulations about what can be in our food.  You think stuff like asbestos, leaded gasoline and paint, and the banned pesticides would've actually been voluntarily removed by companies unfettered by governmental regulation? ""Get real kid"".

As to ripping us off, the FTC, BBB, and the other consumer protection agencies are all that stands between us and companies just ripping us off with nothing that we can do about it. ""Sue them"", you say? Oh wait, who's paying the judges and enforcing any judgments? Hmmm... How about ""Competition will drive consumers to other companies!"" Except for all of the companies which have effective monopolies, as well as all the monopolies that would form with no FTC to prevent them.

And sure, taxation loopholes need to be tightened to ensure everyone is paying the amount their bracket specifies. Getting rid of income tax isn't the answer. Anyone paying 34% in tax shouldn't be a ""struggling American"". They're solidly in middle to upper class, and if they're struggling with finances, they need to stop overspending.

>I never once said they get taxed more than the poor.

Not sure what you mean by this; it doesn't matter if you said it, since the rich do get taxed more than the poor. The poor are paying less than 15% and personal deductibles help keep them paying even less. My point was that since the rich pay more income tax than the poor, removing income tax and making everyone pay the same amount on sales tax would hurt the poor far more. Also, the poor are mostly spending on essentials, and the sales tax on those are a much larger percentage of their income than it is for the rich.

And I'm not sure why you think I'm promoting trickle down economics; I'm arguing in favor of the poor and middle class being taxed less; it's just that removing income tax is counterproductive to that goal. [Here's an article if you don't understand what I'm saying.]

"No; an insurer putting out a bounty to shut down a polluter would be put in jail. The polluting company would need to either install a filter to reduce the incentive to create a bounty, or to buy out the insurance policies (and thus reimburse their victims).

I agree, it is sad. If you believe that the majority of middle aged+ people in our country aren't naive then I'd like whatever drug you're on. You should've invested in an education, I guess.

"Think about it. HF want lots of things, but what they love is fiat, because they are in the club that gets to create it out of thin air. Why should they be interested, in any real sense, in crypto?

Their world is being replaced. The things they own will get measured in bitcoin, but the value of their fiat will disappear. 

Their point of POWER to create money disappears.

They will have to offer real product or service in order to compete.

The 'big money' is simply not set up in this way. Right now, They don't have to compete. Just print.";1;1;False;flowbrother;dn728be;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now.

"My initial comment was a bit sarcastic, of course a shared infrastructure is a cool thing compared to monopoly banks.
But the cost for a single bitcoin transaction (let it be 6€) is more money than my banking fees of the last year - my account is free and my credit card doesn't cost a fee, neither do ATM withdrawals at ~95% of all ATMs in my country.
Proof-of-work must go away, or else no one can use those cryptos in everyday life.
BTW: credit card fees in the EU are capped at 0,3% which I would deem fairly low.";1;0;False;raidxyz;dn7wbuc;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now. Bankers begin to panic.
