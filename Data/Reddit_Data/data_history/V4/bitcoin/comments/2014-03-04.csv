Interesting, I thought you were trying to say bitcoin itself was particularly inclined toward theft and that it's mostly used by crooks. I'm glad I was wrong!;2;1;False;;cfu2n5d;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"again, that was not necessarily intended to carry any negative connotations..

I realize now how it could be taken that way, but I still think some of yall need to remove the silky hoserie from your ass-cleavage";1;0;False;ImNotDorner;cftzxyx;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"ya in retrospect i realize how that could have been taken the wrong way..

people are always gonna get robbed, regardless of how they store their wealth. hopefully they learn from their mistakes

(id still be willing to wager more criminals know about coin than normal folk however, hell I heard about it from a small time crook and the man is no tech expert by a long shot)";1;0;False;ImNotDorner;cfu8luk;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"heh I had to look that up...

why would acknowledging that virtual thievery has picked up since the dawn of crypto be spreading ""fear, uncertainty and doubt""?

if it is, its only spreading... ""fud"" to fucking idiots. I think its a bigger disservice to the ""community"" to act as if this isnt happening a lot. learn from others mistakes and all that.

The fact that criminals have embraced crypto in so many fields is a testament to its merits above all else.";1;1;False;ImNotDorner;cftzfaj;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

"wow.

This wasnt even meant as a ""knock"", its amazing how butthurt people get here when you say anything that could be even remotely considered ""bad"" about bitcoins.

Ive been in crypto since BTC was about 5 dolla, none of mine have been stolen but there were constantly threads popping up of individuals and..""businesses"" getting jacked, you cant fucking deny this.

Obviously its entirely their fault getting phished/breached etc, hell one of the best things about coin is how utterly irreversible it is imo.";1;0;False;ImNotDorner;cftxxbx;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"this is the best answer I got from all of these and its basically what I was trying to say.

Im not ""knocking"" bitcoin, I could care less if people get robbed because they werent paying fucking attention.

one of the main benefits of bitcoin is precisely the fact that i DONT have some kind of illusory safety net a la paypal, just like cold hard fiat.

Everyone here took this the wrong way and got their panties in a bunch, im glad you stayed on topic";1;2;False;ImNotDorner;cfty0na;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
getting a lot of hate for this simple statement, just feel I should clarify it is quite simple to secure your wallet to a high degree, *however* people are still constantly getting jacked because of their own iignorance. We dont have to deny this out of some kind of fear of scaring away new adopters.;1;1;False;ImNotDorner;cftxyrm;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"hahaah ""pickpocketing""?

you been playing a wee bit too much skyrim, bruv?

Pickpocketing is a very hard skill to learn, alot harder than firing out thousands of phishing mails and waiting for fuckwits to take the bait.

On the other hand, if you said: ""buy a tire iron and rob a nigga"" I would say your argument is valid in terms of simplicity, although perhaps not in terms of consequence..";1;0;False;ImNotDorner;cfty2yd;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

People probably assumed you were an antibitcoin troll. Personally, I look at this like e-mail: most people know how to use it, some still click on links, download unsolicited files, and try to help nigerian princes.;2;1;False;Rassah;cfu3fzp;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
