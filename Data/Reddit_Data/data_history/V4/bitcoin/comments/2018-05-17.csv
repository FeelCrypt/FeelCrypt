Uhh, not sure you actually understand satire which is *truly* sad. The stereotype is not even being conjectured and in the frame of reference or context the comic is making it clear that such stereotyping is perceived as stupid or wrong anyway. How you could take offense to it is actually curious because it's clearly showing you the dragon is wrong or an idiot for his thoughts.. It's making a point that the dragon's prejudice makes him a fool, so the comic is contending that such a prejudice is inherently wrong.;-2;2;False;RallyUp;dz56sz5;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

"I would not go so far as to say gold was backing anything. Gold wasn't performing too well until the mid 2000s. Not sure what all drove that price, but I do know Chinese gold purchasing was a factor.  We've seen the same with Bitcoin.  There was a while where many people I know in China had a ""fever"" to buy gold.  Then it was Bitcoin in more recent years.

If you take a step back and look at what drives the global economy, it's really business and real-estate.  So while you're correct that a stock is not currency and that Coke did well where some others did not, ""on average"" I suspect if you were careful with investing during that period of time, you could have earned the same or more money.

It is interesting to note, though, that gold tends to not lose value (even gaining value) when business slumps.

"As with most arguments between tribes of thought, the truth is somewhere in the middle. There are coins you've never heard of that came and subsequently disappeared. Some of them have been restarted and found some semblance of success, but often with drastic changes to their networks that forced their early adopters to either fork or sell. While they may continue to have limped along, they never attracted the right kinds of early adopters that would buy and hold to increase their value. 

There's one particular coin that started as far back as 2011 and has only a $4 million market cap today and is hovering around 700th in rank that never went anywhere, and it was precisely because no one hoarded it.

So you can knock the attribute of *store of value* all you want, even going so far as to start calling the people that put a high emphasis on it as conspiracy theorists, but it isn't going to change the fact that you need **both** a *medium of exchange* and a *store of value* in order for a coin to succeed.";5;0;False;Yorn2;dz57ru5;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg
