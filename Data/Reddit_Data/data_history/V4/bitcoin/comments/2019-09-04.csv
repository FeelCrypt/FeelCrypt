"Good lord what a wall of text. First I didn’t dispute the factual things you said, I disputed the crazy illuminati conspiracy level bullshit you sprouted.

Like that all microchips have backdoors. Really? **All** of them? Even the ones used by government agencies themselves? They put backdoors into their own servers? How does it work out for US chips fabbed in China? Whose backdoors do they include and how do these backdoors manifest in relation to crypto currencies which is **kinda** the topic here.

Also all those links ... that’s common knowledge by now, 90% of it is just the usual 5 eyes watching internet traffic bullshit. Again, what is the relation to crypto specifically bitcoin? All the transactions are already public, all the common **online** ways to acquire btc already employ kyc, all the **offline** ways of transacting cash to btc do not get monitored by these programs.

Don’t take it personal, but to me It’s just the usual conspiracy bullshit enlightenment that adds **nothing** to a discussion. 

There two kind of views in this world, one side despairs over a worldwide connected conspiracy that’s controlling every aspect of their lives. It’s run by super sophisticated secret agencies that can do nearly everything and control nearly everyone. The other side despairs over the gross incompetency that’s rampant in nearly every aspect of our lives that’s managed by governments.

The very links you use as proof for your points, to me that’s proof of this very incompetency. Yes, they do all of the things those links say. **But that doesn’t mean they do it well**. They can’t even stop the PotUS from chatting national security details over WhatsApp on his android phone or directly tweeting raw spysat images.

**Nothing** I see in today’s world hints at any sort of competency of the scale required by what you imply. I mean one of the programs hat a budget of 50m usd ... no government agency can get **anything** useful done on that kind of budget.

And don’t even get me started on the entire snowden affair. Just the fact that **that** guy, in **that** position, had access to **that** kind of data ... aaargh! He even got away with it! To another country! And leaked it all to the press!

No offense to all the brave men and women working to protect our way of live, this **very** much not their fault or any individuals fault. It’s a symptom of incompetent elected officials appointing woefully inadequate individuals to head and administer these agencies and then running a dog and pony show around the actual hard work happening.

"This will be my last comment in this string because it's always the same stuff and gets old running this down. 

1.  ""You assume there is a they. As in a group working together monitoring and connecting all this data. That’s the conspiracy part."" - The NSA, CIA, DIA, FBI, Mossad, MI6... These are all groups, working together as well as against each other, monitoring and connecting data. As before mentioned 5 Eyes is a great example. 
2.  ""In reality the agency monitoring cellular data is different from the one monitoring the blockchain, which doesn’t talk to the one tracking fiat transactions and the guys putting backdoors into smartphones are not talking to anyone because they are terrified of their zero day exploits getting patched."" - The majority of what you say is completely made up and it's bizarre. You show next to zero knowledge of how the intel community works and statements like the above prove it.
3. ""If what you believe was true crime wouldn’t exist. The FBI would know the exact position of every drug dealer, mass shootings that get basically announced on Internet forums wouldn’t happen and laundering money would be impossible for anyone but state actors with extremely sophisticated counter measures."" - Mass shootings are generally manipulated by the state. False flags are used for several reasons but the usual case is to redirect media narrative or take out targets. Money laundering happens in many forms - some of the most common are - the art trade and personal foundations (why every billionaire has a foundation and why the majority of the public billionaires claim to pledge the entirety of their fortunes to charity when they die. In reality they're moving their funds to their own foundations (""Charity"") which will avoid tax and be passed on/controlled by whoever they please.)
4. ""Reality is they can’t even reliably trace fiat bank transfer internationally unless it’s a national emergency with the Vice President screaming at them. They are extremely competitive and secretive, and data on the level of even petty crimes is simply not shared between the agencies to be connected. They can find out a lot of shit on you if they tried, but they won’t. There is no dossier of you on some internal Wikipedia of government agencies, you are not actively monitored any more than algae is intentionally pulled out of the ocean by fishermen."" - international fiat bank transfers are readily available for review. There is a wall of regulation and reporting which banks have to adhere to [https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm) .

5. ""Also I find it ironic that your post is full of unprovable statements and feelings. Because black budgets exist you can link intelligence agencies to the 21 trillion debt.

It also shows that the purse strings of the government and affiliated agencies are limitless - meaning they can fund many extensive operations which are not publicly known. Also, wars most countries enter are to line pockets, not to defend freedoms. The money that has been siphoned from the American public is being used by the elites who have plenty to show for it.

"The other side of the coin is that if the US bans it and pushes it underground, the infrastructure is ripe for illegal organizations, organized crime, and/or those tax hating libertarians to utilize it for an autonomous economy the US has relinquished control of.  

I'm sure your harvest moon farm model of timmy not being able to buy an apple because he's afraid a stormtrooper would thump his skull makes sense for why price would go down and no one would use it. But I have a different idea of what banning it would look like.    

The technology of it makes it perfect currency for black market use.  Since its borderless and just as mobile with a country that has lax cryptocurrnecy laws as your phone is to the internet, then people can use an app to cash it in for their favorite currency on some shady website.  It'd be too profitable of a currency transfer business that someone or some organization would do it (and lets face it, illegal or legal it will be the big banks that will profit off it the most. Cartel or sanctioned money never stopped them from accepting it). This would make it a perfect tax free haven for the competent enough to use the loopholes to not have to pay taxes on swapping cash in the US.  I don't think there's any military big enough that could raid the entire internet to stop it.  

And now instead of speculators dictating the price of crypto, you have the black market economy propelling its prices.  the billions of sinful good that travel through illegal markets would suffice to make the price nice.  A bitcoin could be worth a lb of coke, or 46 high class backpage dates.  Maybe 100 mediocre dates. You get the ideas.     

Essentially its putting cryptocurrencies in a place where the federales won't be able to generate any revenue off of it via tax;  That means no money for the military or crypto enforcement units.  Its put into a space where government can't KYC it, to better track users and better regulate illegal payments it doesn't like (goodbye 100 hookers.  I don't want coinbase  or the IRS to know I'm a slut).  Nor can uncle sam allow the financial markets to generate profits with it which makes its political donors happy. All negative externalities.

Sure it could be banned so that jonny everybody decides to just use their credit cards instead, but you can't keep good ideas banned.  Banned good ideas just create negative externalities that would not benefit the country as a whole and at this point would be too costly to implement.  If congress is even half as competent as us (I know, that's a big if), they would be able to see that banning cryptocurrencies doesn't make economical sense.

"**Flint water crisis**

The Flint water crisis began in 2014, after the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to a less costly source of the Flint River. Due to insufficient water treatment, lead leached from water pipes into the drinking water, exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels.

After a pair of scientific studies proved lead contamination was present in the water supply, a federal state of emergency was declared in January 2016 and Flint residents were instructed to use only bottled or filtered water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Some officials asserted as of early 2017 that the water quality had returned to acceptable levels, but as of January 2019, residents and officials still express doubt.

"With current banking systems, this is even worse. 

Take, for example [PSD2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive). 

Anne wants privacy. She has idealogical problems with ""Easy Mostgage®"" and chooses another mortgage for the reasons that they require full access to your payment history through PSD2.

But Bob chooses to hand over some private information for additional service. Bob decides he lets ""Easy Mostgage®"" have full access to his payment history in order to simplify his mortgage application and maybe get some discounts even. 

Now, unrelated, Bob pays Anne for some service. And Anne pays bob back what she owes him from that binge-drinking weekend. 

Easy Mostgage® now sees pieces of Anne's payment history even if Anne never gave them access! Easy Mostgage® now knows that Anne and Bob do business together, have a private relation of some sort. And they know that Anne goes on binge-drinking weekends, despite her explicitly choosing not to give this data to Easy Mostgage®.

The exact same issues occur when Anne is a fine citizen, but Bob's payment history is monitored by the Drug Police; and Anne and Bob have some unrelated payments. Simply because there are always at least two parties involved in a transaction, yet you want to monitor only one party.

This problem with surveillance something that Bitcoin solves a little, but which layers like Lightning or blockchain set-ups like Monero solve in much more solid ways even.

I don’t buy into the whole Bitcoin thing as a replacement for fiat. The reason fiat is great is because there are a lot of institutions in place that can act as an authority and help you store, lend, borrow, invest, and protect money. For example, I pay someone $100 but they don’t give me the item I bought off of them or it’s defective. I now have no recourse because there’s no authoritative entity that can help me recoup my funds in the case of fraud and the recipient can run with the money. By the time we get cryptocurrency to the same level of infrastructure as fiat, there will be little distinction and it’ll make you wonder what made you love Bitcoin in the first place. There are too many players in major fiat currencies that will let it get devalued. So fuck “freedom” with my cash given this limitation. Bitcoin is nothing more than a black market currency. Unless you live in a shithole country like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, you’re better off with your country’s fiat.;1;1;False;bhargavat;eyxnoym;Why Bitcoin?;cz65ds;https://i.redd.it/fxx69x6haek31.jpg
