"Which developer do you have suggesting this would be trivial?

Mostly the people that speak of  ""adding decimal places"" to Bitcoin have a total misunderstanding  of what is required from a programming standpoint to represent exact real-number decimal quantities including efficient support for all the basic native arithmetic math functions to work with no rounding acceptable  OR didn't understand that as far as the Bitcoin protocol is concerned there is no such thing as  ""1 Bitcoin"",   there are  ONLY base Units called Satoshi,  and 1  Bitcoin is defined  at a higher level to be  10^8  Satoshi.

People who've said ""8 decimal places""   was an arbitrary cut-off in the  user interface, GUI, or something,  just had no idea what they were talking about,   otherwise they'd realize that the proposition: add X  decimal places is equivalent saying that now: ""1 Bitcoin should now  be 10^(8+X) Satoshi"".

Then to re-formulate the base units:  it is necessary that EVERY place any of piece of software previously calculated  1 BTC = 10^8  Satoshi,  the new calculation has to change to  1 BTC = 10^(8+X),     AND  for every transaction BEFORE an agreed Cutoff,   the Base Unit quantities need to be multipled by  10^X    to adjust the number of Satoshis  created from every past and future action  for the new base units.

This also means future mining rewards after the cutoff block number need to be adjusted to be multiplied by 10^X.

The Base Units are commonly represented in the Bitcoin core itself AND in many  3rd party software programs as a  structural **64-bit integer**   int64_t.

Most runtime environments don't have a 128-Bit integer datatype available,  or  N-Bit Integer datatype,  so even if you could just increase the number of bits in the data structure ----  that is a non-trivial set of changes to implementation   just  to restore  the  original Arithmetic logic.

You would have a great gnashing of teeth, as common language implementations don't provide a nice clean way for programmers to do  native arithmetic on 128-bit numbers.    The result will require some custom code  OR use of a 3rd party math library,   and there is a performance cost.

Making a fundamental change to the size in bits of the transaction structure is an even more  problematic issue to deal with;   this  would definitely be an ATYPICAL change.     Most forks and changes  to the Bitcoin protocol have been about changing the **MEANING** or **Interpretation**  of what a valid transaction is,  not changing the binary formats used to send data over the network ---   When the data formats don't actually change - old and new clients   can see that there is a fork;    they may  disagree on  what is valid,  But  they can all still read all the transactions.

Changing this format without creating major instability would require adding versioning to the transaction inputs and output formats in some way,  and getting THAT change to support both the old format and a new future format completely propagated throughout the ecosystem  before  activating usage of a new format and conducting a base units change.

There are multiple major hurdles trying to change the base units.

(1) Sufficiency of demand:   Could you even justify it,  given all the many hours of developer time that will be required for all Wallets and BTC-related software?

(2) Resistance to change by the installed base.    1 Satoshi has already been established to mean a certain value.    Changing the base unit  is going to  invalidate a lot of documentation.

(3) Technical hurdles in formulating and deploying an inherently breaking change  requiring multiple phases of implementation  without  widespread major issues for users (have simultaneous support for old and new data formats fully deployed,  before using the new formats).

Regarding implementation:

If try just shifting the base units without expanding the structure field,  then you'll  run into a problem because  2^64   only has 19 decimal places to play with.

For example: if you want  10^16  Satoshi to become the new base unit,  then you will upset users,  Because it will no longer to possible to transfer more than   1844 Bitcoins in a single transaction output.

The current base unit size allows up to a maximum of  184,467 Million Bitcoins to be transferred within a 64-bit integer;   Realistically,    the most decimal places you could add would be about 5,   because  it's unlikely for  more than 1 Million BTC to be required in a single transaction.

with a 5% deflation, the minimum cost of a loan is 5% if it gets lend out for 0% nominal interest. This doesn't change if its 1000x contracts over decades or just one. 

5% is pretty high on a loan compared to the -5% during an inflation. Businesses would have to work harder to make their investment worth that loan.

so, the models assume that outcomes that are being forecast do not differ systematically from the market equilibrium results and people don't do systematic errors when predicting the future.
This assumption is always part of everything I wrote here. When I talk about a single loan then it represents the market equilibrium and the timeframe doesn't really matter here.

>Let's assume the Real Interest Rate is: 5%
>If there is 5% inflation in the economy, the lender will demand 10% on the loan.

what makes you so sure that the lender can realize his demands? I mean the cost of opportunity alone will drive more people into lending out money since
doing nothing with your money will lead to not earning the 10%. More people will try to lend out money to cover the inflation alone leading to a higher supply of loans versus the same demand of loans.

In your deflation scenario, not doing anything with your money would have no opportunity costs at all. Fewer people will lend out money -> money supply is lower -> same demand for money -> higher interest rates.

>If there is 5% deflation in the economy, the lender will demand 0% on the loan.

why would anyone lend money for the nominal rate of 0% and lower? You lend me 100$ just to get 100$ back in a year? You obviously will ask for more to cover possible risks and efforts you have to put in for that loan.

>No, since inflation is incorporated into the nominal interest rate. If you live in a society that has 5% inflation and 5% real interest rates, you won't get a loan for under 10%.

that's the Fisher equation. It also says that loans that get lend out for 10% interest in a 5% inflation result in 5% real interest. You argue like if the real interest determines the nominal interest rates and inflation rate while it's clearly the other way around. 

The real interest rate can only be determined Ex-post when the actual inflation is known (Wikipedia) and lenders may not be able to realize their desired real interest. I mean there could be 5% inflation but the lenders are only able to realize a 6% nominal interest rate (due to supply and demand... maybe no one needs loans at all) which will result in a 1% real interest rate.


[here a chart over a longer period showing the inflation, nominal interest, and real interest](https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/images/prb0853_Fig1-e.gif)
you can clearly see that there were periods of negative real interest because lenders weren't able to realize higher nominal rates. Loans are bound to supply and demand as well as any other good. Even if the inflation would always be a constant and never changes - the real interest would still go up and down due to increasing or decreasing demand or supply for loans.

">You were just calculating the real interest rate

>The ""cost"" of the loan is determined by the real interest rate, not the nominal one.

correct

>Inflation and deflation doesn't change the real interest rate

ofc it does? The concept of real interest rate is used to account for the impact of inflation. In the case of a loan, it is this real interest that the lender effectively receives.

>Nominal interest rates is the rate of interest before adjustment for inflation (in contrast with the real interest rate)

>Real interest can be described more formally by the Fisher equation, which states that the real interest rate is approximately the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.

(wikipedia)

>I know how to calculate the real interest rate.

are you sure?
equation according to Fisher: real interest rate(r) = nominal interest rate (i) - expected inflation rate(p)

changing the inflation will directly affect the real interest rate. 

Example: If the inflation rises after I got a loan then it would get cheaper.
in case of a sudden hyperinflation, a 1000$ 2% interest loan could be worthless in a year aka 'cost' of the loan would be next to nothing. How can you say that Inflation and deflation don't change the real interest rate????

">The concept of real interest rate is useful to account for the impact of inflation

That's an understatement. 

In the long run and ceteris paribus, the real interest rate is the only thing that matters. 

Sure you can fuck up loan contracts in the short term with changing price levels. That goes equally for inflation and deflation. 

>changing the inflation will directly affect the real interest rate

No. The real interest rate is exactly that: ""The *REAL* interest rate""

Changing inflation just changes the nominal rate. 

(In the long term. In the short term you can fuck up things as much as you want)

>If the inflation rises after I got a loan then it would get cheaper.

>with a 5% deflation, the minimum cost of a loan is 5% if it gets lend out for 0% nominal interest [...] Businesses would have to work harder to make their investment worth that loan.

The problem is that you are favouring one party above the other. 

Let's assume the Real Interest Rate is: 5%

If there is 5% inflation in the economy, the lender will demand 10% on the loan. 

If there is 5% deflation in the economy, the lender will demand 0% on the loan. 

>inflation is always better for the borrower regardless if this long-term or short term.

No, since inflation is incorporated into the nominal interest rate. If you live in a society that has 5% inflation and 5% real interest rates, you won't get a loan for under 10%. 

So the borrower benefits nothing. He only benefits if there are changes in the interest rate that have not been foreseen and not been incorporated into the nominal rate. 

This is why societies with volatile inflation rates have the opportunity of indexing the loans (the interest rate changes with the inflation)

a 100-year-long loan for 2% p.a nominal interest and 10% inflation p.a would still 'costs' less than a 2% p.a nominal interest and 2% inflation.

>Changing inflation just changes the nominal rate.

that's not what Wikipedia and the equations say.

Enough instability in the US, isolationism, xenophobia, and loss of credibility internationally means a weaker dollar. People divest their holdings in USD and flock to BTC like  citizens of other countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela are doing. I anticipate that Russia, China, and Japan will siphon off USD via bitcoin and will become the best HODLRs ever. Whoever has the most will have America by the balls eventually.

Bitcoin hasn’t shifted any paradigm. It’s merely a commodity that is being traded at high value due to low supply, and speculation. It is currently completely worthless as a currency due to its rapid value increase.

"It isn't true at all...for now. That's why I mentioned this process will happen gradually. Barring some MAJOR financial disaster this shift will happen over time. US purchasing power is only as strong as the dollar. Domestically it doesn't matter how much money the rich have if they aren't spending it. The middle class and poor are already using their income for healthcare, education, and the rising cost of necessary goods. Wage stagnation reduces the power of the dollar. This decline has happened since the 80s. In their greed and isolation, the American rich have created a society where the dollar is rapidly turning into a shit currency only useful for transferring debt and not an indicator of productivity or growth. Instead we rely more and more on consumers OUTSIDE our country to purchase from us.  This is why bitcoin is so valuable as trading is built into it. It is both a wealth holder and means of economic mobility. If it did not move, it would be worthless, unlike the stagnant American dollar. Crypto enables individuals to gradually transition into other markets as needed. The only thing holding it back at this point is widespread adoption which is being rectified via debit cards, ATMs, and diversified savings portfolios. The easier it is to get off the ""dollar grid"" the weaker the dollar becomes. This void will gradually be filled by other currencies including crypto.  The government will print more and more to make up the difference to no avail. This is why I say war is the only option to save the status quo. There's a reason why we have military bases all over the world and it isn't to protect us so from terror. The American dollar is only as strong as the people we can intimidate into using it. Even still you can't FORCE the whole world to use your currency if it goes to shit. As the reputation of America declines, so does the dollar. The Chinese Yuan will most likely be the international currency of choice in the next 50 years. With them investing heavily in crypto the will dominate the exchanges (as most bitcoin will be mined) and they will be pocketing the transaction fees.

Climate change is forcing mass migrations that will tax countries further. We're already seeing this happen in Florida with the Puerto Rican disaster.

If bitcoin stabilizes at any value at or above current, and 2 billion people use it as currency, then I won’t have any argument. It will have fulfilled its role as a currency, and then its value will be obvious.

But that hasn’t happened, and doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. Lots of time between now and that potential future, and lots of opportunity for something to occur which prevents it from happening. 

If it was certain, and the future value was known, then that would be the current value. Until then, it’s all just guesswork. Some will be right and others wrong.

"I think everyone knows that it won’t go forever. The question is, will it rise then settle, will it fall then settle, or will it crash and burn. Those are the only three possible options that i can think of. 

If it settles, and holds its value, then becomes adopted as currency, it could stay stable indefinitely. But lots of things need to align for that. First, it needs to stay stable for a long enough period for people to stop thinking the value will fluctuate. It needs to be usable. It needs to be accepted by lots more merchants and have low transaction fees (at least as low as credit cards have now). 

The problem as I see it, is that it’s main current value is purely speculative. So if there is a downturn, which doesn’t immediately correct, it could lead to a sell off and a crash. This wouldn’t be the first time something skyrockets in value, then plunges and dies. 

If we could see the future, we’d all be rich. But we can’t. We can only take our best guess. With bitcoin, your guess is as good as mine.  I can’t begin to predict where it will go. I’m always a bit cautious, so I think there are many more ways for it to go bad then for it to go right... in the long term that is.  It seems a bit too precarious for my liking.

"Sure, but many things are more easily predicted based on historical reality. 

For instance, tomorrow the US dollar could collapse. We can’t be certain it won’t. But we can be certain of a few things that would necessarily follow if it did. The entire worlds economy would be harmed, including crypto currencies. Because most things are directly or indirectly tied to large currency systems. If the dollar collapses, so do all US reliant companies, and those employed by them, leading to a depression, leading to stifled growth and an inability for people to buy products, including commodities, including bitcoin. Unemployed people sell assets to live, including bitcoin they now hold because they don’t need the spendable money. But fewer people have disposable money to buy, so the price drops. 

That’s why some investments are considered high risk, high reward... or low risk, low reward. The greater the risk, the more rapid one can get returns. The very fact that the value of bitcoin is rapidly rising highlights its risk.  The more things are dependent on the stability of a currency or commodity, the most stable it is. It’s similar to large corporations who are too big to fail. It means that they can’t be allowed to fail because it would ruin the entire economy. So it has the backing of that entire economy. So it won’t likely ever fail, even if it would without external help, because it will always be bailed out.

"Volatility is a stock going down 12% then up 14% then down 20% then down 20% then up 40%

Risk is the potential for loss. 

Volatile commodities have more downswings, so more chance of selling on the down. Therefore more potential for loss. 

Volatility is tied to risk, but is not synonymous. 

A stock that goes up 1% a month forever has no risk. There is no down. It’s only up. There is a risk of an unforeseen down, but theoretically speaking, there isn’t a down in this instance.  So you can predict the future value of that investment with reasonable accuracy. The risk is minimal. 

A volatile stock is much harder to predict. In any given time frame, it can be up or down. You can gain or lose. That is risk. The likelihood of loss. 

Now, some volatile commodities can be predictable over a longer period, and risk can be mitigated. But it is still at greater risk for not hitting a given prediction. 

Am I making sense?

The stock market is more volatile than the US dollar. If you had a month to invest your money, after which you had to settle up, it would be far more risky to put it in the market than to keep it as cash. However, given the performance of the stock market over a 30 year period, it is less risky to put your money in the market if you could leave it there for 30 years.... even though it is more volatile. Because we can predict with reasonable certainty that the value of the cash will decrease over that time, and the value of the stocks will increase over that time. 

The issue with bitcoin is that it isn’t old enough to have a predictable future. What is the financial gain/loss over a given time period?  I don’t know. No one does. What is the expected value in 1 year?  5? 30?  It isn’t predictable because it isn’t old enough to have a history to compare it against.  The stock market has been around long enough to see the repeat trends over multiple long periods, and short periods. We can predict things due to large datasets of history. We don’t have that with btc. We have an unknowable future, which makes it a risky proposition. It could go way up, or it could crash and burn at any moment. It isn’t stable yet, which is risky.

"I will be selling part of what I make, and I won't be keeping cards for 5 years. I will invest some of the bitcoin into expanding my operation. If I can grow it far enaugh, and the marked stays relatively ok its possible to actually live of if you have enaugh invested. I suspect i will sell and replace with newer better cards around every 1 to 1.5 years. There should be a sweet spot, before the value start dropping off fast.  Gpus do not lose value very fast anymore. It has to be thought of more as a business. Income, return of investment, expenses, power costs etc. It's more profitable than buying if bitcoin stagnate or grow slowly for a while. Lower risk since I can always recover some of the investments through the sale of the equipment.

There is also the hobby factor for a computer engineer like myself. Running a machine with 13 gpus come with its own unique challenges. Going to 25 gpus over black Friday, and that should generate around 1800 usd in bitcoin per month, at an investment of 15000. From a business perspective, that's a pretty good deal. That's another 1800 a month spending money, and I'm aware of the risk but I can chose to convert into usd every month and lower it. I personally chose to gamble on bitcoin succeeding. I can afford to lose the investment, and the upside if bitcoin gets adopted more mainstream is giantic. In 10 years I would regret not investing if bitcoin explodes, more than losing the investment if it crashes. The upside is early retirement, the realistic worst-case downside is losing half my investments in computer equipment.

They were like ""You have been stupid"", you could've had even more tons of €s now, if you had kept them.

> Well, no. By spending it, I added weight to the idea that BTC has a value, that you can exchange it for other value. The stronger that idea, the higher the price.

It matters little what it is spend on, be it drugs, beekeeper-equipment, pizza's or other (crypto)currencies: the point is that the only thing that will make a price go up, is if more people believe it has a value. A stolen leonardo-da-vinci painting, one that no-one, not even other criminals will want to buy, is essentially worthless. A crypto-currency that cannot be spent on anything, not now, not in the future, is worthless too.

When a billion people own and trade in bitcoin on this planet, just even having 1/10 of a coin is going to make you wealthy.

But back in the day, it was a very sketchy climate back then in the early days. 

If you look at the charts, economic unrest in Greece and Zimbabwe have set off the bitcoin to new highs.

Bitcoin is now a portable store of value and wealth.

Major things behind the scenes on political levels had to take place for bitcoin to be what it is right now.

And guess what? The more countries that experience civil unrest, the more bitcoin will be the go to way to store wealth, making it portable across borders.";1;0;False;carpartsyouneed;dq4bw75;This hurts me in a different level.;7eagm3;https://i.redd.it/vrmgaea506zz.jpg

And if you don't like the fees you exchange it for a better crypto when you are ready to make purchases.

"> And this is where we disagree.

I agree that we have differing opinions on what will happen.  I have trust in the free market system, especially as it relates to technology, keeping ISPs in line.  We'll have to wait and see how it plays out.  If the evil corporations abuse the system, all it takes is the stroke of a pen for Net Neutrality to be restored.

>History shows us that corporations will always, always, always choose the option that nets them the most profit, ethics be damned.

History shows us that the free market holds corporations accountable, even where there are limited choices for consumers.  I'll use the cell phone industry as an example.  There are only a handful of nationwide providers in the US, right?  They used to all offer unlimited cellular data use because they had to remain competitive.  Then after smartphones became data hogs, they all gradually migrated to fixed caps on cellular data.  Then one of the smaller providers removed those cellular data caps and saw an influx of customers, which caused the other companies to follow suit.  The cell phone providers aren't in collusion, they're just adjusting to what the free market will bear.  There are countless other examples of the free market working without government regulation.  Even OPEC can't control worldwide oil outputs with 100% certainty, how would a group of unaffiliated ISPs in the US manage to cripple Bitcoin with 100% certainty?";-1;1;False;kernelmustard29;dq5w67j;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!

But they don't because their market research shows insufficient demand for more than 1 provider in that area.

So the governing authority (the FCC in this analogy) created Title II, which said ""Hey, no using swords to hurt people.""

Some of the people with swords (the ISPs in this analogy said) said ""Hey, nobody ever hurt anyone before. We don't need those stupid rules to tell us not to. Just repeal those stupid rules. We promise we won't hurt people ""

"> You are directly challenging the articles data bout infrastructure investment since 2015, are you saying the data is bad, or the correlation should be ignored? I just want to be clear what your position is because you didn't provide contrarian data just subjective response from ISPs.

Correlation does not equal causation. Show me the incontrovertible evidence that lack of investment is because of Title II. Otherwise all you have is conjecture which flies in the face of the admissions of ISPs themselves.

> Someone posted a summary of NN cases here in the USA and Canada, there were fewer than 10 of them in 20 years, and the majority if not all were intervened upon by the FCC and and the bad actors were dealt with.

First, we're dealing with a very different, anti-consumer FCC today. I have no faith in a Verizon lawyer to preserve the interests of anyone but Verizon and similar ISPs. Next, Net Neutrality hasn't become such a big issue until streaming services became big, prying Cable TV profits away from cable companies offering those services. 20 years ago was 1997. Net Neutrality was hardly a hot topic then. This shift only happened in recent years and forced them to pay attention to the internet and bandwidth usage because offering good internet service was hurting their other services.

> I'm not ignorant, I have to be subjective and somewhat anecdotal here but I've used comcast, att, and Spectrum and have never been throttled or capped from what I can tell. I would consider my activity heavy and above average regarding bandwidth.

Other than Spectrum, if you signed up for Comcast or AT&T somewhat recently, barring gigabit plans, you probably have been capped. You might be capped now. It's extremely common and hard to get away from. Some ISPs offer unlimited for $50 extra. Not all. Some just want you to eat the overage fee.

> but you can still get unlimited plans from sprint/cricket?

Sprint still throttles even on their unlimited plans. Verizon and AT&T's unlimited data plan has a \*drumroll\* data cap!! After which they throttle. Same with Cricket.

Timely 

>>As millions flocked to the web for the first time in the 1990s, President Clinton and a Republican Congress decided “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet.” In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the government called for an internet “unfettered by Federal or State regulation.” The result of that fateful decision was the greatest free-market success story in history.

Encouraged by light-touch regulation, private companies invested over $1.5 trillion in nearly two decades to build out American communications networks. Without having to ask anyone’s permission, innovators everywhere used the internet’s open platform to start companies that have transformed how billions of people live and work.

But that changed in 2014. Just days after a poor midterm election result, President Obama publicly pressured the Federal Communications Commission to reject the longstanding consensus on a market-based approach to the internet. He instead urged the agency to impose upon internet service providers a creaky regulatory framework called “Title II,” which was designed in the 1930s to tame the Ma Bell telephone monopoly. A few months later, the FCC followed President Obama’s instructions on a party-line vote. I voted “no,” but the agency’s majority chose micromanagement over markets.

This burdensome regulation has failed consumers and businesses alike. **In the two years after the FCC’s decision, broadband network investment dropped more than 5.6%—the first time a decline has happened outside of a recession.** If the current rules are left in place, millions of Americans who are on the wrong side of the digital divide would have to wait years to get more broadband.

The effect has been particularly serious for smaller internet service providers. They don’t have the time, money or lawyers to cut through a thicket of complex rules.** The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, which represents small fixed wireless companies that generally operate in rural America, found that more than 80% of its members “incurred additional expense in complying with the Title II rules, had delayed or reduced network expansion**, had delayed or reduced services and had allocated budget to comply with the rules.” They aren’t alone. Other small companies have told the FCC that these regulations have forced them to cancel, delay or curtail upgrades to their fiber networks.

The uncertainty surrounding the FCC’s onerous rules has also slowed the introduction of new services. One major company reported that it put on hold a project to build out its out-of-home Wi-Fi network partly because it wasn’t sure if the FCC would approve of its business model. **Nineteen municipal internet service providers—that is, city-owned nonprofits—told the this past May that they “often delay or hold off from rolling out a new feature or service because we cannot afford to deal with a potential complaint and enforcement action.”**

This is why I’m proposing today that my colleagues at the Federal Communications Commission repeal President Obama’s heavy-handed internet regulations.** Instead the FCC simply would require internet service providers to be transparent so that consumers can buy the plan that’s best for them.** And entrepreneurs and other small businesses would have the technical information they need to innovate. **The Federal trade Commission would police ISPs, protect consumers and promote competition, just as it did before 2015.** Instead of being flyspecked by lawyers and bureaucrats, the internet would once again thrive under engineers and entrepreneurs.

The FCC will vote on this proposal on Dec. 14. If it passes, Washington will return to the bipartisan approach that made the internet what it is today. Consumers will benefit from greater investment in digital infrastructure, which will create jobs, increase competition, and lead to better, faster, and cheaper internet access—especially in rural America.

In the next few weeks, anti-market ideologues are going to try to scare the American people. They’ll argue that government control is the only way to assure a free and open internet. They’ll assert that repealing utility-style regulation will destroy the internet as we know it and harm innovation. They’ll allege that free speech online is at risk. Don’t fall for the fearmongering.

We have proof that markets work: For almost two decades, the U.S. had a free and open internet without these heavy-handed rules. There was no market failure before 2015. Americans weren’t living in a digital dystopia before the FCC seized power. To the contrary, millions enjoyed an online economy that was the envy of the world. They experienced the most powerful platform ever seen for permission-less innovation and expression. Next month, I hope the FCC will choose to return to the common-sense policies that helped the online world transform the physical one.";10;2;False;CONTROLurKEYS;dq5na88;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!

The business gets the advantage of a good reputation and more money, and is able to offset the costs of research on the free market, while the entrepreneur has just built a new field and can watch his business grow, accountable to the consumer to ensure his reputation stays sterling.

What the fuck is going on in this thread? It's full of the exact opposite of what I expected to see from you guys.

Internet is a utility. All websites and internet should be equal. I don't want some corporation telling me what I can do online, just like we all don't want a few miners telling us what to do with our Bitcoin.

The current Net Neutrality regulations keep everything an even playing field. The electric company doesn't tell me what appliances I can buy. My ISP shouldn't tell me what sites I can visit.

Imagine you've only got one ISP choice (a real issue in many places). Now imagine your bank automatically closes any account that has Bitcoin-related activity.

Now imagine your bank has partnered with your ISP to block your access to all other banks, so you can't make a new account at a more Bitcoin-friendly bank.

Or maybe this...Imagine your ISP partners with an online retailer that doesn't accept Bitcoin, and blocks your access to places that do accept it.

Net Neutrality is the difference between:

It is hard to believe that a community once full of libertarians is supporting something so naive like that. Nothing good can come from the government. Seriously, every law or regulation that may look good have backdoors in it to give more power for the government. Just get the politicians dirty hands away from the internet, don't try to steer the government to something you think is good.
