"Don't be asinine, of course the value cannot exceed the value of the planet. You are literally pulling this idea out of thin air and trying to foist it upon me like I was the one who said it.

However, your figure of 770% is well within bitcoins current growth rate, in fact it is low. I know, I know bitcoin can't keep the same growth rate as it has forever. So? The internet grew at an unprecedented pace as well and guess what, it is still here. Economies have bull markets, bear markets, and bubbles. This is what they do (The US FED would disagree with me however).

How about you take a more reasonable figure of 1-10% of the world GDP as the top end to bitcoin's valuation? It would easily have an [s-curve adoption rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) and it would include the current growth easily.

The s-curve is seen all over in biological systems and technical systems everywhere. Cellphones, smartphones, laptops, insect growth, tablets, plant growth, email, and [so many more things have an s-curve adoption](http://goo.gl/0VqrGc).

The one who is being delusional is not me, it is you. You are deluding yourself into thinking that I have not heard your arguments a hundred times by now. That you are the first person to be reasonable in the face of my ""delusional frenzy."" That I am an unreasonable gambler and that I haven't a clue what I am talking about.

I read fast, like 300-400WPM fast. My job allows me to read up to 6 hours a day if I wish, it is the best thing about my lacking paycheck. I read about bitcoin, economics, technology, crypto, and anything which tickles my fancy *every day*. I spend over a hundred hours a month reading and I have read about bitcoin for just over two years. I feel safe saying that I have an educated opinion about my topic of interest.

How much do you know about bitcoin? About finance? Money? Have you spent even a fraction of the time I have thinking about this?

Bitcoin is a legitimate financial tool and it will change the world. Boom or bust it will change the planet just like radio, tv, and the internet.

If we start from the assumption that the current value of a single bitcoin is approximately $650, then in order for a single bitcoin to reach $5,000 by the end of 2015, the value of bitcoin would have to increase by 770% over the next 22 months. At that rate, in less than a decade, the value of bitcoin would be __*QUADRUPLE* the annual GDP of *the entire planet*.__ Does that sound like a reasonable expectation to you? Do you actually believe it would be possible for bitcoin to not only supplant every other form of currency currently in existence, but also somehow magically quadruple the productivity of the entire planet... *in less than 10 years?!?!!* I'm sorry, but that is delusional.;1;1;False;RalphKrapden;cffo0ps;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

">Oh really? And what do you think creates demand?

Depends on what security you are talking about. Food is obvious, oil is too, houses and land have obvious utility. Lets try something like gold. Gold is in demand because it is: scarce, fungible, divisible, durable, portable, and non-consumable (kinda). So besides the obvious small industrial use for electronics why does gold command a high price?

Because people believe it to be a store of value.

Granted they have thousands of years of history on their side. But the next question is, what is value? You can value *anything*. We have valued shells, beads, dye, china, silk, tulips, ivory, obsidian, quetzal feathers, and so many more things. Value is whatever you say it is. This is as true of WOW gold as it is of a $100 bill.

The only real question left is, will other people value bitcoin besides bitcoiners? Which is why the price is $600 and not $60k+

Don't try to school me on the properties and history of money. I know enough to know what bitcoin is and what it is not.

> What is the point of having a decentralized currency if you're subjected to the whims of a handful of large players?

Read about the decentralized exchanges, localbitcoins, or really how there is a zero barrier to entry to make a competing exchange. I buy and sell bitcoins on a regular basis.

>...or people could just decide to stop using it because it's such a pain in the ass. 

Not only is this opinion, it seems like you haven't even tried to use bitcoin. Buying things with bitcoin on my phone is a joy. But hey, you can feel this way if you want.

>If people decide to not use it

Why yes, this is a problem. I do believe that is why bitcoin is worth $500 and not $100k yet. That is how these things work right? When you invest in a growing company, commodity, or bond you are hoping the price will go up and that your analysis of the security is better than everyone elses.

>How much trade is conducted in bitcoin? I mean actual trade of goods and services, not just speculators trying to turn a quick buck? I see people making the occasional purchase with bitcoin just for the novelty of it and to reap that sweet, sweet karma on reddit... but how many people are earning a paycheck in (and making 100% of their purchases in) bitcoin?

Good point, but see my above comment #1. And #2 I know that Overstock just made a million in sales, I also know that tigerdirect has done a lot of business and bitcoin black friday was one of bitcoin's biggest commerce days of all time. Is it enough? We shall see.

> I see people making the occasional purchase with bitcoin just for the novelty of it and to reap that sweet, sweet karma on reddit

Karma? I literally had not heard of this until you told me. Sounds like a waste of money to me. But I have heard of worse ways to waste your money. Big deal, people buy what they want.

>For bitcoin to reach $5,000 by the end of 2015, based on the approximate number of coins that will be in circulation by that time, it would have a market capitalization of more than $70 billion... that's more than the annual GDP (nominal) of Cuba. Do you honestly believe bitcoin will produce enough economic activity to get it there?

Let's take gold as an example: The consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Consumption)). This means that if we parked a gold asteroid in orbit tomorrow that at least 40% of gold consumption(demand) would fall through the floor. I would imagine that would affect the demand for jewelry as well.

Seems to me that gold does not have a lot of industrial purposes. So what gives gold the majority of it's value? Speculation and a small supply. A securities economic activity is not an indicator of it's value. Supply and demand are.

People see value in bitcoin so the value rises. They hoard it so the supply decreases. Bubble? We shall see.

>speculators pumping up the price on sketchy ""exchanges"" are going to get it there, especially when one or more of those exchanges goes tits up.

What in the world do exchanges have to do with the value of bitcoin? That is like saying that the NYSE died and so the USD will die. Who cares? 

Pump bitcoin? Well maybe, if you check out the bitcointalk forums, you can see that there is someone who has been dubbed, ""the benevolent manipulator."" Who keeps bitcoin from doing crazy price swings in between the short term bubbles. Are they going to dump all their coins at some point and destroy bitcoin? Idk but I think bitcoin will be able to survive, I invested didn't I?

Whatever happens, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The market demands it. If you don't get it, you are no different than the people who thought the internet was stupid and that ""640K of memory should be enough for anybody.""

"I would like an apology.

How dare you try to assassinate my character by implying that I am a compulsive gambler. And even if I was, that would not mean that my opinion and knowledge was not valid.

You have no idea who I am, you have no idea who bitcoiners are. You have no clue what you are talking about. 

I am work at a TV station and I make about $20k a year. I save as much money as I can from *every* paycheck so I can buy a home. I am part of the local reddit community, I volunteer with local kids and animals, and I am a respected member of my community. I also happen to own bitcoins.

I invested back when they were $11-$60 and I bought them because I thought they were a revolutionary idea.

To give you an idea towards my gambling tendencies I am going to bore you with a peek into my weekly life. A casino was recently erected about 3 blocks from my work. I go there every few weeks to eat at the large number of restaurants inside. I have never once sat at the gambling tables. I feel that slots and cards are boring.

Now onto your absolute falsity that ""bitcoin holders have the mentality of a compulsive gambler"". Lets list some people who I know quite well. I volunteer with kids and they like to hear about bitcoins because they look up to me a large number of them have $1-$20 worth of bitcoin. I even gave one young lady who was a helpful friend an entire bitcoin when they were worth $30 or so, needless to say she is very happy. Are they gamblers?

How about the homeless people over at [Sean's Outpost](http://seansoutpost.com/)? Or the [martial arts instructor in Japan](http://redd.it/1s2pal) who accepted over 100btc for lessons when they were $30-$40 and he just decided to keep them (3:30 in the linked videos)? Or the countless other merchants who have decided that there may be something to this bitcoin thing after accepting them via bitpay? Seem like ""compulsive gamblers"" to you?

Your proxy attack on bitcoin via my personal dispositions was insulting and totally biased.

As for my bet, I made it simply because I was tired of people like you coming to this sub with preconceived notions and mocking people who were legitimate investors like myself. There are plenty of Wall St traders who do similar work and they get paid very well for it. If you think there aren't legitimate uses of bitcoin and investing in bitcoin, you are dead wrong.

I frustrated and I was tired of the recent influx of people who aren't educated about bitcoin which have all been calling totally legitimate comments outlandish. My bet was an easy way to get people to take my comments seriously. I knew you wouldn't take it, you don't know enough about bitcoin. If you did, you would have known that my bet was not something you wanted to be on the other side of.

Yes to invest in bitcoin is to speculate, but it is no different from speculating on gold, wheat, stocks, bonds, or land. All of those people have legitimate speculations on the potential price of bitcoin. There were also people who were laughed out to of the room when they talked about, ""personal computers."" They were considered insane too. We simply see something you do not.

Of course there are gamblers within bitcoin, just head over to the plethora of gambling sites and browse the forums to see the poor people who have lost hundreds if not thousands of bitcoins. But your attempt to say that bitcoiners are all gambling addicts is like saying that all christians are going to convert you, or that all gun enthusiasts are irrational and they love violence. It is simply and overgeneralization.

So I say again, do you care to test your fundamental analysis of bitcoin to mine? I wouldn't do it if I were you, you have no idea what you are talking about.";1;1;False;XxionxX;cffkzwl;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

You realise bitcoin is based purely on speculation, moreso than any other currency which to a certain extent is based on economic events, the movement of indices and commodities.

I'm more skeptical of bitcoin than almost anyone here. But saying it isn't producing anything is wrong. It's just like paypal in a sense, it's a service (intended to be) and provide value for the flexibility, privacy,  security it offers.
