"Who's to say?  Think about these supply demand factors...

Over 70% of the bitcoin has already been mined.

A decent portion of that has been lost forever.

Everyday only 800 new bitcoin come into existence and that will be cut in half in a few years.

The final < 30% of the bitcoin supply will be mined over the next 120 years!

How many more bitcoin are yet to be lost forever?

Less than 1/10 of 1% of the world population is in.  The big players aren't in yet except for a tiny minority.  

If the demand doubles what happens to the price?  Depends on how bad those people want it and how reluctant the holders are to selling.

What can demand realistically do over the next 20 years?

If BTC is still going strong in 20 years I think it will be exponentially more than it is.

What can kill or severely harm it?  

Another MUCH better crypto, BTC has first mover advantage.


A cataclysmic event affecting the entire world.

Ultimately, down to the level of about 100 to 1000 satoshis is where the real game is. We're going to turn bitcoin into petabyte sized global database to store what really matters. Not trivial stuff like spending bitcoin to buy stuff.

Deep down I at least am trying to turn bitcoin into an uncensorable time stamp database. We'll use it to store records of who owns what.

You know, not everyone has the same goals. :) Just consider me to be along for the ride! Other people with other goals are welcome here too and I welcome them, and it's off to the races. We can fork the coin when needs are incompatible. We can't see the future, so who knows.

"I disagree, if you want actual mass adoption you need something absolutely bulletproof and trustworthy or adoption will never be possible. Bitcoin has a much smaller attack surface and much more conservative development than everything else.

You can talk about sharding and tangles and shit but the more complex it is, the more likely it has a issue.

Bitcoin is comparatively simple and stable and that's what will bring the masses in and I all the LN demos I've seen look about as easy as using bitcoin now. ";2;0;False;VladamirK;dr4sgnl;Working Hard or Hardly Working?;7j584c;https://i.redd.it/c2o6204tvc301.jpg

Well futures is an instrument, with which you can hedge your risk, I.E. reduce your risk of hypothetical crash by agree upon a price ahead of time. Yes many use it as a mechanism to short current growth, but we didn't need any shorting instruments, due to sheer volatility. The thing is that futures is never an option unless there is an increased chance of a crash.;1;0;False;Jeremy-Whites;dr4mr7a;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/
"I agree with the ""don't invest recklessly"" message. Strongly disagree with the comparisons to lottery tickets or roulette. And a lot else in here.

I find a lot of issue with you offering baseless valuations for future prices. ""If btc were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely falling apart. Based on what?

""On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13.""

Yeah, I'd hate to be the dumbass that bought at $1163. Yes, it's volatile, no one would disagree. Yes, you should only invest what you can afford to lose. But to compare it to casino gambling (provably, mathematically -EV) is disingenuous at best.

Bitcoin is doomed. It runs off an outdated rudimentary system which requires way too much electricity. It's only a matter of time before it tanks due to a major technical issue. Switch to LITECOIN which is like bitcoin but better with all necessary improvements. Sell off all your BTC and buy LTC cheap while you still can! I realized how shitty bitcoin was last week when my 5k transaction took almost a day and a half to confirm (I still have no idea why). I sold all $35k of my BTC and put 3/4 into litecoin and the other 1/4 into Ethereum and it's so much cleaner and more manageable if that makes any sense. I also just doubled my money with LTC in the last 24 hrs.

It is a little bit like saying in 2007 do not expect the whole world to join facebook. There is another possibility. This might be genuinely a beginning of a new financial era and people are slowly transitioning to it and what some see as a bubble might simply be an emerging new reality. You can say it is a bubble only if applying traditional criteria. Which is non-applicable. This is all brand new and anything can happen. Imagine saying all of this to someone when they wanted to buy 100 Bcs in 2009. I bet back then it was a bubble too. Remember - for the first time in history there is virtually no possibility for the global financial mobsters to rig this game.

"I think that your point is valid but it may confuse people.  

If someone holds 1 billion worth of coin they will not exit all at once.  They should sell slowly into an upswing as long as the volume is sufficient to absorb the selling.

If someone has 1 billion US cash dollars in North Korea they can't access the value immediately.  They have to ship/fly the money to the USA, try to find a buyer who wants to trade yuan(or bitcoin) for US dollars or slowly change it at cash exchanges while crossing the border with China.  In Russia they probably have similar challenges.

Andreas Antonopoulos had a talk where he pointed out that during the banking problems in India bitcoin had a significant premium over the Rupee.

Bitcoin is worth what you think it is worth (What are you willing to pay/risk to have $1,000 dollars of present value stored in a key you remember).  People probably bought in 2013 because they either wanted to own a cool new financial technology, they wanted to store value in a cryptocurrency or they were speculating that in time people would realize its true value.

"I realize that I'm a tech when I say this, but there's really no excuse for having your funds on an exchange rather than cold storage when sites like bitaddress.org exist and literally generate a wallet in seconds.

Here's the complexity though, (since I'm paranoid and want my funds impossible to breach through cyberattack) to use the highest degree of security, a wallet should be generated offline.  This is simply done by doing the following:

1. Go to bitaddress.org
2. Go to File > Save Page As > Save it to your desktop
3. Turn off WiFi and unplug ethernet so your computer is 100% offline.  Airplane mode can do this too
4. Open your saved webpage from your desktop
5. Generate your wallet by spinning your mouse around like a magical wizard, literally, you'll see
6. Print your wallet - Don't use a network printer (again, i'm super paranoid when it comes to my crypto investment portfolio)
7. Close your browser
8. Turn on WiFi/reconnect ethernet and you're done

Bitaddress generates the public and private key for Bitcoin wallets.  That piece of paper you printed should be kept very secure in a fireproof safe or similar.

"What are you implying, if only jokingly? Assange? Not quite but there is this...

>On 5 December 2010, just after VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, Amazon, and other financial companies started denying service to WikiLeaks, a debate broke out on the official web forum for Bitcoin about the risk that donations to WikiLeaks using Bitcoin could provoke unwanted government interest in the then nascent crypto-currency. ‘Basically, bring it on,’ wrote one poster. ‘Satoshi Nakamoto,’ the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, responded: ‘No, don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.’ See the post on the Bitcoin Forum: archive.today/Gvonb#msg26999. Six days later, on 12 December 2010, Satoshi famously vanished from the Bitcoin community, but not before posting this message: ‘It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.’ See the post on the Bitcoin Forum: archive.today/XuHCD#selection-1803.0-1802.1.

>In agreement with Satoshi’s analysis, Assange and Wikileaks decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established. This decision may have saved Bitcoin from premature death in the cradle for too much unfriendly media attention too soon.

"Very few that come to mind. Ethereum is, IMO, the only possible contender. Most everything else is too derivative of bitcoin (not different enough to succeed if bitcoin fails), or too niche.

And just recently Ethereum started having scaling issues due to CryptoKitties, haha. A recent thread on /r/ethereum about trying to get Steam to support it instead of bitcoin had an interesting top-voted objection: the network wouldn't be able to handle the demand.

Seems like we're all in this boat together. Forking a coin and slightly changing it will solve nothing, and the scaling solutions being worked on for both Bitcoin and Ethereum are strangely similar... gee I wonder why? ;)

From an economic point of view, a cryptocurrency might do better if it had a well known *perpetually inflationary* schedule, used a perfected proof of stake mining system, implemented lightning and side chains, and permitted confidential transactions. But this doesn't mean bitcoin won't succeed without all of those things... just that if you want to dethrone bitcoin, you need to do better.

"If you understand how Islamic rulings work - you'll know why there isn't a unanimous decision.

The rulings tend to come from precedent and deductive analogies. Depending on how they're presented with it - they'll be more likely to sway one way or another. Also, each person has their own biases and methodology of how they derive judgement (fatwa) - some would weigh precedent of immediate Successors of the Prophet's generation more than rulings of later Scholars. Others outright reject deductive analogy and say everything is Halal (permissible) until clearly proven Haram (prohibited) etc. That's just the surface...

There's also corruption - people who are directly/indirectly benefiting from giving Fatwas by those asked or ""Fatwa-Shoppers"" - people who ask as many scholars as needed until they get the answer they want and run with it.";1;0;False;conatus_or_coitus;dr422dp;Muslim clerics just declared that owning bitcoin was compatible with Islam.

"Mosaic Law forbade usury but Mosaic law was fulfilled when Christ was born. That is part of the reason ""an eye for an eye"" was replaced with ""love thine enemy"". 
If you have any examples of Christ mentioning usury specifically in the New Testament, I'd be interested in learning about it. 
Christ also taught us to be profitable. 

""14 ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, whocalled his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.

17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.

19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thougood and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.

26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.

29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be takenaway even that which he hath.

30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.""

Nobody really knew, and I'd challenge anyone to find posts from 2012 here that were making sound predictions of bitcoin in 5 years.

True, but there's nothing to stop bitcoin from going to 1 million, 5 million or even 10 million per coin.

"When you zoom out overall, it looks like bitcoin is clearly going parabolic.

">Stabilization in the context of Bitcoin is not having these wild 10%+ daily swings and settling (better word than stabilizing?) at like +5% yearly rate in relation to fiat nominal value.

Well you can say the rate of deflation can stabilize but that will mean the price itself will not stabilize, which is what I assume people are referring to when they defend deflation by saying at some point the price of bitcoin will level off and thats when people will start using it as currency.

This is why I try to point out to people that the price can literally never stop increasing.

The incentive to hoard bitcoin will never disappear so long as it keeps deflating, and it will start deflating exponentially more as supply rate continues to halve. The only thing that could save it from hyper-deflation is if economic growth ground to a halt and started slowly reversing, which would not be a good thing.

>Yes, it is. It's a computer network protocol, which can be changed at will. But this requires a hard fork with broad consensus or you'll just get another ""Bcash"".
 
I mean this is true but I don't see how it negates any of the points I made about artificial scarcity.

The most useful currency is the one that generates the most wealth. Currency only generates wealth by facilitating trade, money that never exchanges hands provides no value at all. Artificial scarcity of currency actively discourages trade, and facilitates rent-seeking. 

Supply of currency needs to scale with demand for currency to avoid this.

There is nothing I can say. You literally lack even a rudimentary level of economics so trying to explain them to you is literally worse than explaining to a high schooler, because you're an adult, presumably. Or you are *literally* a child, which wouldn't surprise me that much.

You abuse words and acronyms without knowing what they are or what they mean, contradict yourself, confuse concepts, blatantly misapply terms, and then ignore what's actually written. 

You want to actually discuss something related to economics? Try reading the page that I copied here from the paper. If you can actually figure that out (which would be rather impressive given your track record) I'll post you the other 10 pages.

Then maybe we can try having a discussion. Or, you can continue to ignore all the legitimate points, and then cry about how I don't make any, because your feeble mind literally turns itself off when it is contradicted.

See but those things happen for a lot of reasons. Banks also make more when they don't conduct predatory loans. Banks also don't want high risk clients as they want to make money off their investments. The 2008 crisis involved a lot of other pieces like people knowing they couldn't repay loans and a few laws that shouldn't have been there. I have no knowledge of countries outside the US so I'm not commenting on them, I can talk about US stuff, but predatory lending techniques are illegal here. ;1;0;False;marauder634;dr4vlw9;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
"I don't think you're following. I'm arguing there's no such thing as equality. It's a stupid childish notion that is not possible. We are not all genderless robots running the exact same program. We're all wired a bit differently with our own unique dreams and desires..  ergo we are all always going to go our own ways..  and therefore society can never be equal. Some are always going to be more resourceful and more ambitious with greater propensity for risk than others resulting in unequal outcomes.

So your beef with Bitcoin not solving your contrived issue of equality is completely moot. Your parents and your teachers failed to educate you in the most basic area of life, that we are not equal and never will be. If Bitcoin goes tits up, there will be no bailout. You decide if you want to take that risk or not.

> Hello, fellow Bitcoiners.
> 
> Like a lot of you, I've been been following Bitcoin for quite some time now. What I've always found the most entertaining property of cryptocurrency is how it exposes the massive economic illiteracy among the so-called financial journalists and, indeed, a large portion of the financial elite and even quite a few prominent economists.
> 
> Having said that, I want to arm my fellow Bitcoin users with a small amount of knowledge that should be enough to knock out the most widely held objection to cryptocurrency's value that you would encounter from your families, friends and acquaintances: the idea that money needs to be 'backed' by something, whether it's a financial institution, an army or just plain belief in it. The simple fact is that this isn't true now, has never been true, and will never be true.
> 
> Money is valuable because it is the simplest, most efficient and most effective way of signalling economic data across large groups of people. A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
> 
> * 1) easy to use and understand by everyone
> * 2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
> * 3) neglegible in overhead costs
> 
> Cryptocurrency is a happy marriage of information technology improving n°1 and distributed cryptology improving n°2, while SegWit and Lightning continue to improve on n°3. Put simply, in terms most educated people can understand: **Bitcoin has value because it is better at acting as an information carrier for economic data than any traditional currency.** It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can. This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar until all fiat currency has collapsed around it.
> 
> Good money, in short, is all about reliably transferring economic preferences.

Thats not entirely correct. The price is also going up because Bitcoin is deflational and there are only 21 million available. If everybody wants to have Bitcoin, it is sure to go up. I think at some point of time the Bitcoin will stagnate and when that time comes it is going to be a great currency. Also there are already countries regulary using Bitcoin. Korea for example. And the thing with security is that with bitcoin you have to care about security yourself and can't let a bank do it and I don't think this is bad. There are many ways to store them without them getting stolen.

The economic growth in the last half of the 20th century was higher than the first half. The worst depression in US history happened because of rapid deflation. I don't know what else to tell you.

You asked if the economy could keep expanding under the gold standard and I provided evidence that it couldn't because it limited the money supply and caused an economic collapse from rapid deflation.

It takes a massive conspiracy theory to think that every country in the world that was on the gold standard got off it even though its better for the economy than fiat. Even isolated dictatorships like North Korea don't use the gold standard, and they have no reason to just follow what every other country of doing even if its worse for the economy.

>That is not losing faith in the gold standard. That is losing faith in the banking system. Has nothing to do with the gold standard.

The gold standard is a standard set up by the banking system that says gold will be redeemable with paper certificates. People lost confidence that paper would in fact be able to be redeemed for gold so people tried to redeem as much gold as possible before it was no longer possible and they were left with worthless paper.

I have no idea how else you would describe that other than a loss of confidence in the promise that paper can be redeemed for gold, or why that's the one line in my entire post you're objecting to, when everything else is a detailed description of the results of rapid monetary deflation.";1;1;False;suninabox;dr5mx3n;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

I can easily see Bitcoin going into a long winter after the current stream of get rich quick ""investors"" realizes that it's not ready for day to day use. 

During that long winter the people who really believe in the idea will keep improving it, maybe we'll have one or two more big scaling ideas developed that make it ready for mainstream worldwide use. 

Blockchain will be used in videogames and to trade digital magic the gathering cards and Pokémon, probably also a few other things that no one in mainstream media will take seriously because they don't understand technology and can only see how expensive the suit of whoever is talking about it is. 

Maybe one of the big scaling ideas will come from research done by a big videogame company. Everyone will have a laugh at how the cosmetics from game whatever can now scale to more users than that Bitcoin thing that was a fad a few years ago and some people still take seriously.

Bitcoin will keep working, those improvements will be implemented and during the next worldwide recession it will do better than nearly any other investment because it has already fallen after the bubble and the only people holding onto it are the ones who really see the value and potential of it.

It will come back with a vengeance after the recession ends and people rediscover it as a now very usable currency that didn't fall during the crisis.

Gold did well for thousands of years, until fractional reserve banking joined forces with two world wars and a lot of dumb government policies to bring us the great depression, which now gets blamed entirely on the gold standard when the problem was that banks didn't have the gold reserves they claimed. 

And yet this single, badly explained, data point is used as the reason why inflation is necessary.

Fun fact, the US was on the gold standard during the 40's, 50's and 60's, the best growth period the country has ever seen.

"> but you can say that for all appreciating assets. People are trying to grow their wealth (or at least preserve it) by investing in real property, stocks, bonds, gold, art, antiquities, music instruments, etc..

The difference is things like gold respond to supply and demand. Gold is never sold for less than it costs to dig out of the ground. Meaning when you buy a ton of gold this provides money for miners to mine another ton of gold. Supply is not fixed. We have more gold now than ever before.

You buying gold does not deprive other people of gold, it increases the total available amount of gold by increasing supply. Wealth is generated.

Buying up fixed assets does not increase supply, supply is fixed. [This leads to rent seeking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) Rent seeking is parasitic behavior that either creates no wealth or actively destroys wealth. It only makes one person as rich as it makes another person poor, unlike wealth creation which can make both people richer.

A classic example of this is a river toll. A man sets up a chain across a river and charges passing trading ships for permission to pass. While it makes the toll collector rich, it makes everyone else worse off. It slows ships so trade is less efficient, traders have to spend money on the toll which they could instead be using to buy more goods and services that create wealth, the toll operator himself is wasting time and resources collecting tolls instead of using those time and resources to create wealth.

Now the toll collector could say that they spent a lot of time and money on building the chain, researching which river would be the best to collect tolls on, so its only fair that he gets some compensation. They were the first person to come up with the idea to start a river toll so its only right their risk-taking innovation be rewarded.

They could also say that trading on the river is very profitable, the fee he charges is only small compared to the money they make from trading on the river, so the traders are making money by paying the toll.

All of this ignores than the toll collector is not actually providing anything of value, and that they're only making money by withholding access to a valuable resource.

Most rent seeking isn't this obvious, and its usually mixed with some level of wealth creation to disguise it, but any time you have a fixed resource you will have rent-seeking if its legally allowed and physically possible.";2;1;False;suninabox;dr5e0mp;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

">Money was no longer bound to gold and it took 2 years for germany to fuck up big times with the ""Reichsmark"" and create a hyperinflation in 1922

This wasn't some mistake or inherent problem with fiat, it was a deliberate attempt by the Weimar government to hyper-inflate the currency as an attempt to deal with the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles, mainly war reparations and the occupation of the Ruhr. They were running printing presses non-stop printing trillions of marks, they weren't somehow unaware of what this would do to the value of marks.

Germany would arguably have been more fucked if they hadn't hyper-inflated their currency, since collapsing the value of the currency got them out of a lot of debt because no one cared about collecting debt in a currency that wasn't worth anything.

The UK, US, and France eventually realized that destroying the German economy wasn't going to benefit them so they agreed to let a lot of debt go, and the focus changed from trying to punish Germany to trying to help their economy stabilize.

> The reason why gold isn't used anymore is because gold is 1. Heavy 2. You can't split it easily

None of those things matter since we started issuing paper certificates, and then digital records for currency. Gold was traded as paper for a long time before gold stopped being currency, before even the gold standard.

You can carry any amount of gold in paper as you want, and you can split it as much as you want. You can trade 0.00000000001 gold atom digitally if you wanted to.

">If only one nation is heavily using bitcoin as a currency, and bitcoin goes way up, that nation becomes very wealthy, because it has a much greater claim on the wealth of the entire world. Because they can trade their valuable bitcoins to other nations

If this was true Japan should be significantly richer than it was 20 years ago, since the yen is worth significantly more dollars and euros than it was 20 years ago. Now they can trade valuable Yen to other nations right?

Except Japan is poorer than it was 20 years ago even though the Yen is worth more than it was back then.

Because currency isn't wealth, its just a token for wealth, and just because tokens are more valuable doesn't mean you have more wealth. Tokens can increase in value whilst the total amount of wealth decreases and vice versa.

It's very simplistic logic that deflationists are operating on: that since money buys stuff, the more valuable money is the more stuff you will be able to own, so the richer you are. That logic works on the individual level, it doesn't work when you're talking about economies as a whole. That's as simplistic as thinking that having more money makes you richer, so if a country prints a bunch of money it will become richer. Printing a bunch of money might make you individually richer but its coming at the expense of others, no wealth is being created. Deflation might make individuals with money richer but it is not creating wealth.

The fact that your theory on how currency works doesn't match up with real world evidence should cause you to re-evaluate your theory rather than dismiss it as a stupid side issue.

>Bitcoin would have to stabilize before debt could be denominated in bitcoin.

As you wrote, he's **withholding access to a valuable resource** by setting up the chain - the river itself; and by doing this everyone else is worse off.  

What valuable resource am I withholding from everyone else by buying bitcoin and bitcoin going up in price afterwards? The bitcoin itself by not using it? Those who want to use it strictly as a currency, or rather as a medium of exchange can buy it and then immediately exchange it for whatever service/goods they require.

">Yes nowadays you can do it with gold but not at the time but I was talking about the past.

But there's a reason why we haven't returned to gold now we've solved those problems of using gold as a currency.

It's the same reason bitcoin isn't being used as a currency which is its too scarce to match demand for currency. 

If you don't increase supply of currency to match demand then it starts being profitable to hoard currency instead of to spend it. When no one spends it, no one is interested in accepting it, so it stops being a useful currency. Iron and copper are still used in coins after over 2,000 years. No one uses gold coins as currency because they're too valuable as gold to use as a coin.

When gold stopped being a currency it didn't become worthless because its still valuable for other reasons, mainly jewelry, and the fact it has no true substitutes. Currently bitcoin is only really valuable as a speculative asset. For all the talk of how it will be the currency of the future and lightning will fix everything, if someone replaced all your fiat money with bitcoin and didn't allow you to use fiat as an intermediary, you would struggle to do anything you needed to use money for. Most bitcoin users are buying to hold, not to use.

When bitcoin stops being a speculative asset, unlike gold it isn't useful for anything other than being valuable. The hope that when the speculative bubble ends bitcoin will somehow have transformed into a useful currency is a huge gamble given the underlying problems with both the technology and the economic utility of deflationary currency.

"Let me hold your hand through this like you're holding on to your bitcoins:

So /u/pointofyou said the following:

>Yes, the Gini Coefficient of BTC sucks. BUT, those who do hold it do so because they believed in the idea from the get go, going against what everyone else said. Often for ideological reasons. So it's reasonable to say they'll not just enjoy their wealth but also have a vested interest in making BTC work.

You see, the author here first tells you that he agrees there is a clear inequality in BTC holders. You can tell this is what the first sentence is about because the [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) is how economic disparity is measured by some. Then, he provides you with a counter-argument, the crux of which is to say that BTC ""one percenters"" (my words, not his) are different than fiat one percenters because of a fundamental ideological difference. Though this is the foundation of his argument, he builds on it by explicity stating that BTC one percenters would like to ""make BTC work."" This is clearly a subjective term, your idea of ""working"" is different than mine, but the definition of the word is not important in the context of my rebuttal to him:

> You could say the same about the US dollar, banks have a vested interest in making the USD work.

Here, I argue that much like BTC one percenters have a vested interest the BTC ""working,"" banks have a vested interest in the USD working. I'm drawing a parallel here. Notice--I did not say he was wrong, I simply stated that his argument is moot because he is implying some difference in the motivations of fiat one percenters and BTC one percenters, while I am saying they are all human, and as a group, will behave like all other humans. 

Go ahead, take a second to really let that sink in, you'll need it for this next part! 

Okay, got it? Great! You're doing just fine. :)

Following my comment, /u/pointofyou replied:

>By ""making it work"" I meant that they want more people to get it and will behave more benevolent. This would be in line with their philosophy. For example sending BTC to oppressed political groups in Venezuela or so.

So we have another piece of the puzzle here. The author is now illustrating what his idea of BTC ""working"" would entail. As you read the rest of his quote, you have to remember that we assume he's talking about BTC one percenters because it would be logical to continue talking about the same people you've been talking about thus far unless otherwise stated. Anyway, the author claims that the BTC one percenters want more people to have BTC because of their [kindness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/benevolence). He then illustrates the types of things these one percenters may do, such as send BTC to oppressed peoples. 

With me so far? Buckle up, we're going to start getting into the weeds here!

I replied:

>Oh I see, you think that people who own Bitcoin are a new breed that don't have self-interest and common human motivations.... Right.... Quick, get out of the way, let me throw all my savings at Bitcoin....

Here, I made use of a seldom used literary technique known as ""sarcasm,"" which some of the more advanced readers can spot by my excessive use of ellipses and overall tone of argument. As such, you have to assume the things I argued here are *counter* to the point I am actually trying to make. Therefore, since I said that BTC owners *are* a new breed that *don't* have self-interest and common human motivations, you have to assume that what I'm *actually* saying is that they *are not* a new breed and they *do* have the same self-interest and motivations. 

Feel free to stretch your legs at this point, I know that last bit was tough to get through.

So to quickly summarize our argument:

>**OP**: BTC rich people want their currency to ""work""

>**Me**: So do normal rich people

>**OP**: BTC rich people have different ideals and so they will want more people to have BTC and may even send some to oppressed people

>**Me [sans-sarcasm]:** No, BTC rich people and normal rich people will behave the same because that's what groups of people do

Now this is where *you* jumped into the argument and said:

>Way to have a little faith in people. Please.. feel free to dabble in the alt market since you know so much. Or even better... Go and start your own ""humanitarian coin""... please please go save the world and the children and the trees.. please save us all from ourselves.

This was tough for me to decipher, and do you know why? Your first sentence states that I do not have faith in people, yet your next few sentences tell me to start a ""humanitarian coin,"" which, most would argue, requires faith in people (not only to carry out some humanitarian task, but to adopt the coin). You can see my confusion here--do I not have faith in people, or do I?

Regardless, I didn't want to argue semantics, so I ""read between the lines"" and followed up with:

>I don't see how you can have faith in people who hold huge amounts of bitcoin any more than you can in banks and the Fed, but please, enlighten me. Is bitcoin somehow selecting for a better breed of human beings? Was this implemented in a later version or has it been there since the white paper?

Here, I argue that the motivations of normal rich people and BTC rich people will be the same, and so they are likely to act in the same fashion, despite what one may claim about ideological differences. Then I followed up with some more sarcasm, but see if you can decipher it on your own!

You followed up with a counter-argument (though I use that term loosely here):

>Even if you do a perfect airdrop perfectly distributing the exact same number of coins to every person on the planet. You will not achieve your communist dream of a perfectly equal society. Some people will buy drugs while others will invest in themselves or a business... and then eventually you'll come full circle to where we are today. how on earth do you propose on maintaining perfect equality? Go on.. explain. You can't because it is impossible to control the actions of everyone. But for some reason you believe it is your right to exert control over others because Communism. Grow the fuck up...

Any normal reader now may be confused because you imply in your comment that I have been arguing *for* communism or some sort of equality drenched utopia (feel free to look up that word if you need to). Yet, not only did I never argue *for* equality, I explicitly stated, several times, that BTC will not achieve any sort of ""equality"" in the same way that fiat currency cannot do so. Are you with me?

Go ahead and just sleep on all of this tonight and really internalize it. Once you do that, I think you'll come to the same conclusion I came to: you're a fucking dumbass.

">Would you say the same thing about the gold standard? If the world adopted the gold standard, do you think that would make economic expansion impossible? 

It already did, and that's without the supply of gold being fixed.

During the great depression there was sharp monetary contraction, a 35% decrease, which caused 33% price deflation.

This completely fucked the economy. The Federal reserve could not print any more money because they had already hit the limit allowed by the gold standard and they didn't have any more gold.

All the problems of rapid monetary deflation I warned about in this thread already happened during the Great Depression. Demand for goods and services dropped significantly since it was more profitable to keep hold of money than to spend it. investment in business dropped for similar reasons, along with the increased difficulty of borrowing money. currency hoarding further exacerbated the monetary contraction. there was a huge number of loan defaults and banks stopped lending money which exacerbated the drop in consumer demand and reduced investment in business. A lot of the money supply existed as debt so widespread defaults exacerbated the monetary contraction.Employers went out of business, so people lost their jobs, which meant there was even less demand for goods and services because people weren't getting paid. Banks started going out of business because they lost so much revenue from loan defaults, people started pulling money out of banks because they were worried about losing it which put even more banks out of business. 1/3rd of all banks at the time went out of business. People lost faith in the gold standard and started cashing in paper certificates for gold, which made the monetary deflation even worse since for each dollar of gold they lost they had to pull multiple paper dollars out of circulation.

">The price of the bitcoin is really of no concern to them - what do they care if they get .00005 or 0.5 BTC for $100? They require $100 worth of BTC and this is what they get.

This would hold true if the quantity of wealth stayed static and so did bitcoin. In which case it wouldn't be possible to rent seek. Currency is a means of trading wealth, so the amount of currency needs to scale with the amount of wealth/trades. It's when it doesn't scale that artificial scarcity is induced and rent seeking can occur.

To super simplify it, if you add/destroy 1 currency for every 1 wealth you add/destroy, then currency will always be worth 1 wealth. You can't hope to gain wealth by hoarding currency because 1 currency is always worth 1 wealth.

The only use currency has in such a situation is to allow wealth generating and pareto optimizing trades (i.e. a trade allows more wealth to be generated, like selling seeds to a farmer, or it optimizes the existing distribution of wealth, i.e. I have more steel than I need but want corn, you have more corn than you need but want steel, we don't increase the amount of wealth but distribute existing wealth more efficiently).

When you limit the supply of currency (you add 1 wealth without adding 1 currency), then you induce scarcity and increase the relative value of currency. This means you can just hold currency whilst other people generate wealth and now buy more stuff because there is greater demand for currency. In fact the more currency you hoard, the more wealth you will gain, by dual effects of having more units of currency appreciating, whilst hoarding decreases supply and increases price.

This hoarding of scarce currency is the rent seeking. Rather than use the currency to generate wealth, you merely withhold it from supply, and then sell it on at an increased price. So you withhold currency from its wealth generating use to profit from its rent seeking use. This is how deflationary spirals happen, as the more currency is hoarded, the more profitable currency hoarding becomes relative to using it to generate wealth, until even the currency hoarders are worse off because there's so little wealth being generated and you can only redeem currency for existing wealth.

> What valuable resource am I withholding from everyone else by buying bitcoin and bitcoin going up in price afterwards?

The medium of exchange. It's not a perfect analogy because unlike a river toll, there's nothing to stop you from using a different medium of exchange which is why I don't believe a deflationary currency will ever develop past being a speculative asset. It's why even though BTC is meant to be a currency, the number 1 thing its traded for is dollars.

In practice deflationary currencies are abandoned via greshams law. Its why gold coins are no longer currency but copper and iron are still being used for over 2,000 years. If a currency gets so scarce that it becomes more valuable as an asset than as currency it just ceases to be used as currency.

The problem for bitcoin is that unlike gold it doesn't have any other underlying uses than currency.

"I agree there'll always be an incentive to hoarding bitcoin - but you can say that for all appreciating assets. People are trying to grow their wealth (or at least preserve it) by investing in real property, stocks, bonds,  gold, art, antiquities, music instruments, etc..  

This brings me to my main point. I don't see the value of bitcoin stemming from it being ""a currency"". A bitcoin (BTC, the unit that we move around the bitcoin network) is a digital currency - one that cannot be copied, one that you can verifiably transfer to someone else, one that cannot be forged. That's it. That's what bitcoin - the unit - is to me and that's why it's worth something. And in this context, bitcoin IS backed by something - the bitcoin network itself. How much this unit is worth in relation to other things/assets (how many dollars/euros it costs) is entirely up to the people to decide. 

I don't believe that BTC will replace any fiat currency, nor do i wish it does that. It can however co-exist alongside and function as a ""store of value"" (due to it's  deflationary nature) and as a medium of exchange that closely mimics a physical exchange on a digital level (you hand over a bitcoin to someone, like people have been handing over shells, salt, grains of gold, coins and paper for centuries).

"> And I'm not clear why divorcing security from electoral politics is supposed to be a good thing.

You don't really need to vote every 4 years on whether rape, murder arson and kidnapping is legally defensible. 

A private law enforcement market based on these fundamental protections gives a private citizen regardless of race, gender, political affiliation or religion access the same security services and outcomes that the wealthy minority enjoy. In this scenario, even if your private security service fails you, the market will have competitors willing to close the gap. In every way possible, having a competitive market gives back power to the consumer. 

I think somewhere down the line, we forget that we are geographically locked into our security provider. A Japanese citizen has limited access to the American security complex, even wealthy Japanese. This creates an imbalance in outcomes and encourages whoever runs the current administration in your country, to deny or provide security and determine the level of threat on your behalf.

The only price bitcoin can stabilize at is 0. It's hard-coded for hyper-deflation. Supply halves at regular intervals, eventually supply will reverse since bitcoins will be lost faster than they're made. The only way it could stabilize above 0 is if the amount of wealth on earth happened to decrease at the same rate as the amount of bitcoin, and even then eventually there would be 0 wealth so bitcoin would also be worth 0

"Your post is great man. Although something to keep in mind about when you mentioned you'd feel more comfortable with your money in a bank account because it won't get hacked, stolen etc etc. 

The private key algorithm is quantum proof hard. Think about every grain of sand on earth and being able to put all your money in the 1 grain anywhere on the planet and then asking someone to find it (in this case it would be a quantum computer).

From that perspective I feel safer having my money stored in bitcoin 100% more secure over a centralized bank account.

>Gold isn't a currency, most demand comes from the jewelry industry.

Bitcoin isn't a currency per se either. The bitcoin system is a computer protocol and a BTC is a digital record in this system. What function people assign to it, is entirely up to the people. Most industrial demand for gold comes from jewelry and tech manufacturers, but that's not what dictates gold's price nowadays.

>It goes up in value because lots of people want it and its naturally scarce and expensive to get out of the ground. Eventually asteroid mining will be able to flood the market with gold and everyone will have as much gold as they like.

This is a non-argument against bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up in value for the same reasons - lots of people want it (for different reasons/motivation), it's ""naturally scarce"" and it's hard to produce (only by mining). However, unlike gold, there's not gonna be any asteroid mining of bitcoin in the future so not everyone will have as much as they like (this likely won't happen with gold either, because the miners will keep it artifically scarce, just like they do with diamonds).

>That's far better than bitcoin losing 80% of its value in a year.

Agreed, but it's still a huge price swing. I think most of us who believe in the positive attributes of bitcoin wish for less volatily (that's why i mentioned price stabilization in my previous reply).

"> That is exactly backwards. Such a country would now be the richest country in the world.

Just like in the great depression where they had 35% deflation and everyone got 35% richer?

you're still thinking of bitcoin like an asset, so the more you have the richer you are. That's an individual way of looking at it.

currency doesn't work like that. If you double the amount of dollars in the country, is everyone twice as rich and can buy twice as much? No, because then evil inflation would mean each dollar buys less.

Okay then, lets deflate instead. lets halve the amount of dollars in the world, the value of the dollar would double! Does that mean everyone in the US could now buy twice as much stuff? No, because there are half as many dollars.

Currency is just a token for wealth. If you double or halve the amount of tokens you haven't doubled or halved the amount of wealth just because the value of the token doubles or halves. It's only a medium of exchange, it has no intrinsic value.

1000% deflation would mean every single loan in the nation would increase 1000% in value and monthly repayments. Everyone with a mortgage would default. Every industry that relied on debt (which is all of them) would crash. Millions of people would lose their job and become homeless.

No one would buy anything but the bare essentials for survival because they could buy twice as much if they just waited a couple of months. So demand for goods and services plummet, so companies go out of business, so people lose their job, so people no longer get paid money to buy stuff, so even more companies go out of business.

Hyper-deflation is just as devastating for an economy as hyper-inflation.

>That literally can't happen.

I was being sarcastic, I hoped it was obvious that it can't go up 1000% a year forever. I was pointing out how bitcoins growth is unsustainable and destined to crash because its fueled by speculation and artificial scarcity.

"The reason why gold isn't used anymore is because gold is

3. You can fake it

Because at the beginning that money was like a proof for you to posess gold. It was called the gold standard. In the 1920s the cantral banks world wide abandoned this concept meaning that behind the money was only the trust in people that others would accept it as ""money"". Thus fiat was born. Money was no longer bound to gold and it took 2 years for germany to fuck up big times with the ""Reichsmark"" and create a hyperinflation in 1922.

">Wut?

I'd suggest asking a better question if you want to understand why a currency with a fixed cap, a gradual loss rate and no recovery mechanism can't stabilize long term. 

> it's ""naturally scarce"" and it's hard to produce (only by mining)

It's artificially scarce. There's a cap put on the number of bitcoins there can ever be. That's an artificial cap. That cap could have been set at 20 trillion or no cap at all. It's literally the definition of artificial scarcity.

The supply rate is also artificially scarce. A bitcoin is not the product of work, a block is, and the amount of bitcoins awarded by the block is dictated by the protocol. They could have decided to award 21,000,000 coins for the first block, or 0 coins, or double the amount of coins rewarded every block.

It's no more naturally scarce than any fiat currency, there will be as much or as little of it as we decide there will be, the cost of creating it is basically 0, its the cost of typing numbers into a computer.

It's a classic error by deflationists to think scarcity is actually desirable because it makes things more (relatively) valuable. We want as many valuable things as possible, we want asteroid mining to make gold as cheap as possible (everyone but gold hoarders that is). Currency is not wealth, its just a token for wealth, and the only people who benefit from insufficient supply of currency is people attempting to rent seek via hoarding access to a medium of exchange.

Currency is a means of trading wealth which means you need to increase the amount of currency as the amount of wealth increases otherwise it allows people to rent-seek wealth without producing anything of value.

">People shouldn't do that for a very, very long time. And nobody is, and nobody is going to.

Facilitating debt is a crucial use of currency in the modern economy. It's extremely sub-optimal not to let business to borrow money to invest.

If a company needs $10,000,000 to build a factory that will produce $2,000,000 of wealth per year, its a huge opportunity cost for them to have to save for 10 years to build that factory, when that factory could pay for itself in that time if you loaned the money up front.

That means no country will be able to adopt it as a mainstream currency for a ""very, very long time"", because basically every country of any size relies on debt to function.

>Doesn't make your overall argument correct.

Well you didn't address the main point of that argument which is that currency isn't wealth, and just because currency you increase or decrease the amount of currency it doesn't increase or decrease the amount of wealth.

Deflation allows people to accumulate wealth by hoarding currency which discourages trade and collapses the economy. Currency only generates wealth via facilitating trade, 1000% deflation guarantees as little trade as possible will happen, and since currency is only valuable relative to the quantity of wealth it represents this is ultimately self destructive.

It's a category error to think that because if you as an individual own bitcoin and it goes up in value that makes you richer, than if all of society owns bitcoins and it goes up in value then everyone is richer.

Currency going up or down in value doesn't increase or decrease the amount of wealth in the world, it just changes the relative value of currency to that wealth. And if you make currency far more valuable than all other forms of wealth then people stop trying to produce those forms of wealth and just focus on getting as much currency as possible.

30% annual deflation is enough to seriously cripple an economy if its not resolved quickly. 1000% would destroy any economy on earth.

"Not a savage takedown at all. More like a redditor who has put their thinking cap on but are missing out on crucial parts of knowledge or had a lack of consideration for a fuller ranger of variables.


1. Nothing is inherently easy to use and understood by everyone when first introduced. Take the computer for example. Do most people know how computers are built from the lowest abstractions? Probably not. But as the generations grow up with computers they start learning the patterns. In the case of Bitcoin this will only be more likely as it rests on a lower level than computers. Takeaway: Bitcoin is still young but eventually we become 'easy' to use and 'understood' by everyone.

2. You're completely neglecting the fact that inflation used under certain circumstances can be used to ""disappear"" money within banks. In a much more clever and stealthy manner I might add. What's actually more interesting is that in the case of Bitcoin, the 'value' in the sense of Bitcoin does not disappear (21 million). Whereas in the case of USD and most fiat-currencies... it does due to inflation. 1 Bitcoin stolen = 1 Bitcoin still. 1 USD inflated != non-inflated 1 USD.

3. Misunderstanding how decentralization and how decentralization layers instead of a full on decentralization scheme is a good technical solution. Lightning provides acts as a merchant layer. It's important to consider it under that perspective.

4. Really? ""Nobody"" wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin? Come on... there's a meme that proves this to be false. Is there regret? Yea, but this is the whole thing people don't get. There aren't that many Bitcoin whales out there. Those who are whales and held did their duty and deserve their reward.

5. Right... let's be realistic here. Sitting cash is a liability because of inflation. That pretty much disproves your entire point. You get to choose between various assets (i.e investments) which Bitcoin can be (Bitcoin has multiple attributes, fuck off with the labeling autism)... in the end of the day... you don't hear USD millionaires and billionaires talking about how much liquid cash they have. When they buy something... guess what? They take up a loan through their assets. They have assets instead of cash liabilities because that's how this current economic system works. What you're essentially arguing is that it makes more sense to let your money sit in a bank and decay. While this is a viable strategy under certain circumstances... good luck growing your wealth.

6. Bitcoin isn't denominated by BTC/USD. Take a look at any exchange and you'll realize that is not true. Is it the most common way to compare the change in its value? Yea... why? Because when you seek to compare differences... you need relativity.

"> I'd suggest asking a better question if you want to understand why a currency with a fixed cap, a gradual loss rate and no recovery mechanism can't stabilize long term. 

""Wut"" was in reference to you claiming it can only stabilize at 0. I'm not thinking/expecting it to stabilize absolutely (there's no absolutes in social/human sciences anyway). Stabilization in the context of Bitcoin is not having these wild 10%+ daily swings and settling (better word than stabilizing?) at like +5% yearly rate in relation to fiat nominal value.

"Nice post, but I think it's overly pessimistic about Bitcoin.

>It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value

It's an unreliable store of value now because crypto is new and it's very uncertain which crypto will 'win.' Even if we somehow knew BTC would win, there's also a lot of uncertainty about what winning looks like. So all prices are dominated by expected prices far into the future, multiplied by some probability that the coin will reach that price. 

For example, Bitcoin's price of $17k might reflect a 10% chance that it will be worth $170k in some number of years. Any new development that changes that probability to 8% or 12% will wildly swing the price. 

In the future we'll more understand how cryptocurrencies work, how strong their network effects are, which features and use cases are important, etc. Some cryptos will also have come much closer to their saturation point. This will significantly reduce volatility.

In the long run if Bitcoin succeeds its price will grow roughly in line with gross world product, or total global wealth (depending on whether it gets used more as a currency replacement or gold replacement), which would make it a pretty good store of value.

>Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways

Calling these things fundamentally unfixable is a huge overstatement.

Transaction fees: Higher layer solutions (like Lightning) plus some amount of on-chain scaling, plus sidechains with proofs of validity (not here yet but not impossible) can bring fees down a lot.

Energy usage: The problem now is that energy spent on mining is a function almost entirely of BTC price, not on how much security the network needs (although these things are loosely correlated). However in the future as the block subsidy becomes a smaller portion of the overall miner reward, security will depend on total transaction fees which will correlate more with how much security is actually needed.

Validation waits: This can be solved with things similar to BitGo Instant, and is also not an issue on Lightning. 

Wallet protection: This is rough right now, but I'm not sure why you think infrastructure built up around Bitcoin can't solve this. Your claim is that Bitcoin is fundamentally unable to address this, not just that it sucks now.

Exchange with existing infrastructure: Same comment as above. I see no reason why Bitcoin is somehow fundamentally unable to be exchanged well for traditional currency, whereas some other currency would somehow be better. Coinbase already offers a pretty decent service, and crypto-fiat conversion will only get smoother as the industry matures.

"You obviously know what you're talking about, to a much greater extent than I do, and you tempered my enthusiasm about BTC quite a bit here. I wanted to make two points though:

> US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

I just wanted to point out that Chartalism is a controversial theory of money creation and is not at all uncontroversial or even the most prevalent. You have perhaps unintentionally presented this as if it's a fact.

This seems a weird example to use given that it is widely known that an essentially analogous situation has already happened with electric cars, even involving specifically the company you name.

"Net Neutrality has always existed before Title I. However, in 2015, Verizon proved that Title I didn’t apply to ISPs, so they were moved to Title II to preserve the Net Neutrality that has always existed.

"North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

The nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. Investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene.

Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called ISIS, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

A report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

The FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the airwaves auction.

AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.";1;1;False;yottalogical;dr5kcmn;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!
