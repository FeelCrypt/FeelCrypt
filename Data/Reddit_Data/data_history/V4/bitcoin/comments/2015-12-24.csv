"Well, [they don't have far to go](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/the-worst-voter-turnout-in-72-years.html) to hit your 20% benchmark, but I really don't think it's going to open any more eyes than 2014's 36.3% already has. Maybe if they hung a few of the war criminals (Bush (either one), Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al.), or jailed more than a token crooked shyster or two now and again, the government would gain some credibility in the eyes of the electorate. Of course that will never happen, so I assume that America will follow in the footsteps of all over-expanded empires sooner or later, and my guess would be sooner.

The lies are already so transparent that they're adjusting the public school curriculum to prevent six-year-olds from calling them out; They've got everyone under mass surveillance so that they can cut the thought-criminals out of the herd easily; They've got rigged voting machines (Diebold), the ""electoral college"" that is not representative of the popular vote, and gerrymandered congressional districts to make sure that even when people do figure it out, they can't do anything about it anyway; They've militarized the police and planted 800 military bases in 70 countries (I've read that they're in twice as many and will have to look into the discrepancy) to keep the lid on all this; and the list goes on and on...

Other superpowers are already stepping up to fill the void: Russia is starting to clean up the Bushes' catastrophes in the Middle East, China's economy is overshadowing America's, and the BRICKS Alliance will soon be able to assure the international community that Wall Street's greed will never devastate the entire world's economy again. Washington has already plundered about as much of the rest of the world as it can, and it is turning inward, cannibalizing its own ""middle class"" (i.e. ""the 99%,"" as if 99% of the population could constitute a ""middle class"" in a capitalist system). There is no reason for that 99% to care about any of it, since there's nothing in it for them: Washington has been bought by the 1%, the game is rigged, and the best they can hope for is not to be starved to death while their lords and masters gorge themselves to death chanting ""greed is good.""

You think that when the voter turnout drops to 20%, it will magically open everyone's eyes, but I'm pretty sure that a lot of people's eyes are already open, and that's what's becoming the government's worst nightmare.";1;1;False;Chipzzz;cy9sx26;Edward Snowden on Twitter: Imagine if the government went after corruption as hard as it goes after guys who run filesharing sites.

It is on you to prove that the law was broken, which will be difficult for you as there isn't a single judge that has ruled any of the actions of the NSA have violated the Constitution of the United States, all you have is a judge sending it to a higher court to be told it didn't violate the constitution and some Lawyers trying and failing to argue that it violated the Constitution.

"I don't understand why you say ""not really"" since you're basically agreeing with what I'm saying.

In the US and in other similar democratic governments, a vast majority of politicians talk to the special interest groups because he believes those groups are what constitutes as his people and he is their representative in government.

What are corporations if they are not simply organizations that employs real people? If the big companies thrives, the economy and the people that work for those companies would thrive as well. So when the biggest employer of his city/district/state needs him to do something, he will listen and does his best to accommodate the request because it'll effects many many of his people. If that company threatens to close a factory in his district if he doesn't do things their way, he will capitulate at some point. Why shouldn't he talk to those lobbyists from companies?  A politicians would always returns a favor as long as it doesn't collide with his moral standing and core believes because returning a favor doesn't cost him anything personally, and he gets money and influence and power for himself which is what the politicians really want. 

A politician really doesn't care where the money come from because he'd screw over company A over company B as long as company B gives him more money. If suddenly, lobbyist group C comes along and can offers the politician even more money influence or power, he'd go with C in an instant and forget everything he ever promised A or B. At that point, A and B doesn't matter anymore because neither would be able to fulfill the politician's self interest like C can, and for the most part, that's the selection criteria for the politician as long as what he's doing doesn't interfere with his core believes. 

One in a while, an offer comes along that is so enticing and overwhelming that they overcomes the politicians' believe system, and politicians ends up doing things that's very different than what he believed in, but more commonly, a politician's core principals are pretty weak and he would go about doing practically anything and feel nothing. I say this because that's pretty much the only way a politician can becomes successful in the first place, it's what they do, it's how they got where they are.

"Our laws are shifted to spread wealth to the wealthy.

Lower taxes on capital gains and carried interest than wages.

Gains can be untaxed if reinvested, essentially an owner of a large portfolio can save taxes by buying into a larger portfolio.

Cuts in the estate tax.

Presently, you can gift someone $5,000,000 tax-free in a lifetime, not including the $14,000 you can gift tax-free per year on top of that.

Working people don't believe in unions anymore. But, rich people still believe in lawyers and managers who are trying to lowball employee wages.

Businesses (and by extension shareholders) receive tax incentives.

Many mining, drilling, or extraction businesses make money from public lands. Offshore drilling is public land. That land belongs to the people of the US. The resource rights belong to the people of the US. Companies have to pay us to use those lands... thanks to lobbying, the US is paid some of the lowest royalties in the world for public land exploitation.

"Your age is irrelevant, your comment is what I was responding to without any idea of what your age is.  Your comment is typical of angsty teens who have taken one or two political classes and think they understand now...

But those classes don't teach anything about how the world works.  Which is why I was able to tell you were a teen without any idea of who you were or how old you were.  Don't feel bad a lot of adults share your 19 yr old angsty view on life.

Freedom of speech is great, but just because you have a view on something doesn't allow you to ruin others day.  

The constitution doesn't protect your right to FORCE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO YOU... it protects your right to say what ever you want.  If you want to get your message out you cannot just fuck up every ones day so you can force your opinion on them.

If you cannot get your word out without breaking the law maybe people are ignoring you because they don't care about your problem.  They have that right to.  There are millions of ways to get your voice heard without infringing on the rights of others, if your message is one of value it will get out.

And sorry but the Constitution 100% was intended to protect the rights of a well organized militia to have a nuclear weapon... because the amendment is very clear... Organized groups are to be allowed to keep the same kind of armament (weapons) as the US military.  This was done to make sure that the military could never over through the government by force because the people were allowed to be equally armed as the government.

That is 100% what their intention was, now sure at the time they were talking Cannons and muskets but the point was clear, same weapons for the people that the military has so the military can never control the people (in a military coup) 

As for how successful mass surveillance is... I don't give a shit...

The constitution protects private things in your possession from being searched.... it does not protect things that you gave to others.  You lose the right to privacy the moment you give your information to a third party.  That third party can do what ever they want with it, including giving it to the government and there is nothing you can do about it.

All the ISP providers and phone carries etc freely give this information to the NSA as they want the government to continue to provide them with access to satellites etc.

Look at it this way, if a teacher went in your school bag and found a note, your rights would be violated. If you give a note to the teachers pet and the teachers pet gives the note to the teacher, your rights weren't violated.  

That is what is going on, there is ZERO protection for your internet traffic, nor your meta data because you are using a third party and they can do what ever they want with your information.  

You do realize that when you log onto the internet you are connecting your ""private stuff"" with 100's to 1000's of other peoples servers... nothing you do on these servers is private, no email, nothing.  None of it is protected by the Constitution...

You talk about how those that wrote the constitution didn't know about nuclear weapons... you are right which is why we cannot say anything is ""clearly what was intended"" because both our weapons and communication technology has gone WELL BEYOND their imaginations...

The constitution is a completely out dated piece of paper and while it is convenient far to many people simply want it to mean what ever THEY THINK IT SHOULD mean...

Literally... Organized militias should be allowed to build and store nuclear weapons as they are allowed to maintain the same armament as the US military (they should also have access to all secret military weapons projects)... And maybe literally it was intended that nothing on the internet or phone should be tracked to protect privacy...

But the you cannot say the words don't matter only the intention for one but not the other....

Because the intention was for militia groups to have nukes... and fuck that..

"Monopolies would be incredibly difficult to sustain in a free state environment.

A government can easily create the framework for a monopoly through *laws* (an opinion with a gun), coercion and the initiation of force. Without the claim of legal and moral legitimacy (of government law) behind your monopoly, anyone attempting to build and maintain a monopoly (in a free state) would have to use force that isn't perceived as legal or moral. This would be like a mafia or a gang, their attempt to establish a monopoly is steeped in competition. We also do not recognize a mafia or gang as having the moral right to initiate force against us. Violence is expensive and in a free market environment, those using violence will find it very difficult to compete with those not using violence. The only reason violence is profitable for a government is because it's funded through coercion and theft.

Attaining 100% monopoly would be incredibly hard in a pure, free-market environment. Even if Amazon.com starts using thousands of drones to make delivery faster and easier, people will still find reasons to stop at other stores and pick things up.

Furthermore, if a voluntary company or structure amassed a massive near-monopoly on some service in a voluntary manner, it might not be terrible. And if such a natural monopoly (formed over time through voluntary interaction and no issuance of force) started treating people poorly or stumbled on it's productivity, then that monopoly would soon end. They could only maintain their monopoly until a new group of human beings found a way to do their job, or perform their service, faster, cheaper and more efficiently. Using force against their customers would backfire quite terribly. How would you react if employees at Best Buy started using violence to try and get you to buy a new TV? How many days of that until no one ever shops at their stores again. 

The violence on the state level works only because the majority of people believe in the government's assertion that they have a moral right to initiate force and violence against them.

When both parties agree on war and money and civil rights (now that gay marriage isn't a thing. Decided in the courts I might add) you know you have a fake debate and useless political discourse.

Sanders and all Republicans are super anti immigration.

Clinton and all Republicans are all super pro war.

No real conversation on the economy that is either reality based or even semi educated.

I agree with most of what you said. However, I can't really see how it's the voter's fault if they were being lied to. Wouldn't that put the root cause in the hands of the liars? Seems to me that the average voter needs to become aware of the constant stream of lies flowing out of Washington (and most of its orifices) for anything to truly change. Turn off your television. Get rid of that piece of garbage before it completely brainwashes you and your loved ones. Sources of honest information are incredibly widespread nowadays, and so are sources of lies to a similar degree. People have the ability to know truth, yet they can still go down a rabbit hole of lies.

"Originally you said that with respect to bulk collection, ""it is far more complex"" an issue than simply being ""clearly against the spirit of the 4th Amendment,"" and I questioned you, saying ""I don't see what interpretive approach one could take to that text whereby collecting everything a person says or does and storing it up until you want to look at can be seen as consistent with [the 4th amendment's] dictum.""

You chose not to address that question in any substantive way, and simply made some sweeping and unsubstantiated assertions (e.g. ""The Constitution does not protect the search of third party transactions,"" ""The NSA isn't collecting the info"") and concluded by saying ""if you call [bulk collection] unconstitutional you are just ignorant.""

I have cited three extremely qualified legal minds that assert exactly that. 

Again, you fail to address this and simply point out that no federal judge has ruled bulk collection unconstitutional. The ruling I cited, Klayman v Obama, granted (but stayed) a preliminary injunction on the bulk collection program. To reach that decision, Judge Leon had to consider if the plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, if the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury without an injunction, if other parties would be substantially injured by an injunction, and if it would further the public interest. He found in the affirmative on all of these questions. 

The question of substantial likelihood of success turned on these questions - is bulk collection and analysis a search, and is there a substantial likelihood that the search will be found unconstitutional. Quoting the section titles, ""the collection and analysis of telephony metadata constitutes a search,"" and ""there is a significant likelihood that plaintiffs will succeed in showing that the searches are unreasonable."" In particular, ""plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that their privacy interests outweigh the Government's interest in collecting and analyzing bulk telephony metadata and therefore the NSA's bulk collection is indeed an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment."" 

You claimed that I simply read the headline and ""misrepresent the truth and [...] run with it,"" when in fact I said that ""federal judge calls NSA bulk collection unconstitutional.""  I suggest you read [the ruling](https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2013cv00851/160387/48) yourself, it's a good discussion of the legal issues, and is replete with excellent quotes as well. 

So now that we've established that you are wrong to say that it is a ""lot more complex"" than simply applying the Fourth Amendment to bulk collection and finding it unreasonable, and also that you are wrong to say ""if you call it unconstitutional you are just ignorant,"" and that you were wrong to say that I ""misrepresent[ed] the truth"" about the ruling, perhaps you would like to make even one single claim or statement about this issue with even one supporting reference? Each time I've addressed your comments, you've simply moved the goalposts and changed the subject, and you have yet to support your outlandish claims in any way.

"> If you cannot get your word out without breaking the law maybe people are ignoring you because they don't care about your problem. They have that right to. There are millions of ways to get your voice heard without infringing on the rights of others, if your message is one of value it will get out.

There are a million ways if you have money. You can pay for advertisement and such. Sure, you can start an organization, but that's a lot of overhead for issues that need to be addressed as quickly as possible. And ""breaking the law"" is a bit too rigid. Civil Rights activists in the United States and Anti-Nazi protesters in Nazi German both broke the law during their activities, but that doesn't make them bad. And no, you can't force people to listen, but you should at least have the opportunity to be heard by as many people, who might be interested in what you have to say, as possible.

I also understand what you're saying about the militia, and I agree that the constitution is too outdated to be used for many modern scenarios; but... it's one of the few things that can be used to argue such points because everyone knows it. I could have also used the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a much more modern document, to argue the importance of the right of privacy.

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

And yes. I get that you give up your right to privacy as soon as you log into Facebook or even start up Windows. And that even ISPs own your data, but in that case, there's really no alternative. That's like installing cameras into every building in the nation and telling people that they can just live on the streets if they don't like it, because you put yourself and your possessions into a house that doesn't belong to you.

Now, surveillance itself isn't too bad, because it encourages people to get better at encryption. After all, you can't complain about someone snooping around in your home if you don't have a lock on your door. However, now they're going after locks and will most likely try to make locks without master keys illegal.
