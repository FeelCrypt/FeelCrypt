I would say of investments that have been around 10 years, Bitcoin is probably one of the most risky, and the most rewarding. I mean without leverage. Its just nothing like stocks or real estate, it does its own thing. They call it pure TA, since there is no earnings or rent to confuse the issue.

First time I heard of bitcoin it was $75. Thought it was expensive back then and carried on partly because I could not understand the whole concept behind it. Then you see the huge price movements and it starts getting your attention. Hind sight is always 20/20 though. Guess it's a matter of beleiving or not. If the trend is to continue it can easily go to 100k and more from here so even at 11k is worthed.
