"extrinsic and intrinsic value regarding future cash flows is an adaptation of what intrinsic actually means, and isn't what's being discussed with regards to bitcoin.

Extrinsic value in terms of derivatives simply measure time decay and moneyness. Theta and delta. Those objects exist on bitcoin futures, or options on futures, if they had them. However, the definition of intrinsic value being debated here is as it relates to currency.

Does gold, or the US dollar, have intrensic value? Yes, but not because the paper it's printed on is worth that much, or because gold is really used that much in electronics.

"Because money represents the wealth of a society. If there's a fixed amount of it, then the value of money necessarily increases over time. 

This sounds like it might be fine, but it actually isn't. It's classic deflation, which leads to various well known problems, a primary one being that people tend to hoard currency, expecting it to go up in value. This has various negative effects on an economy, since it inhibits spending and other kinds of investment.

One of the functions good central banks perform is to make sure that both inflation and deflation are kept under control. Too much movement in either direction tend to have negative effects.

"That's all well and true...but misapplied to the situation.

I'm well aware that using these tools, we can broadly say that people are satisficers and respond to incentives and make decisions at the margin.

But statistical analysis is only narrowly useful to the claim being made, as it does not account for the individuals (which it must in this case) who, though possibly statistically insignificant (though I don't think that you are understanding how many other common situations in which people, thinking on the margin!, do not value food or water; such that it might actually be statistically significant at any given time), clearly don't value even these life-sustaining goods. 

In other words, the existence of even one person who does not value them, falsifies the claim that some value is ""intrinsic"", which implies an inward or naturally occurring property of a thing. And that is largely what people are saying here when they use that word: they are *not* simply saying that most people at most times will value food and air and water, thus we can bank on those things...otherwise they would make that the important factor, but they weren't, they were getting in to a philosophical debate about the nature of value.

Econ is my hobby actually; but statistical analysis of what large groups of people presently value on net, can't explain well why one day, black tar-like stuff coming out of the ground is a nuisance, and the next day one of the most valued commodities on earth. Understanding people's decisions also along individualist lines and the completely subjective nature of human valuations, can. Don't get so caught up in modern empirical tools, that you think static pictures of an economy are a complete picture; you tend to lose the dynamism which is there in entrepreneurial activities, and even the big changes which have come from those statistically insignificant people who didn't just think at the margin, but factored in the past, and thought more than one step ahead.";1;0;False;kwanijml;dy810d7;Value is always in the eyes of the beholder;8fmasd;https://i.redd.it/y6n54dyjfpu01.jpg

"At one point XT had major support but never had majority support. Same with BU. Certainly neither had a *super majority* of support, or they would have forked. BIP 141 (Segregated Witness) required such a super majority to activate (95%). However BIP 91 (which was identical to BIP 141 reduced the threshold to 80%. **Over 80% of miners supported BIP 91, that's why and how it activated, that's why we have Segwit.** You saying ""Prior to SW2X SW BIP voting had somewhere around 20% support"" that's off by over 100%, there was more than twice that.

"> Yeah that's exactly what I said. It irreversibly changed the protocol without a fork, by changing the code of the reference client. That is why I said that the core developers have absolute co trol over the protocol. They can make changes without allowing miners the opportunity to follow the other fork, because they cleverly write their code in such a way that there is no other fork to follow, and then they market that with the term ""soft fork"" which sounds nicer even though it's more Machiavellian, and use the marketing term ""hard fork"" as a villian because it sounds dangerous. And gullivle people fall for this and believe that so called soft forks are somehow better when really they are subverting the process of the nakamoto consensus.

This is patently false. The whole *hard fork versus soft fork* distinction comes down to whether the changes are backwards compatible. Segwit is a soft fork, it doesn't require changes to consensus rules to implement. 

The Core reference client doesn't mean anything in regards to consensus rules.

Not sure where you're getting your info from but it's completely wrong. ""Soft fork"" is not a marketing term and soft forks *are* better because they don't break mining/node consensus, not sure how you can honestly claim otherwise.

>I mean yeah it's down from the all time high but... Bitcoin is down from its all time high vs $ too. ATH isn't the bar. The general trend is upwards and BCH is enabling new use cases, like memo.cash, Cointext, and being able to use it for small payments. Recently the price vs Bitcoin is rising, but that's not the metric most BCHers care about. They care about usage which I admit is low but I believe it's also rising.

I said the **ratio** is down from ATH, not the fiat pairing (which is also way down from ATH). The general trend is definitely **not** upwards. Again, you're claiming something that is just objectively untrue. Not only is market volume for BCH completely in the shitter (which is an embarrassment given that it benefited from 8 years of existing network distribution before genesis), it *also* is [processing less transactions than Segwit addresses on BTC](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-segwit-transaction-capacity-increase-update/). There's literally no way for you to spin this as BCH is suddenly becoming more useful, relevant or valuable. All metrics point towards the opposite conclusion. 

Please stop with this subversive astroturfing. The ""facts"" you're citing are not facts at all, they're falsehoods. If, ideologically, you support BCH for whatever reason, that's fine but to claim that the metrics are positive is just a complete falsehood. Again, volume, ratio, transactions, etc. all paint a very different picture than what you're claiming. This is what I don't get about BCash shills, these data are not hard to find and yet every shill seems to assume that nobody is going to fact check their claims.

It is not just the cake transaction that would be invalidated. It is all transactions in the same block as the cake transaction. If said block contains ANY other fraudulent transactions big or small, this cake transaction could be rejected. So technically it would make sense to make a customer wait around for at least 1 or more confirmations to eliminate risk. But, that's not really pragmatic, so accepting the risk of a block rejection is the risk you take when using Bitcoin in cases like these. A faster, cheaper fee crypto would eliminate such risk. ;2;1;False;Chowdahhhh;dy7xsms;I took a trip with some friends to a sleepy rural town in Japan, hours outside of Tokyo.

I'm not sure exactly how it works with these bitFlyer terminals, but the actual bitcoin transaction is wrapped up behind the scenes, so I don't think it would be possible to double spend.

To reverse that transaction once it's propogated the network would require an extraordinary amount of work for a couple of dollars and even if you managed to mine the next block with a replacement transaction going to a different address which invalidates the original transaction you would need to subvert the entire system just for one piece of cake.

"Currently the network is not congested so transactions are entering blocks at relatively low fees. 

For low priced transactions, most merchants are not concerned about waiting for confirmations because the cost of cheating the system (“double spending”) is greater than the value gained from the attack. A transaction without any confirmations is called a 0 confirmation or “0 conf” transaction. 

Waiting for a greater number of confirmations is recommended when the value of the transaction is higher. For example, 6 confirmations is safe enough for a transaction valued in the millions. This means waiting about an hour on average, assuming a competitive fee was included.";7;2;False;robamichael;dy81t8t;I took a trip with some friends to a sleepy rural town in Japan, hours outside of Tokyo.
