"I am saying that, much like Bitcoin through Coinbase, if Valve couldn't get dollars out of the other end of the process they wouldn't take Euro-denominated credit cards, and therefore nobody could rationally describe Valve taking those as a good thing for the Euro currency. Valve do not care about what currency they take because that is abstracted away from them; if they had to individually convert between Euros, pounds, Turkish lira, roubles, whatever into what they actually want (dollars) then that adds hassle to their process. The same applies to Bitcoin - taking pure Bitcoin is a mug's game, frankly, hence the existence of Coinbase, which does absolutely *nothing* for Bitcoin as a currency and in the final analysis just makes it an insanely expensive and computationally intensive way of moving dollars around, a problem that has already been solved quite adequately by any number of solutions and with numerous upsides over and above those minor ones offered by Bitcoin.

And the discussion has become one about whether using Coinbase to get USD is actually taking Bitcoin, my argument for which would be ""no, it isn't"".

"So you are saying that steam is accepting euro because their merchant acquirer is converting them to dollars.

Dunno why are you mentioning anything about bitcoin potential, the discussion is about newegg accepting bitcoin and people not acting on their promise to leave reddit when they start doing so.";0;1;False;pantaril;ciqh52p;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg
"Did my first TigerDirect buy with btc, 2nd time spending bitcoin besides buying a car last year! 

Anyway to give clients the option of coin base or bit pay?

Also maybe update the site and survey part to allow feedback for bitcoin sales?

Some of these merchants must consider supporting blockchain as they are the fastest and best, even above bitpay and coinbase. we learned this after trying to import our savings to test buy via tiger direct.com 

we started import on coinbase to wait wait wait and joe or joel with customer service told us there was an issue with importing which would be fixed asap. Blockchain and bitcoins were fast and easy...if only we didn't loose .50-1.00 via bitpay rates compared to blockchain or coinbase. either way fast and easy after we got past importing the paper wallet.. millibits would be smart too.

Also maybe offer FREE SHIPPING ON ALL BITCOIN SALES?

Tiger was cheaper for graphic cards and newegg was cheaper for keyboards;)";1;0;False;WeDoCoins;ciq5xch;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/
