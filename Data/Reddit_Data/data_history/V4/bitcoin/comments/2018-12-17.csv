Funny, your own post shows you had only a small savings to put a down payment on a house and it was from 9 months ago. Therefore, you didn't buy one yet. Second, assuming you are not lying, that you made a very large purchase solely from btc, you would have large capital gains tax...I hope you paid your taxes on the sale of any btc in the 1st quarter bc you will be hit with penalties and fees for underpaying your taxes.

"You live in a time with 10 times the material wealth as compared to any other. Give it up. The systems you describe were tried and are failed. Current system is failed as well and will be replaced by a better one , but most certainly not by some 19th century contraption FFS.

It is like saying my home vexes me because a lot of housework arises from it so let me burn it down instead.

BTW I have lived in places were so called ""globalist slavery"" takes places. Young people indeed work there, but the alternative was actual slavery on the fields, being literally owned by some a$$hole on top. Working on a factory it was an incredible upgrade, that families pushed for.

Things are not good, but far better (there) than 100 years ago. 

You are angry because you live in an imperfect world, but please , in the process of trying to make it less imperfect do not revert to an even less a perfect than the one we have today...

It is like rock climbing. All crevasses suck, however some suck less than others. Regional markets and autrarky cause immense differences in wealth between nations, which in part is what causes wars (imbalances of power between regions of the world,). What you call globalism finally (*finally*) brought some market efficiency and the strife for market equilibrium. It decreases the chances f war.

It is bad and it happens more slowly than it needs to be one hand, and more abrupt on another. But gods is it one million times better than anything tried before.... Goddamn autarky caused the world to be brought before the gates of WWI and communism before the gates of WW3 (that was happily avoided).

"**Fiat money**

Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity).

Bitcoin replaces all the middle part with awesome elegance.  The two shopkeepers only need to value the Bitcoin or have some way to exchange it locally. Bitcoin is the settlement mechanism for the two shopkeepers but that is invisible to you and your friend.  You used Bitcoin without knowing it.

There are more levels to bitcoin though.
