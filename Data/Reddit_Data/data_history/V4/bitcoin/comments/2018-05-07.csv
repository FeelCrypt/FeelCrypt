">You obviously have no training in market dynamics.

And, pray, why do I have to? You'd be better to skip the tiresome condescending and make your point. You sound like a bitter refugee from r investing who got into crypto too late.

As I said if they're not scared they're fucking stupid. Whether it's 4 billion 40 billion or 400 billion that's not in their hands.

I've been reading disparaging comments like yours on here for six years. If you don't think Bitcoin or some crypto will not transform finance you're sorrily mistaken.

">>You obviously have no training in market dynamics.

>And, pray, why do I have to?

Because you actually think there's 400$ billion in crypto, lololol, when you can quantitatively measure the actual dollar amount is less than five billion based on the last sell off, half of which is irredeemable tether. Paper market, with no liquidity backing it.

>You sound like a bitter refugee from r investing who got into crypto too late.

I actually sold all mine at 16k, and dont plan on buying at these prices. Might buy some more at 2k just for the lulz. Until then I'm happy making 200k+/annum in the futures markets.

>As I said if they're not scared they're fucking stupid. Whether it's 4 billion 40 billion or 400 billion that's not in their hands.

This is next level stupidity. That's not how banking works, kiddo.

I know what might help you to get art. Try making art. Imagine something creative that doesn't already exist and go try and create it. I offer this unsolicited advice because to go through life without being moved by art is akin to going through life without falling in love. Don't be cynical, just be open to the experience. I appreciate music for example much more when I either imagine myself playing one of the instruments, or that it is being played or sung right in front of me. For me visual art is different. I don't need to imagine myself painting it, but I marvel at the results of the artist. Some art seems to capture the spirit of the artist, and those are the best. I also love some of the work by Kandinski, because he makes you see things that aren't even there. ;4;0;False;elfof4sky;dyk7h8n;Thanks a lot for your bitcoin donations on my street art piece in Paris, already 130$ received 🙏🙏🙏;8hhezz;https://i.redd.it/xk3bpe8n9aw01.jpg

"Because you are making a stencil, you have to have bridges between negative spaces or else sections of it will fall away - unless you adhere your stencil material to the surface to be painted before cutting it. This is the reverse of that. You could cut it out on paper (or acrylic or whatever) but you would 1. Have to print or draw it, and 2
have to be very careful to make thin bridges at the corners of each square you cut out. This way is actually less time consuming. ";33;1;False;;dykbe9u;Thanks a lot for your bitcoin donations on my street art piece in Paris, already 130$ received 🙏🙏🙏;8hhezz;https://i.redd.it/xk3bpe8n9aw01.jpg

Nor is it any different to the myriad art pieces we've seen posted in here with a link to an online shop.

Should also point out that OP was saying thankyou for the donations so far.

If those donations help OP find a degree of financial freedom she/he wouldn't otherwise have attained, this means they might have more time to be able to create further good art like this, which is good for the entire space.  Organic creative works like this sure beats a billboard ad.
