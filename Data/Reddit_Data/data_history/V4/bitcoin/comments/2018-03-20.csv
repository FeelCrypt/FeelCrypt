"Yeah, no.  A better analogy would be: a bunch of McDonald's managers notice a variety of inefficiencies are starting to become problematic for their business. They notify corporate and request a policy change to eliminate those inefficiencies.  Corporate basically tells them to go fuck themselves.  So they rip up their franchise agreements, form their own company, and re-brand their restaurants.  They re-launch with the inefficiencies fixed, so they can provide better service and prices to their customers, while still offering essentially the same products.  They keep their locations and the basic decor with a similar brand feel, because they want to keep as much of the business that they've been building for years as they can. 

Noticing their success, McDonald's utilizes its superior financial resources to organize a smear campaign against the new competitors, rather than incorporating the ideas their competitors suggested and are now using to their advantage.  They make all kinds of unfounded accusations, organize boycotts of any businesses that support their competitors, and launch a big marketing push for a new product that they hope will bring back some of the old customers (even though most customers just want the basic items they've come to enjoy and expect).  

All of this could have been avoided if McDonald's corporate had just listened to the concerned managers and adopted their suggestions, but nooooooo...""changing corporate policy is too hard, it's just not worth the time and effort!""

"> you’re just another guy who dropped a few hundred on a trend hoping to get rich.

I can't speak for /u/norfbayboy, but for myself at least, no.  I'm a guy who doesn't really care all that much about the exchange rate of bitcoin to fiat and do in fact believe that bitcoin is *better money* that can bring real tangible benefits to our global society.

> otherwise it’ll just end up in the too hard basket and regulated/banned.

If some governments ban it, it'll definitely slow down adoption, sure.  Governments ban a lot of things that people continue to use though.  Any government that seriously tried to enforce a ban on bitcoin would quickly find themselves coming up against some serious ethical questions around basic freedoms though.  Bitcoin transactions can be encoded in basically anything (even smoke signals if you want to get low-tech), so to effectively ban it (rather than just in name only), they'd need to be tyrannical about all forms of communication.

I can't imagine any modern western country choosing to become an oppressive police state purely to enforce a ban on bitcoin.  This would mean that the actual outcome of any attempt would be similar to the ""ban"" on peer to peer sharing of movies and other copyright protected media content.  A joke.

> Don’t act like you don’t trust either... bitcoin is wholly built on trusting a few.

No, it *really* isn't.

> You’re trusting the whales won’t steal all of your money

They can't.  no matter what anyone else does, my bitcoin are mine and will remain so until I willingly choose to send them to someone else.  This is totally unlike traditional digital monetary systems (e.g. bank accounts), where a centralised controller (e.g. the bank) is able to do with my funds what they will.

> that exchanges aren’t pumping and wash trading for their own benefit

I'm not trusting in that at all.  In fact, I expect they are doing so since it makes sense for them financially.  I don't see how that should bother me though.  I can really only imagine it bothering people that are interested in bitcoin in order to ""buy low, sell high"" and increase their fiat holdings (which as mentioned, is not me).

> that miners give a shit beyond profit

The entire concept of mining is built to *expect* that miners don't give a shit beyond profit.  They are economically incentivised to follow the rules (that is, they make the most profit from doing so).

> that malicious actors (or even wallet producers) won’t just allieviate or lose all of your crypto forever

No one has access to my bitcoin but me.  I don't store significant amounts in systems that I am not able to personally verify the security of.  (I do store a small amount in a mobile based phone wallet for daily use, and it's entirely possible for the supplier of that wallet to do an update to the app that steals that money since I don't tend to verify mobile app updates; however as its only a very small amount, I have chosen to accept a trade-off of trust for convenience in this specific case.  It was however a conscious choice and not a requirement - I could write my own mobile wallet or just not use mobile wallets if I wished).";2;1;False;dalebewan;dvzhcyq;Today, I will defend Bitcoin in front of the Finance committee at the Canadian parliament (live);85j822;https://twitter.com/jhamel/status/975712250962087936

"I encourage you to take a step back, and analyze the situation for yourself.  Things are not always as they appear.

The disinformation campaign against Bitcoin Cash has been carefully orchestrated.   For instance, why do you think the core devs keep calling it a ""scam""?  So that when people google it, they will be bombarded with links referring to it as such.  Scams are common in this space (e.g. 99% of ICOs), and thus, the word ""scam"" triggers an emotional response from many people.  With that in mind, why do you think the core devs call Bitcoin Cash ""bcash""?  Well, they want to avoid using ""Bitcoin"" and ""scam"" in the same sentence, as that could negatively influence search results for ""Bitcoin"".  

The core devs do not wish to compete with Bitcoin Cash -- they only wish to slander it.  But competition is healthy for Bitcoin, and should be encouraged.

"If that's your case, then why stop there? Why not go even further back through the commits and grab the code that is closest to Satoshi's last commit?

Consensus exists for a reason. And it keeps things more decentralized. 

Ultimately, anyone has the right to create a hardfork. But declaring it as ""The true bitcoin"" on the basis of, ""because Satoshi said so"" goes against the whole point of a decentralized, consensus-driven, open-source project in the first place. 

Why Bitcoin-cash rather than any of the other hardforks? Remember that Bitcoin Unlimited was a thing? With the same backers. That didn't go very well. So the process repeated.

Look, I don't want to argue this point after this comment because it is tiring. I understand the reasoning why people want to go to bitcoin-cash. I really do. But I fear that it is going to fall really far behind. 

Larger block sizes are fine as long as the adoption rate stays slow and the hardware improves faster than the network grows. But it completely ignores the poorer parts of the world. It makes transactions harder, mining harder and broadcasting the blockchain less reliable for those with less bandwidth. 

Not to mention, what happens if the blocks fill up and people vote for the blocks to not get bigger? Do you just hardfork again?

Let's imagine that doesn't become an issue... The first world will probably be fine with an increase in block size, but it doesn't increase the efficiency and it makes the barrier to entry harder (in terms of higher cost hardware to run nodes). The third world is so far behind us in regard to accessing our technology and they are the ones that need bitcoin more than any of us do. Forget about the price for a while, and let's get back to men with guns stealing your money. We here, on Reddit, are pretty safe. But most of the world isn't. They need this more than we do, so it is imperative that we keep the barrier of entry as low as possible. Making Bitcoin more efficient and multi-use allows for it to become a store of value, like gold. A blockchain that can be used for proof of ownership when it comes to land, medical records, etc etc. A way to trade and have commerce instantaneously and have the barrier of entry so low that we can bank the unbanked. Bitcoin isn't there yet, but it will be. The more efficiently it can do all of these things, the more people that can and will use it. 

Larger blocks increase not only the blockchain but the mempool also. Increasing the cost of bandwidth, storage and ram.

This all creates a higher likelihood that fewer people will run nodes and therefore mean that fewer people will signal what they want for the future of Bitcoin. These are all bad things.  

Blocks being full and fees being higher is a small price to pay in the short term for letting bitcoin become more efficient, more liquid, more decentralized, keep the barrier of entry low and allow more technology to be built on top of it. That will increase the network effect and increase the usefulness of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Sidechains and second layer solutions help increase bitcoins effectiveness without compromising the barrier of entry (except for the temporary cost issue). Then if we hit a point where those other layers still don't keep the block size down, we can still increase the block size later. 

Anyway, you have the freedom to choose whichever blockchain you want. I've ranted about this for far too long and I admit that there is a possibility that I could very wrong about all of this. Maybe the adoption rate won't sky-rocket in the way I expect it to. And the block size increases wont matter.

Is there fundamental differences in the technologies/protocols which distinguish the former as legitimate and the latter a scam?

If you can't and you are basing this on nothing but your own opinion based on assumptions regarding the motivations of the actors influencing Bcash, you should have set those opinions aside.

Edit: Having just finished watching the entire hearing, I commend you on your answers to the questions asked, you did an excellent job addressing these issues as well as underlining how Bitcoin reinforces the proposed blockchain use cases.

I will also buy huge amounts of McDonaldss stock to inflate the price and use that as a way to convince people that our value will go up. I will also start spending money to send people (this is a reference to TX's) to start going into McDonalds to buy the smallest value item as possible and subsequently slow down their service.

"The Bitcoin fork happened because Roger Ver capitalized on Bitcoins growing pains last year. The popularity of BTC last year grew exponentially and the network wasn't prepared to handle it, but the solution (Segwit, LN) wasn't there just yet.

"Thanks for your time in doing this.

Just some feedback:

For the guy who queried about being able to physically touch bitcoins my preferred example is transacting using EFTPOS, explaining that money is already digital and going to shop and using a credit card just involves a bank reducing your digital balance and increasing the shop's digital balance. At no stage does a paper bill change hands. The updating of the bank's ledger represents the value exchange, and then go into your example of bitcoin having a public ledger.

The committee doesn't phrase their questions well. When they say, ""does bitcoin get used to launder money"" what they actually mean to ask is, ""is bitcoin better at laundering money than cash"". 

In response to that continue to example of bitcoin being a public although pseudonymous ledger which when converted back to fiat currency captures ""identity"" under current AML/KYC laws.

Also, because Bitcoin's ledger has a full history it is unlike
 cash where you can only track the last entity that handled it. You don't know who touched the cash before the current person who gives it to you. Therefore Bitcoin is not as fungible as cash.

Finally, the existing laws in place allow supoenas and warrants to be issued that allow authorities to trace transactions once identity has been captured by an exchange. That is sufficient to say confiscate laptops/computers which would assist in putting the identity/address trail back together.

For the person who queried on Bitcoin's intrinsic value, I agree with the comparison to gold being a bubble but he didn't seem very interested going down that route. Rather, Bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from being both a currency and a payment network. At the moment we need to rely on 3rd party payment solutions in order to transact with entities other than face to face. A dollar bill doesn't enable that but Bitcoin does as a payment network.

"That’s cool. Your provinces are similar to our states, right? In that they have their own sovereignty to legislate how they see fit, as long as they’re in the confines of the countries federal laws?

Just trying to piece together similarities so I understand. 

One thing you may or may not appreciate: under obama, he put out a thing called “the cole memo”. Essentially it was a proclamation saying that the federal govt wasn’t going to prosecute cannabis laws in states that voters chose to legalize; whether that’s medical or recreational (that last part im not 100% certain, or whether it was _just_ for medicinal. 

Anyway... our new attorney general (guy in charge of enforcing our drug, criminal and other kinds of laws) is a hard nosed opponent of any cannabis legality... and overturned or chose not to honor that cole memo. 

He made a recommendation recently that said that state attorney generals could prosecute at the federal level, at their own discretion. This to me, is ironic because the Republican Party (of which he’s a member) has this stance of “states rights”, being that they as a party value the states’ decisions in regards to their own laws and prosecution of said laws.

Anyway, long story short: the states that have chosen to a) decriminalize or b) legalize to some capacity consumption of cannabis have, for the most part, decided to not prosecute anyone that’s acting within the laws of the state they’re a citizen of. 

Which I find awesome.  

America has a history of enacting laws that are designed to continue an underlying bias towards prosecuting certain people groups, whether by race or class. 

It hasn’t stopped Trump from saying just today, that he thinks that they (the federal govt) should promote the death penalty for “drug dealers”. 

Meanwhile, we have a “opioid epidemic” that was propped up and propagated by pharmaceutical companies (Purdue pharmaceuticals, the makers of OxyContin) who regularly gives gobs of money to govt officials campaigns. Lololol

America’s govt is fucking moronic and transparently hypocritical and _fucked_. 

P.S. our federal attorney general is Jeff Sessions, is a known racist, judging on his legislation record... and he also is like 4 feet tall (an exaggeration) and looks like a weasel muppet / troll hybrid with beady eyes and a mouth that looks like an asshole. Which is fitting, because the only thing I ever hear come out of his mouth looks and smells like human shit.

"Haha nbd. I consume a lot of American media as do many Canadians (we don't have enough of our own) so i am VERY aware of Jeff Sessions and the hilarity of the states rights vs. Federal law situation you've got going on when it comes to your cannabis laws.

Provinces are very similar to states. Right now we have a very large disagreement between the province of Alberta and British Columbia. Alberta relies heavily on oil exports for its economy and wants to run a new pipeline through BC to reach the coastline. BC is very hipster/environmental and is opposed.

So Alberta has jacked up BCs gas prices to get us to give in. Causing Vancouver (my homeL to have the highest gas cost in all of North America at the moment.

Random I know, but just so you see our provinces are very similar to states. They have their own regional ideals and desires.

Hopefully we get our weed soon so we can forget about how much gas costs ;)
