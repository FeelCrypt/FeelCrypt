I mean think about it logically here for a second. This might have pushed up speculative sales but this new ATH isn't from actual new buyers. Consider what you have to do to buy BTC you have to go to an exchange put in a bunch of information, get verified, then buy, it is a process that takes a couple of days at least. So if this gets more people into BTC which I think it will, then we haven't even seen that.;2;0;False;megatom0;dmdoc2a;Bitcoin made it to John Cena's Instagram!;6x6dgh;https://i.redd.it/fz7kdhvsa2jz.jpg

Any one who saw this and didn't own BTC before likely hasn't bought yet because of this, simply because of the steps required to buy BTC from fiat. It takes a couple of days to get registered and whatnot. Sure you could buy from something like Liberty X but then you still need to learn the basics of BTC like getting a wallet and all that. I doubt that happened on a massive scale in just 3hrs (not to mention how difficult it can be to track down a liberty x or btc ATM). So if this does indeed bring in new people we have yet to see it. So buy safe every one.;5;0;False;megatom0;dmdonum;Bitcoin made it to John Cena's Instagram!;6x6dgh;https://i.redd.it/fz7kdhvsa2jz.jpg
