Seriously?  None of these expenses have anything to do with holding my dormant account?  Ridiculous.  You obviously don't know how banking actually works.

"> It is still consistent

Sure it's consistent, I didn't question his consistency. He's been an antiquated ruinous old fool for literally *decades* at this point. Very consistent. Unfortunately, I don't regard 'never changing your mind, ever, on anything' to be a virtuous trait.

> It is okay for the states to have more power as they would compete against each other on having the best policy. 

Utter, utter bullshit of the worst conceivable kind. You think it's OK for a state to make it illegal for you to have penetrative sex with your partner, and that's *ok* because all the gays can just move to another state? Fuck off. Some people *can't* just up and move whenever they want. 

> It is okay to have schools decide more of the curriculum so that we may discover new and more prominent ways of teaching

Don't be so naive. This isn't about finding new ways of teaching, it's about rich religious assholes using their money/influence to require schools to force disproven anti-science bullshit on impressionable young minds. It's disgusting, and you should be ashamed of yourself for supporting it. And before you say 'oh, people can just change schools' - no, once again, not everybody can do that. 

> It is okay to let businesses discriminate so as to ensure they will be challenged by their communities. Potentially making them change their minds, worst case scenario bankruptcy

No, the worst case scenario is that racist cunt business owners in racist cunt communities will become more and more successful because the racist cunt communities reward them with more business, thus driving more tolerant businesses into the ground and leaving minority races without access to basic goods and services. It is the literal definition of tyranny of the majority, and assholes like you will just sit there and say ""well, can't they just move to New York or something?""

> He is not senile old man. He is very open minded  

Ron Paul is one of the most *close*-minded people it's ever been my misfortune to research.

> and actually believe in humans to sort themselves out. A true progressive if you will.

And wherever humans *don't* 'sort themselves out', he's quite happy to cast the victims to the trash heap by removing any kind of legislation or social safety net that might save them. Luckily for society, he's never had even a sniff of real actual power, and never will.

> He also as you pointed out support a market of ideas and competition in politics between states

Unfortunately, many problems - often important ones - cannot be solved by a market of ideas and competition.

"> the immoral practices of price-gouging

In regards to this issue, I'd argue that price-gouging is actually good and helpful to society. If you understand basic economics then you know that price is a signaling mechanism for the supply and demand of a good or service. By allowing price gouging, which is simply just raising prices higher than what people might consider normal, you signal and incentivize more supply to come on board where it is needed until it comes back under a ""normal"" equilibrium.

"They're correct. 

""Money is energy"" is basically meaningless because there are different methodologies to produce the same amount of energy over different periods of time. And so, they are VALUED differently because they require different amounts of maintenance and infrastructure. 

In other words, you can generate some amount of energy by pedaling a stationary bicycle, but that will only generate at some small rate, and gobble up resources to be able to do it at some expense (food).

Versus, you have a trivial costing supply of power and can generate the same amount of energy cheaper and faster with, perhaps, a slightly different up front cost.

Energy here is the constant. According to you money = that energy, when clearly that is a variable.


In the real world the bicycle energy is VALUATED by all costs that go into creating that energy, as an inefficient waste of resources. Solution 2 is better and that becomes the value of energy. The same energy has two different values, but we ignore the inefficient one for the overall valuation.


I think the discussion is taking the euphemism ""money is power"" a bit literally, where the term is really more about influence and opportunity and not a literal power = energy output ...

For the issues I mentioned above:

Nothing wrong with this rule under libertarianism. Ron Paul was fine with it.

> Gay Marriage as a States’ issue

This is the libertarian belief and Ron Paul’s personal stance. The federal government shouldn’t regulate marriage and should only make a definition for the kinds of unions between individuals, leaving the enforcement of and regulation up to the States. This allows for some states to say they won’t grant any new unions between, for instance, 2 men.

> Gun Regulation

Libertarians don’t believe the federal government has a right to take away firearms, for instance. I, personally, prefer that convicted felons (especially violent ones) do not have guns.

I think we could probably both agree that the most fundamental services governments provide are a system of law and law enforcement. I really like David Friedman's thoughts on how a polycentric legal system could work. That's a legal system with no central authority defining or enforcing the laws. I believe this would be a much more adaptive and fair legal system than anything a government has ever provided.

"I think it’s important to note the intended function of a specific government institution. For instance, China’s social credit system is intended to marginalize dissidents and certain ethnic groups (creating an us vs. then situation instead of a people vs. government) and Saudi Arabia’s government monopoly on oil is meant to fill the government coffers which are directly tied to the royalty’s wealth. Considering those functions, these institutions are very successful (and very immoral).

USPS doesn’t have a monopoly, as seen by its major competitors FedEx and UPS. Those competitors are more than welcome to compete with the prices that USPS offer for small packages/letters, but they do not. USPS is meant to have the function to provide everyone the ability to mail letters to one another, a function it carries out quite effectively. I have no real comment on the Amazon situation because I agree that government subsidies to companies should be drastically cut down in general.

Some good examples of monopolies that are successful are the US Park Service (maintains the upkeep of national parks), government-monopoly healthcare systems like Sweden, and China Telecom/China Unicom/China Mobile which control the choice of Chinese citizens when it comes to their utilities (providing s constant a consistent price choice).";1;0;False;treesfallingforest;e8qo0gj;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/
"> Allowing price gouging is the fastest way to return market equilibrium to a disaster area.

Right here encapsulates the issue I am trying to highlight. The libertarian concern is to make a return to the status quo as opposed to ensuring the health and safety of those affected by a disaster.

In a situation where roads have been destroyed, it doesn’t matter how high the demand is because new goods are not going to be brought in so easily (unless by helicopter which would destroy the profitability, regardless of price gouging). That’s why an institution, like FEMA, that doesn’t have a vested interest in making profit is he best at getting life-saving commodities into a disaster zone because their incentive is saving lives and speed, so the extra cost on expensive transportation does not matter.

Unfortunately, he current administration has been cutting FEMA drastically despite the large number of natural disasters in recent years, moving some of that money over to the far more important ICE.";0;2;False;treesfallingforest;e8ql1q9;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"> Nope. Price trend is opposite.

It doesnt matter what the price trend is. If the dollar was going down instead then you might be able to claim capital losses instead. But since it is clearly rising, you owe for the gains.


~~~

Lets assume you bought your dollars at the beginning of the year. Your dollars are now worth 170% more BTC than at the beginning of the year

So each time you spend dollars, you have to report of gain of BTC.

And you owe taxes on the 10K satoshi per dollar gain. Buy a $1 soda at a vending machine; you have to keep the receipt, make an entry in your logs for the dollar-sale, and pay capital gains taxes on the 10K satoshi you gained. Since we are talking short term cap gains, that could be as high as 3.7 K satoshi.

If you make a 5000 dollar down payment on a car, and you owe the US government taxes for the 0.5 BTC gains, up to 0.185 BTC.

The dollar is practically unusable because of its reporting requirements and insane taxes.

"There are hundreds of examples in history across the world... I am not sure why you would disagree with that.

Most militaries are government monopolies. Land rights are generally government controlled monopolies (i.e. other organizations do not have rights to circumvent governments laws and regulations). Oil in many countries like Russia or Saudi Arabia are government controlled monopolies. In China the Social Credit System is a monopoly (not good for the people, but very effective at what it does). And then there are lots more examples.

Government monopolies aren’t even necessary, to clarify my argument. Government institutions provide affordable alternatives and competition to private industry.

"Thanks for you reply! I watched the whole video.

I disagree with a lot of the fundamental points that it made as well as his choice of scenario.

In his scenario, he was looking at a relatively weak disaster (a hurricane knocked out power) and a relatively highly priced item that is in short supply (a $800 generator). If we switch up the scenario to something like a category 5 hurricane that caused massive flooding, destruction of structures, and the destruction of roads and the goods being price gouged to bottles of water. Now it’s a real crisis situation where the commodity is something needed for life. It’s not so simple to say that the people who cannot afford (or perhaps had all their wealth destroyed) the commodity anymore can make do in the meantime. Perhaps someone is sick or in poor health and needs more water, perhaps a mother needs it for baby formula, perhaps a large but poor family needs it just to survive.

Moreso, in the scenario in the video, the only item being price gouged was a generator. In reality it would be everything needed: water, blankets, clothes, food, etc.. Price gouging forces poor people to choose which necessities they can give up to suffer the least (or have the highest chance of surviving). The idea that the increased demand from price gouging will help the poor more than restricting or preventing gouging is ridiculous as well because there is already a profit on those items (let’s say the $800 generator only cost $400 to make), so the incentive is already there to bring in more commodities.

The video also created a false dichotomy that the only two choices were price gouging and not. There is absolutely room to argue for better government support agencies to react to crisis situations. (As an aside, I know libertarians hate taxes, but I’m sure most pay for insurance and government organizations that respond in this situations are essentially insurance agencies, returning much of the value of the taxes those people pay.) Private entities also have the right to refuse a sale or purchase at any time (even in a crisis) especially if they are concerned about their supply. In addition those institutions can put a limit on the amount that any individual can purchase, doing a much better job than price gouging to stretch out the supply to as many people as possible.";1;1;False;treesfallingforest;e8qgtt6;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"Thank you for your response. I much prefer a discussion like this!

> Ron Paul pro-life as a States’ issue

This is another issue with libertarianism that I didn’t mention. There are huge issues with abortion being up to State decision. For instance, a situation where a state has written into law that abortion is murder would prosecute individuals who travel to other States where it is legal. There’s also issues with States that have it legalized are paying for those States that do not. This is all ignoring the issue that States are restricting personal liberty on religious grounds, which *should* be opposite libertarian beliefs.

> Convicted felons and firearms

It is easy to use the “protect their families” line while ignoring the realities of gun regulations and the violent actions of certain crimes. Should someone who is convicted of domestic abuse and assault with a deadly weapon (e.g. threatening to shoot an SO) ever be allowed to have a gun again? Should a serial killer like the recent Synagogue Shooter be allowed to have a gun 20 years from now? Should a convicted rapist who raped others at gunpoint ever be allowed to even touch a firearm again? These are all situations where a firearm in the hands of these individuals poses a direct and real threat to the life and liberty of innocent people. Since when does the right to a firearm outweigh anyone else’s right to life and liberty?

Could the government make it so that only violent felons cannot have guns? Sure. That isn’t the libertarian stance though, as the ideology says that government cannot regulate personal liberties (except when it comes to abortion and birth control I guess). I personally would be all for non-violent drug offenses not carrying the firearm restrictions.

> Court system

I disagree that following the logic would lead to libertarianism, but more importantly I need to clarify that I do not think the US court system is corrupt (I cannot speak on other systems). I would say my view is a pragmatist view that the court system is heavily favored towards those with money. Participation in the legal system requires money and the people most adversely affected by the law and legal systems are those without the money to participate. In addition, the court system is bogged down and slow while also being very complicated, preventing individuals from adequately navigating it without help.

This all makes it easy for corporation to abuse the faults of the legal system to circumvent existing laws and regulations. To further remove laws and regulations so that it would become the responsibilities of *private citizens* who have significantly less money and power than the federal government would be to push circumstances very far into corporations’ favor. In addition, moving regulation out of the hands of the government and into the legal system would further slow down an already tediously slow process.

> Government as a huge polluter

I disagree with this stance. I think this is a mischaracterization that libertarians like to use which sounds good for them but isn’t honest. Government is largely bureaucracy that gives out subsidies and regulates. Just because the government has a deal with, for instance, soy farmers doesn’t means the federal government is responsible for all of the pollution those soy farmers create.

> Knowledge about libertarianism

I agree that a lot of people don’t know a lot about libertarianism, but I think I disagree that that is a bad thing. I don’t think libertarianism would solve most, if any, of the major issues facing the country today. I think it’s more important for people to educate themselves on specific issues and form an accurate and informed opinion themselves rather than prescribing to an ideology that will tell them how to think.

It also annoys me that there are conservatives who hide behind a libertarian label to try to feign legitimacy for their arguments. You probably saw my disdain above when it comes to abortion because I know that under pure libertarianism neither States nor federal government would be allowed to restrict it, but other interests have hijacked that discussion and belief.";3;0;False;treesfallingforest;e8qk0ja;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

">You hire protection services for your private property.


That's an expense I don't currently have to monitor very closely and is socialized across the community to provide a common standard of security. 


If I am late on my bills or default on my security payments who extracts payment from me? How can I assure my safety or at least Justice after the fact during a period when I am unable to afford it?

>An inordinate amount of violent crime is caused by the government’s war on drugs.

Well sure, but that is more an argument to end the war on drugs than to end the government.  I do understand that with no government the war on drugs never would have begun in the first place nor any similar law, but I'm skeptical that the pros outweigh the cons here for reasons I'll get into in a bit.


>Remove the government’s monopoly control on protection services and firms driven by profit optimization will look for ways to provide the limited required services for their fees.


In modern markets these firms generally reduce costs by either combining services with other companies through acquisitions (like Amazon Alphabet etc) or by engaging in anti competitive ways to monopolize the market (like ATT TWC and Comcast).

With the former things look good but with the latter things look very bad. A combination of these two would basically be government.  Essentially I have a hard time seeing this work out such that the following *doesn't* how over time: 

 * private security firms spring up in communities everywhere don't the best they can for citizens

 * These firms coalesce in order to better service large municipalities

 * The mergers continue and some incorporate additional services that have nothing to do with security but are things people want nonetheless (ie debt collection, legal-like services, fire protection, possibly even turnpike passes, the list goes on)

 * Conglomerates end up servicing large parts of the nation as ""private security"" but their combined subscription looks less like car insurance and more like Amazon prime / Costco memberships with additional costs but also additional services


At this point we would likely have a couple of massive firms providing ""security"" to most of the country with little alternatives in the areas they service (similar to ISPs).  Is there anything preventing anticompetitve behavior at this point? Anticompetitve can be anything from undercutting local services to outright attacking and burning down competitive entities. 


At the end of the day you'd almost have to pay these people for security, a monthly, or yearly fee, a ""tax"" as it were in order to stay safe. 


I understand, this is a completely concocted scenario, but the point still stands. In a nation with no government, what's to stop a similarly large and powerful entity from acting exactly like, if not outright becoming, a government?

These companies would exist primarily for profit, as there would be little reason to run a non profit if there are no taxes to begin with. The primary driving factor for these institutions is the generation of wealth for the company, anything /everything else is incidental. 


The government today exists in large part because individuals, groups of people, and companies have demanded that the little institution this nation started with as additional services to it's mission statement. In effect the market asked for this.

"*Decent* isn’t the right word at all. Ron Paul cares more about libertarianism and it’s purity than the well-being of people. Being an idealist doesn’t mean he’s a good person, even if you agree with a lot of his votes.

Libertarianism has a terrible track record on issues. Ignoring how the ideology completely falls apart when it comes to large-scale economic structures, it falls on the wrong side of many social and environmental issues and Ron Paul’s record shows that. A country where Don’t Ask Don’t Tell is acceptable, gay marriage is a state issue, gun regulation is non-existent, the Clean Water Act is a violation of “people’s rights,” and likewise with the Clean Air Act is absolutely horrifying. Plus there is much more.

"One must first understand the relationship between government and taxation.  A story that goes in short like this.  

The masses are asked to pay taxes, or charged as per government law, rules or regulation.  The sums are accumulated in a Consolidated revenue fund.  In turn these fund are spent by government for the benefit of not one but the society.  A city tax might build a new arena, a bridge, or community transport system, then pay to maintain these systems. 

 At the federal level this would be the same, with the exception that every fiscal year the left over amount in this fund is divided into the states or provinces.  Federal Government not only pays National parks, pensions, etc., it also pays remittances.  I don't know about the USA, but in Canada, that is nothing less than every bill we get that has a '96' written in the bottom right corner.  

This is a paid for bill by federal gov. from the workings of our forefathers on our land, but you can reinvest in the company if you like, hence pay the bill.  however we have all been incited to see the remittance as an obligation to pay, and so we all pay them.

If there is no taxation on Bitcoin and it becomes mainstream currency, then there is no more need for Government and all its laws, rules and regulations.  Kiss your government pensions good bye!  Lawlessness at a global level because BTC is a global currency.  So when a government agent pushes for tax free btc, he or she is pushing themselves out of a job.

"While we're at it, get rid of income tax altogether, and move everything to property tax.

It's going to happen eventually anyway. Once crypto becomes the norm, the government will have no way to enforce income tax. Property tax also aligns with what government actually provides: a monopoly on force. If you want your property rights physically defended, pay the big guns in the form of property tax. Income tax is just needlessly invasive.

And there's even a neat idea to bypass ""assessment"" (whereby your property's market value is estimated to determine how much tax you owe): Don't assess, let each person self-report his own property's value. The wrinkle is, they actually have to put it for sale at that price. So if you have a $500,000 house, and you try to get out of property tax by listing it at $1, someone will just instantly buy it and you'll be out on the street. In fact, you have to value your house at what it's worth to YOU, not the market. If you know you could sell your house for $500k but it's not worth it for you to move your family, you'd have to list it at a big enough premium that you know no one will take it (or if they do, you make enough money to be fairly compensated. Say, $1m). The tax rate would take this premium into account, of course, since nearly every homeowner would be paying it. 

So if everything was property tax, the rate would have to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%. That would probably cause rent prices to roughly double, but everyone would have their entire income to spend on rent, instead of only ~75%, so overall it should be a wash.

"“In gambling the house always wins”

This is not true. If we each place bets on the outcome of a coin toss, there is no ‘house’ and the odds are evenly split between us, yet this is still ‘gambling’.

Even if we take a game like Texas Hold ‘Em, where there is an element of skill involved in the game, it is still ‘gambling’.

Finally when you take into consideration that the value of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by a few key traders, the extent to which you can say there is no ‘house’ is in doubt.

But what I was getting at was that in practice, people are using bitcoin as a form of gambling rather than as a form of currency. Yes there are a few places where bitcoin is used as a currency by enthusiasts, but ordinary people are not using it in this way, even those who are familiar with Bitcoin.

And I was not suggesting that the internet cannot be used for good, or that it is beneficial (I am of course using it at this very moment) but we should not ignore its problems.";0;0;False;PragueUprising;e8q9850;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"That’s sort of the point though. 

Capital gains tax should be levied on speculative investments. If you buy bitcoin with USD, hold it, and then convert it back to USD, Bitcoin is not being used as currency, it’s being used as a means of price speculation. 

If you are buying bitcoin with USD, and then using that bitcoin to purchase a car, then it’s being used as an intermediary currency. 

If we could rely on people to correctly report how they were using Bitcoin, this would be a problem that solves itself. However, since this is an obvious loophole that would be abused, and because as you stated there are very few situations where bitcoin is used as a currency, it makes sense to treat it as the speculative investment that it currently is.

"Yes and no. There's tricks to it.

Currencies are not exempted from taxes. The traditional ""capital gains"" are still taxed if you are trading currencies like an asset. There are exemptions/loopholes [notably IRC section 988(a) (1) (B)] that make certain types of currency trading more profitable than typical stocks and all the big players use these.

Additionally, some state and local taxes cannot be applied at all to certain trading. Same goes with interest accrued on federal treasury notes which is oftentimes what they will hedge against. Additionally, there are other exemptions for long-term arbitrage plays and other types of trades that are not traditional forex trading.

Lastly, I thought Forex trading was actually mostly exempt in the UK? It's one of the reasons why London is one of the financial capitals of the world.

I am not an accountant or lawyer. I may have gotten some of this wrong. This is not professional advice, just info.

"I've bought things online in foreign currencies plenty of times, but I fail to see how this applies at all.

I never held any GBP, and the USD I spent was converted to GBP by the payment processor.  

The misconception I'm poorly trying to point out is that you don't have to pay capital gains tax just because you used Bitcoin. If you bought the Bitcoin and then immediately used it to buy something, there would be no gains realized because there would be no gains present.

Just using Bitcoin doesn't constitute capital gain, it's the fact that it's worth more than when you bought it.

The two sides of your argument aren't in parallel, unless you're saying that you already had the Euro because you exchanged USD for Euro previously and the Euro has since gone up in value against the dollar.

"it's inelastic compared to Fiat currencies and so cannot be used as a financial tool to stimulate growth in the economy. Money is merely a substitute to debt. The banknote is basically a debt you have towards the central bank. 

Given that you cannot create more Bitcoins, it will be hard to use it for loans. If you make 1BTC a year and need 0,95BTC to live that year, will you lend that meager saving to someone starting a business? Businesses need loans to pay wages and machinary they need to produce goods they have not yet sold. With the current system, you can create 10 dollars I think from a 1 dollar saving. Businesses can loan that money and pay their bills until they make money to pay back the loan. 

Bitcoin by design is very unfit to be a global or national currency because of those two points.

Money is much more complicated than its definition in a dictionary.

The financial system we have today is as a result of trial and error. It's not perfect but it's got its perks. i.e easy access to capital by businesses. Replacing Fiat with Bitcoin is not just replacing the payment method. It also involves replacing a whole eco-system. And those leading the crypto movement are geniuses in computer science but average in economics.
