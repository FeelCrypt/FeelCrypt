"The unique challenge with bitcoin is that its risky so its best to invest slowly and steadily and not pay attention but with crypto you HAVE to pay attention because there are so many currencies popping up and tech/software evolving etc. It just takes a LOT of discipline to avoid trying to play the market while watching the price fluctuate so much and so often.

My advice is to set up and automatic exchange of like $20 a week or whatever you would consider pretty much insignificant and to keep up just scan the headlines for bitcoin related news. If the price spike, sell half of what you have and go back to scanning headlines. Your saftey is the low constant investment. If you stick to the same, low, regular investment then you are at least protected from losing a lot of money (although you may miss out on gaining a lot, just accept that as a condequence of investing safely and smartly.";1;0;False;FormalAppearance;dxafdg7;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"Do you not find it strange that there's a financial disincentive to ""use crypto the way it was created to be used""?

You can't expect to just tell people to act against their own interest for the good of crypto, people don't work like that. That is not a sustainable model. 

This is what people wanted when they wanted a fixed supply ~~currency~~ store of value, something that would indefinitely increase in value and so would always be more profitable to hoard than to spend. 

There is something fundamentally wrong with the way it was created to be used if the way it was created to be used is less profitable than hoarding it.

The long term supply is fixed, being able to subdivide the units doesn't make it any less scarce.

"So we're both accurate from where we are speaking from.  I agree, if there's no need to exchange, sure.  If I knew that no matter what happened to bitcoin over the next month that my .000012 widget is still going to be that much I would be very comfortable using it.  But bitcoin is purely linked to fiat so it doesn't matter if I have the same amount of bitcoin.  Due to it's instability, no one can really price in it in the first place.  

Until that gets fixed I dont know what you can do.  + once it's popular youre just going to get hit with some kind of tax or exchange fee to get into bitcoin just like a normal currency trade.

"I dont think im missing the point.  I'm just looking at it very practically.
""
Right now, nothing is priced in bitcoin.  Anywhere. And if it is, it's directly linked to how it's doing against fiat.  For the sake of simplicity lets pretend that I have a widget I can buy for exactly 1 bitcoin based on the current price of bitcoin.  I sell it for 2 bitcoin to customers and people buy it all day long.

That widget might only cost me 1 bitcoin today, but tomorrow the value of bitcoin may go down, so it's going to cost me more than that 1 bitcoin since I'll need to add more bitcoin to cover the difference.

Meanwhile, if I were using dollars.  I wont have that issue at all.   Ever. Unless of course you think the currency is going to collapse and that's incredibly unlikely for the foreseeable future so I'm not going to delve into any arguments that rely on that.

If bitcoin were stable, then it wouldn't be gambling anymore.  You can't operate a company for long term success if youre gambling on it's income and profits.  (generally speaking)

My analogy regarding stocks was that they can and often do fluctuate wildly day to day alone.

"I feel like most of the people downvoting this comment thread don't really operate a significant business.  If I had been running any business during the end of the year and based my operations off bitcoin I would have lost my companies when the price crashed from 20k down.  I simply would not have had the money to survive. The price still hasn't recovered.  

Like this actually happened yet people are still arguing it would be fine for a business.

Im not some huge baller, but I do six figures in all 5 of my companies combined.  I'm telling you that it would have crushed all of them except my airbnb business but thats soley due to that being a service that doesnt' require me getting goods.  I would have worked for dirt cheap, but the business would have been fine.

Everything else I do is retail related.  I would have been stuck with inventory I was selling for 25% to 50% of what I paid for it and no way to make a profit on any of it not to mention anything I had in savings would have reduced value by over 50% due to the drop price.

I really don't understand this view, although I see it a lot. Why would the market care about direct fiat <> altcoin options? If the market rates a given alt at a given market cap, it's because that's the perceived value of that alt. It has nothing to do with whether you have to go through bitcoin to get it.

"There is no use for or benefit from decentralization for any of the smart contracts on those platforms. Despite hosting hundreds of ICOs, there isn't a single business or organization actually utilizing Ethereum smart contracts to manage significant business (beyond pilot projects).

The only use for decentralization is as an unseizable, uncensorable store of value, i.e. money. The rest is all garbage hype. ";-1;0;False;vakeraj;dxbl83m;Altcoins waiting to see what Bitcoin will do;8bz18j;https://imgur.com/TxODJgX

"I mean,  it's true.  I hate seeing my alts go down even though they are obtaining partnerships,  gaining adoption,  generally becoming more useful than btc. It sucks.  In my mind,  when btc recovers,  and my alts go back to their previous aths, I'm not really thanking btc for that.  I'm thankful that my fortune is changing,  but i also understand that as soon as we no longer need btc as an on ramp,  my alts will move dependant on their own merits.  Which is a much more lucrative case for me,  considering my alts are much more meritorious than dusty ol btc.


And let's be real,  at the VERY least,  btc use is 50% people moving cash into alts.  So as soon as we don't need you,  not only will your artificial value plummet,  but you won't have anyone here to upvote your reposted meme.

I do appreciate what btc started,  and I understand that we wouldn't be here without btc, but we have come to a point where btc is the thing that's holding us back,  no longer propelling us forward.
