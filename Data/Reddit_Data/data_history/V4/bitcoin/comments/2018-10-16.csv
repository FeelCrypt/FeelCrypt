"Bitcoin marketcap: $114,096,481,597

Total electricity usage worldwide:  23,322TWh (2013, likely went up since). 0.6% is about 140TWh = 140,000,000,000 KWh. At the very generous low low price of 4 dollar cents per KWh that's $5.600.000.000 in cost.

The inflation rate for Bitcoin is 3.86% which comes to about $4.400.000.000 based on the above market cap.

Is the article suggesting people are mining at a loss, based on electrical cost alone? (before renting space, buying mining equipment, salaries, etc). And that this despite this loss miners keep investing? (Since difficulty keeps going up) even while knowing that in 2020 rewards will be halved.

Or is it seriously suggesting miners are getting sub 4 cent rated for electricity usage? (as far as I know such rates are generally reserved for aluminum smelters and the like)

"The operative word though is can-

A publicly traded company can be held accountable in a number of ways that are not of any real concern to them or their bottom line.

Write millions or mortgages to Americans w credit on the level of an 18 year old with their first credit card- cause an economic crash to which the effect are felt around the world?

-  “Congratulations bank, you have the world by the balls. We have no choice but to bail you out... but don’t do it again- Because well just have to do it again. “

Can you tell me the criminal results of the housing  market crash?

Actively ignore the transfer of the hundreds of millions/billions of dollars around the globe that allows criminal organizations dealing drugs, terror, and/or sex trafficking.

- ”Hey, stop... pay this fine that is on par with a swear jar in terms of retribution for passively causing murder, overdose, and human slavery.”

- “Ugh, ok. Well try to get better at ignorance.”

Can you tell me who, from any bank has felt the wrath of the law from this?

Ignore a glaring hole in your security, which is then responsible for releasing the private information of just about every single American with a store credit card. THEN delay the disclosing of the breach to those millions of people who are now vulnerable so the execs can liquidate their stocks before the price comes crashing down.

- “Do better Equifax”

- “We will attempt to do better.”

Anybody that made millions from insider trading expected to even be removed from from the industry there?

When your publicly traded corporation has gotten so big that it’s failure would have devastating implications on people way across the world can you really be held accountable?

There are valid arguments against cryptocurrency and it’s world wide use, and banks do serve a purpose. But a technology is not half as vulnerable to corruption as a human CEO.

The criminal utilization of crypto does not serve an argument in favor of the bank b/c those people, if caught, are far more likely to be subject to legal ramifications. Conversely, A bank’s criminal facilitation of the same sort for all intents and purposes- is subject to a slap on the wrist.

So while they can be held accountable, how would you do it without inflicting that pain on the people to whom justice is supposedly being served?

I'm not arguing for them in any way, but doesn't anybody agree that we should all be actively looking for ways to reduce power consumption - maybe proof of stake, maybe another proof system, who knows - but to dismiss their point straight up is not winning the argument and will not convince others.;32;3;False;smadgerano;e7vrzrz;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png

That's a lot of 'could', 'expected', and '2025' in one sentence.
