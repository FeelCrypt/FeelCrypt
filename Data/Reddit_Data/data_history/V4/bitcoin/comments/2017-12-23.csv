"> I understand your point and that's definitely the case today, but all the hype has been based on the fact that in the future, bitcoin can stabilize at a higher number due to its limited amount. So if at some point in the future it becomes the most widespread cryptocurrency, the value will need to go up to spread it out among so many more people.

Even *if* the price stabilizes, and there's little reason to think it will because it is entirely unregulated, the other problems I listed still remain. And thsoe problems, fees and transaction times, only get worse as more people adopt it. 

> But regardless, that's not relevant. The fact that you are saying you don't know when the bubble will burst is my point. I personally think it will eventually come, but that doesn't mean there isn't room to profit. If the price keeps going up for all of 2018 and then people sell then, can you really criticize them? ""It's dangerous and you could have also lost your money instead."" Well... yeah... it's volatile and they are taking a risk, but I don't see the value in saying ""It's a stupid investment because it's a bubble."" It clearly has the potential to go up in value and sold at a higher value, so what's the problem?

Google ""greater fool theory."" If you're investing solely under the hope that the price will continue to irrationally inflate, well, you're not investing. You're gambling. Pretty inefficient gambling at that. I can wait, at the very least, weeks for my money double with bitcoin, or I can place one bet on a football game and double it in 2 hours. And at least with football one can use some knowledge of the teams to find a weakness in the line. Gambling with btc is just blindly hoping that people will continue to dump money into it. It's musical chairs. And with most bubbles, there are FAR more losers than winners. 

But yes, if you go in with the awareness that you're gambling and not investing, that IS better. That should mean A) you're consistently realizing profits by selling, and B) you only have a tiny fraction of your portfolio in it. I understand the temptation to hop on the money train, and I sort of considered throwing a little money at it, but I figured the amount of money I'd be willing to lose on bitcoin isn't even worth the time. The only way to make a significant amount of money is to toss an irresponsible amount on it. 

> It seems like a lot of people who spend time arguing against it are bitter that they missed out, and feel like they are being wronged for taking what feels like an intelligent approach in identifying it as a bubble, but then seeing other people make massive profits off their investment.

Lol, this is a classic line used by bitcoin people but it doesn't hold any water. Do you see the same arguments made against Amazon, Apple, Tesla, etc? If I bought Tesla stock at the beginning of 2013, I'd have nearly 10x that amount one year later. Same story is true for most of us, we don't own Tesla stock by and large. Do you see hoards of people shitting on Tesla? No, because the value is clearly there. I didn't get rich off Tesla, but I recognize its value. 

> I was never bitter towards other people because I gave them credit for identifying the potential and capitalizing, but I certainly did feel annoyed as I watched what I missed out on. So I know there are going to be people like me, but who are also bitter about the fact that they couldn't make 10x their money in such a short period of time.

Silly mindset to have. There are countless opportunities to get rich super rich off investments. Companies shoot up in valuation all the time. Like I said, look at Amazon. If you bought shares for $5 a piece in '98, you'd have 220x that amount now. But how many people is that true for in reality? Bezos and a handful of others totaling under 10? It's fucking hard to find the investment that's gonna blow up, and even harder to know if you're selling at the right time. The majority of people who poured a shit ton of money into a dot com stock in the late 90s? They went broke. And if you got lucky and picked Amazon, you probably sold well before it even hit $100, let alone $1100. Or maybe they sold when it was back down to under $10 in the early 2000's. You just don't know. 

The point is, you have to be incredibly lucky, and in most cases reckless, to get rich off a speculative investment. It's not much different then Vegas, where for every big winner there's a hundred degenerates who lost everything. 

> What happened is real. People invested money, eventually pulled that money out, and had way more than they did before. And the whole time they were doing that, I was saying ""Nah it's a bubble, and I don't think it will go any higher than this."" Assuming I'm right that it is a bubble, those people who made a ton of money don't give a shit. People can call bitcoin monopoly money all they want, but the fact is that money can be put in, grow, and then pulled out, even if it does come at a big risk that can come crashing down even harder than how wildly it went up.

Yeah and gambling is real too. People really do get rich from it. And I'm happy for those people. But I would never call gambling a wise investment. ";1;0;False;Smooth_On_Smooth;drn28w8;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

">Literally none of those are an advantage for an average consumer though. Especially when you consider transactions are free for the consumer using a credit card (in nearly all scenarios). Also most of those don’t exist yet, credit cards will advance as well so it’s not really fair to compare the future to the present. At the end of the day you can’t get something adopted by the public if it’s only useful to a select 10 people who want to write money applications with nano transactions.  Why would that convince the average person to switch for buying their Starbucks? 

Refer to the internet. I have a message forum I set up for about 20 friends. I'm sure a similar argument was made for making a website for such a small amount of people when news stations clearly do a better job.

As for free credit card use, gas stations give discounts when you pay with cash. Same logic would apply.

What would convince the average person to use crypto? How about a 5% discount and a rewards program that uses blockchain references for tracking orders?

>The advantages they get today with credit cards:
>-interest free loan for 30 days

Sure, that's really nice. Credit cards aren't cash though.

>- cash back in purchases 

Gas station gives me more than 4% discount for paying in cash, and most cards don't give that type of cash back bonus (aside from moments where they give it for a month or two to get me into the habit of using the card regularly)

>- 0 liability fraud protection 

Like when someone steals your credit card and spends it? I put a pin on my mycellium wallet and it protects that can of worms from every being opened. As for situations with chargebacks, you could build a multisig wallet where a third party can verify the situation. Thing is, we could do a lot more than leaving it in the hands of the same company controlling the financial exchange.

>- security of funds (you can lose your card and nothing happens)

I can lose my phone right now and nothing happens. I have my backup keys securely stored.

>- other benefits like warranties, travel, etc

Warranties are now attached to the blockchain. A company provides their receiving address, and signs a message with the terms of the warranty. Also, the tech is only 8 years old. These solutions will be developed. The other rewards are from the merchant fees attached to the card, and the selling of user data.

>- building your credit to help you get a loan in the future 

I can still take loans and build credit. Car loan, credit cards where I use crypto to pay the monthly bill, etc.

>- all of this is completely free and often comes with a signup bonus as well as software that makes it much easier to document your spending

Give it time. I'm confident these things will develop over time.

>How are you going to convince people to give all that up en masse?

How do businesses convince people to pay in cash? Find a healthy, mutually beneficial medium where you both win on your terms, as opposed to the credit card company strong arming the terms and conditions once they gain market dominance.

You're acting like the credit card industry could never lose influence in the world, ever. If that's the case, put your money where your mouth is and invest in them for long-term gains. It's a surefire win according to your assessment.

"For reference, I'm European and we don't do the whole ""war on drugs"" in my country.

And you're missing my point. Correct, decriminalization of drugs won't make more drugs available. Trafficking drugs now, today, and selling drugs, today, is in no way a victimless crime. It costs many innocent people their life's both directly and indirectly. 

A decriminalization will not make government spending necessarily larger or smaller, that's not so easy to define.

My point was, that dealing drugs is not victimless. People have died along the way, before the drugs hit the consumer, and many consumers are pushed into criminal activities to finance their use of substances, because prices are high due to the risk the sellers are taking.

"If you're unaware of the brutal history that fueled the expansion of gold and silver metals after the columbus voyage to ""the new world"" I would encourage you to do some investigation.

Certainly mining gold doesn't *require* classic notions slavery (even if the conditions people work in are hardly different), but there's plenty of motivation to deny gold miners any sort of rights to acquire gold with as much return as possible. It would behoove you to research mining conditions in africa and south america, or anywhere at any point in time when unions weren't or aren't a thing.

So correction: gold mining only requires slavery under highly exploitative systems such as capitalism that seek to ensure the highest return possible on all investments at the expense of others.

"youve got it backwards. currencies and stocks are people simply agreeing.  bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually provide *real* utility.

I agree bitcoin itself may seem ineffective at its purpose currently, but the foundation of its economy is its utilitarian and technological value.

Bitcoin was the first, and it has a stranglehold on the market, and perhaps it will have the best innovation and stay on top for quite a while.  There are many alt coins that serve bitcoins initial purpose better than bitcoin at this point.....

Anyhow the point is that cryptocurrency's value has a *real* foundation while fiats value, and even stocks(as they dont directly serve a purpose, merely represent an ethereal ownership of a company with which most people can do nothing) have less intrinsic value than any functioning crytpocurrency. in the future i imagine most finance will be hosted on any number of blockchains.

- other benefits like warranties, travel, etc
- building your credit to help you get a loan in the future

"I always see this argument on here about how “the internet will replace money” internet internet internet. That’s the point in trying to make with credit cards, the internet already has replaced money. That’s what credit cards are, leveraging technology to make money better. People on this reddit seem to think bitcoin is like investing in google in the 90s and they are seeing the effects of tech on finance before it happens. It has already happened!

What you are seeing here is a digital replacement for cash, but cash has already been replaced by credit. You’re replacing something nobody really uses anymore. 

As for your 4% back at gas stations, taking away for the moment that there are cards that do that, at the end of the day, because cards are run on tech, and block chain is just tech, there is no reason to believe that banks can’t make credit card transaction fees just as low as bitcoin fees. Hell, they could implement their own block chain and use that. Banks are still in the old phase of credit cards, everything is still in on premise servers for the most part. When that stuff all moves to the cloud there will be immense savings. 

And I think you missed the point on some of those advantages. 0% liability is more than being able to freeze your card. It means that that $200 purchase that was made so that you even realize that you need to freeze your card is now not your problem. Chase pays for it/calls the police over it/ etc. They do all the legwork. Same with the interest free loan, the warranty extension, etc. Those are all services that cost money that are being provided by an institution. If you want any of that with bitcoin you will need some institution to do it, and then voila, you’ve got a bank. 


Edit:

I’d also like to point out the scale differences. Right now you’re seeing like 300,000ish transactions per day on bitcoin and the system is in crisis. Fees are insanely high and times are long. Credit cards do over 1000 times that many transactions per day, fulfill in seconds, and cost a tiny amount relatively. And all of that is running on 20 year old mainframe technology.

While gold can't really be destroyed without a particle accellerator, a PC can be destroyed pretty easily. Data loss can happen even if you're trying to back it up.

">I always see this argument on here about how “the internet will replace money” internet internet internet. That’s the point in trying to make with credit cards, the internet already has replaced money. That’s what credit cards are, leveraging technology to make money better.

That's like saying your ISP free email account is the end-game of the internet. The true innovation happens when anyone can innovate on the edge and not seek permission from the big companies.

>What you are seeing here is a digital replacement for cash, but cash has already been replaced by credit. You’re replacing something nobody really uses anymore. 

Cash is used quite a bit. Being simple, anonymous and frictionless is valuable. You can't buy things from me via credit card without me accepting the Visa terms and agreements. Venmo will eventually switch to a transaction fee system.

>As for your 4% back at gas stations, taking away for the moment that there are cards that do that, at the end of the day, because cards are run on tech, and block chain is just tech, there is no reason to believe that banks can’t make credit card transaction fees just as low as bitcoin fees. Hell, they could implement their own block chain and use that. Banks are still in the old phase of credit cards, everything is still in on premise servers for the most part. When that stuff all moves to the cloud there will be immense savings. 

Show me a free card that gives 4% or more cash back every day and I'll sign up for that card today.

As for the blockchain, you wouldn't be able to tap into it without their permission. I want to be able to tap into a blockchain without permission, guidelines, developer fees, etc.

Credit cards cannot make fees as low as Bitcoin fees in a sufficiently optimized scenario because banks want profits. Bitcoin is a truly non-profit bank system that works globally.

>And I think you missed the point on some of those advantages. 0% liability is more than being able to freeze your card. It means that that $200 purchase that was made so that you even realize that you need to freeze your card is now not your problem. Chase pays for it/calls the police over it/ etc. They do all the legwork. Same with the interest free loan, the warranty extension, etc. Those are all services that cost money that are being provided by an institution. If you want any of that with bitcoin you will need some institution to do it, and then voila, you’ve got a bank. 

I don't need that if I'm the only authorized user to use my Bitcoin wallet. Credit card theft exists because you're literally using the password for the account in the open, for all to see. In Europe they use chip & pin, and a lot less fraud happens as a result. In the US, it is more profitable to avoid using the link because it means more profits for credit card companies, as forgetting your pin means you can't buy anything. The fraud prevention is just the cost of doing business.

"This is what bothers me so much. It's a big step back from the system we have which has had the advantage of lots of smart people working on it for decades to make it as efficient as possible

Processing a credit card transaction requires fractions of the computing power of processing one on the blockchain.

How many people on these forums use cash for 100% of their transactions? Do they take their paper check pay stub to the bank every week and get cash anf then put it under their mattress? 

Right now people can hold a watch up to a terminal and have the transaction processed in fractions of a second with no direct cost to the consumer while also having the security that if someone steals their bank account info or credit card they can get the transactions reversed.

"Who holds the numbers matters less than how the value of the numbers is secured.

Having the private keys for your own bitcoin won't matter if a mining group gets 51% hash power, or miners move on to another currency, or quantum computing breaks the encryption that bitcoin relies on. You don't hold what is valuable at any point, which is the network of miners and the security of the technology.

Something like Bitgold has multiple layers of value security, the first one being the value of gold which you can redeem and hold physically, the second being insurance for the gold in its vaults, and the third is the power of law to enforce the contract and regulate their behavior, which will last for as long as the government does.

As long as Bitgold is up and running you can redeem your numbers for actual gold, and since you're only using bitgold to pay/receive then you wouldn't have most of your savings in their system anymore than you would have most of your bitcoin on an exchange.

Closing a ""channel"" might take more time with gold, but the underlying value is much more secure and the fees are lower, and the payment system is faster and more reliable.

For the record I don't think any deflationary currency is a good idea, I think using gold as currency is a waste of gold, but if centralization of payment is the solution to bitcoins problems, I don't see why we need bitcoin.

"People speculate on short term shifts in the value of currency and the relative value between currencies.

If you need me to be specific, then what I meant was that no one speculates on the long term value of currency like people speculate on bitcoin, although you could probably infer that's what I meant from context.

No investment fund just buys a bunch of dollars and then sits on them waiting for them to go up, because they don't go up. They might diversify risk by holding some amount of wealth in a broad variety of currencies, and they might try to profit from the short term variations in the value of currency but none have the strategy of ""buy currency, wait a few years, sell currency"", because that's a strategy that is guaranteed to lose money. Even if dollars have gone up relative to euros during that time, they will both be worth less than they were at the start.

Your link is only talking about these two forms of speculation, either profiting from short term fluctuations or arbitrage between different currencies. Currency is not a long term investment nor should it be treated as such.

Day trading cryptos is completely different from just buying a bunch of bitcoin and hoping they indefinitely increase in value faster than the market.

People speculate on short term fluctuations on currency value, and on the relative difference between currencies.

It is not the same thing as thinking ""I think dollars are going to be worth more in 5 years time so I'm going to buy a bunch of dollars now"". No one thinks that.

No one profits or attempts to profit from just buying up a bunch of currency, sitting on it for a few years and then selling it because its guaranteed to be worth less than when you bought it.

you bring up stocks and shares which is something completely different. Buying shares entitles you to a portion of the business. Some people speculate on the future value of businesses because some businesses increase in value over time. There can be short term scams like Theranos, but in the long run speculation is unsustainable if its not backed by underlying value of the company.

> The Great Depression from happening again

The great depression involved a crippling deflationary spiral which caused a huge drop in economic productivity by encouraging currency hoarding at the expense of spending money on producing and purchasing goods and services.

"Had a conversation with my wife’s grandfather yesterday. 

He’s a major doubter of Cryptocurrencies. Which I cannot get across to him the idea that there are more things beside bitcoin. Doesn’t matter the statistics I bring in front of him, to him it’s the equivalent of going down to the Casino and dropping $1000 on the roulette table. 

He told me yesterday, “Bitcoin lost 30% this week, I don’t know how anyone can see that as anything other than a gamble.” 

Yeah, sure, if you bought a week ago you lost 30%. If you bought a month ago you made 91%. If you bought a year ago you made 1600%. And, I’m barely even in fucking bitcoin. I didn’t lose 30% this week. Despite the entire market crashing I wasn’t even down, I was up 3% yesterday. And today I’m sitting pretty. 

His major argument is, “My Merrill Lynch financial advisor strongly advises against Bitcoin, and he has never steered me wrong in the past”. 

Dude, OF COURSE HE DOESNT WANT YOU IN BITCOIN. If your money is in Bitcoin, how does he make commissions on that money? 

I really don’t know how to make him see that it’s at least a semi-reasonable investment.

"Regarding the topic by OP, **I am running for Office** : For Knox County Mayor against [Glenn Jacobs](https://jacobsformayor.com/) aka [Kane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jiVzY3E1k)!!!! the Wrestler.

Glenn Jacobs is actually a good guy, and I am not running a 'hate' campaign against him. I am running a 'rehaul the system' campaign.

My Election is not until August, and I need 40,000 Votes to win. This will be difficult to achieve, as through name recognition, etc, I can probably get 1,000 to 2,000, but little more. However, I have thought it through.

Some major points of my campaign :

1) Localize Governance and Enforcement of Law.

> Move from an Election of a Mayor to an Election of Neighborhood Delegates. Neighborhoods are to gather together biweekly over a Saturday at a Park and discuss political objectives, vote on them, and the Delegates are responsible for bringing the ideas to a larger town meeting of Delegates only, up to 48 Delegates. As Mayor, I would listen to the Delegates, and enact their elections into law, unless I Veto or something similar.

> With Law Enforcement, I would have Police Officers attend these meetings to discuss policing and to prevent riots. Likewise, the Neighborhoods could talk with the Police Officers about policing objectives, which will be centered around Protecting At Risk Individuals, and teaching Citizens hows to Strengthen Each Other through training. Persons without a Job, without a Social Network, and Depressed will work with Police to get their life on track, while those participating in society work together to achieve the maximum possible through study and collaboration.

2) Education refocused to be centered on Human Achievement and high practical knowledge.

> Instead of a mix of historical subjects, history would be refocused to studying the lives of key individuals. Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Thomas Jefferson, Malcolm X, MLK, George Washington, John Winthrop, Thomas Paine, so on. Similarly, scientific subjects will be centered around the scientist making the discoveries.

> This is to remind children, and all, that humans create achievement. When you study the lives of these great people, it's clear that achievement was created over multiple years of a scientific lineage functioning together. Study of these role models, particularly at young ages, fills the mind with possibilities, that though they come from a lowly home, they could achieve the next wondrous discovery which could last for ages.

> Regarding practical knowledge, I would reorganize High Schools (ages 14 to 18) to focus on learning the skills necessary to get high paying jobs, and thus separate students into lines of study as they do in Universities. Middle Schools would be refocused toward Arts, Media, Expressions, and Communication. Elementary would be on learning of Heroes and Fore Fathers.

> This would be a minor change in the topics discussed (other than having block chain courses, and so on, in high school), but a major change in their presentation. The over all effective would create a stronger willed citizenry who have a definite purpose to their lives which they shall assign themselves before graduating high school and joining society at large.

3) Safe guard our Treasures and our Lives

> Treasure is what the elder generations must maintain and protect to pass down to younger generations. This includes ensuring that the young generation learns high paying skills, ensuring that investments gain value, and ensuring that the local community competes with the global community in such a way that our people grow to become global leaders.

> Regarding the safe guarding of life, this is where not only must we achieve in the ways of high science to compete globally, but we must also protect ourselves so that we possess the means necessary to create the basic functions of life. Such as Farming, Housing, Child Raising, Medicine, and so on.

**In Conclusion**, through reshaping communities to think locally in terms of governance, globally in terms of education and economics, and heroically in terms of parenthood and social responsibility, we can reshape a world that can exists within this one yet lead the way to the next New World.

Sadly, its the bigger economies like the eu and us that will likely drag their feet the most. War is more likely than open embracing it. Its going to be a rocky few years.. but expect big events, say russia and china trading oil in crytpo (even if state backed coins), mass adoption of decentralized exchanges, etc. Progress in the crypto realm will come from periphery economies, like Venezuela, Japan, etc who stand to gain more than to loose from crypto adoption.";7;1;False;pibechorro;dro4jjd;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

">PayPal, a centralized hub payment processor. Lightning network, a barely less centralized payment processor that uses one less middleman for processing payments between a business and an individual that relies more on the certain business who controls the off chain(which takes away from the point of BTC already) hub.

How is lightning ""barely"" less centralized when anyone can run a node himself if he wants. Even if there would be nodes who wouldn't want to make any money and block your transaction, your payment would find another route. You are not dependend on anyone if you don't want to and you still don't have to ask permission to send someone money. Furthermore there is no lightning company who can freeze your account or steal your funds.

Central banking on the scale we know it will most likely die this century and more likely sooner than later. They’ve pushed the fiat system to its limits. The world economy was almost destroyed in 2008 but they bought themselves some time by injecting trillions into the economy and keeping interest rates at zero or even negative for the next 8 years. The economy is now more fragile than ever and next time a crisis hits, and one will it’s only a matter of time, they have really no room to cut rates and I don’t think they be able to print themselves out of the whole again. Central banks are seeing accelerating inefficiencies when it comes to the productivity of new debt. During the period after 2008, it took $18 of debt for every $1 added to GDP.

"Hi Pine, 

I am absolutely thrilled to know your extension of love to humanity through the Pineapple Fund is not mainly about Tech.

I came across your recent fund on an article on inverse.com and it proves as an early adopter, you are a fundamental player in introducing a new world all together in charity through the crypto/ Bitcoin space. I was so touched and I still am while writing this very very long message (Sorry Pine :-)

I am particularly overwhelmed as Bitcoin from this part of the world where I come from in Africa is relatively a very very ""strange"" concept especially for charities here that are attuned to the traditional funding scheme and limited by bottleneck procedures regarding funding their initiatives.   Bitcoin is almost rocket science to most of these charities since it is not mainstream and the Pineapple Fund provides an unprecedented opportunity for charities making a difference from this part of the world to keep making a difference. Pineapple fund is just one of the few ways by which Bitcoin and blockchain is changing the world. 

What baffles me is your simplicity and your values. Its not spectacular, its just supernatural. Your generosity will certainly avert calamity in so many lives,  so many lives!

The setback faced by most existing  charities I've come across which is also a global setback , is that they emphasize more on the problem, rather than developing sustainable and long term solutions to address/solve/eradicate the problem i.e the transition from awareness charities to action-driven charities. Action as they say speaks louder than words!

Dear Pine, my point is your fund will create a greater impact for projects that create direct impact and are solution driven rather than just advocacy and awareness charities as it will be expedient to support action driven charities (this is not to undermine awareness charities at all). 

In Africa and particularly from where I come from, resilience builds up very easily especially due to the abstract IMF adverse conditions relating to access to basic funding sources . I will like to offer up a few insights to consider as to what challenges your funding can do to help local charities not only survive, but thrive:

- Much international aid goes through several levels of intermediaries and sub-contractors; relatively little funding winds up in the hands of the charities themselves, which makes it difficult for them to plan long-term prompting them to work on project-by-project basis to create maximum impact in the shortest while. Of course Pineapple fund defiles the traditional funding rules by accessing  these charities directly without unnecessary intermediaries or administrative bottlenecks. 

- Local charities have a better understanding of what does and does not work in a given community.  They have a more organic relationship with people at the community level and can communicate with them in more meaningful ways. They can launch programs more quickly than large organizations can. Their levels of trust within the community are more deep-rooted than those of international agencies whose personnel are “parachuted in” and wonder why they do not get the same level of receptiveness.
Most initiatives are community based because it is based on a common African philosophy called ""UBUNTU""  which means "" I am because you are""; thus  changing one life is literally changing a family and that resonates a ripple effect. 

- Indigenous local and national fundraising capabilities are not very developed within Africa so charities are dependent on external funding sources.
.....
Fast forward ;

Your initiative will really make the lives of action driven charity beneficiaries better than they would have imagined and expand their opportunities for a decent human life, transitioning  from victims to victors, from survivors to models of inspiration and dependency to autonomy. 

If you don't mind, I will wholeheartedly do what it takes to adhere to the vision of your generosity by investing my time and skills to screen and recommend such charities in this part of the globe where your fund will do a great good, restore hope and break the dependency cycle in charities from  diverse sectors that indeed make a palpable difference in their communities and creating just and fair conditions for every human life to be valued and upheld. If just one life benefits of your unmatched generosity, I will be forever grateful to have participated in changing a life indirectly.  

Pine, you're an UBUNTU figure par excellence. 

With much respect, 
Poiema

Although I'm curious how trade volume can be 100x greater than a portfolio unless you are just losing money left and right.

"No need to be defensive, we are just having a discussion. You also provided no points, just compared BTC to FB without saying why they are the same but I'll help you see why they are not.

BTC's innovation at this point is limited as a currency as it does not solve any existing problems for the exception of laundering money. The exchanges also work off chain which if you cannot see the problem with that you have no business being in BTC. BTC on the other hand is not regulated, the exchanges are susceptible to hacks. yes you should put your money in a wallet but most new players drawn in by FOMO don't know that.

Buying bitcoin is completely different from FB. Have you ever read a financial statement in your life? FB had $27 BILLION in revenue in 2016, billions of users on virtually every smart phone and is well established. Purchasing a share in FB is purchasing a share in that revenue stream as well as their patents and HUGE market share (they own insta etc.), future growth etc. FB will not go to $0 (not saying BTC will but it is possible it can). FB is also on a regulated exchange and adheres to the required regulation therefor protecting investors. 

As I've said before, I believe in cryptos and the technology but remain critical and try to remain objective.

I've established a category, it's just that the category doesn't have any demand. The claim I was responding to specifically was talking about bitcoins, not cryptocurrency as a whole. With bitcoin there is clearly currently demand. If some other coin comes in and fills the category better, no matter how scarce the bitcoin is there wouldn't necessarily continue to be demand for bitcoins. To take it to a crazy extreme: if the governments of the world got together and decided to execute every single person who tried to spend a non-approved cryptocurrency, demand would most likely fall despite any scarcity.  If the underlying protocol for btc was found to be catastrophically flawed, same thing. All I am trying to say, however inartfully, is scarcity alone does not create demand and therefore does not create value. Don't assume solely based in the scarcity of a bitcoin that it cannot ever be worthless.

"You have a ""gut feeling"" that it's going to screw you over.

I have no idea when you invested, but... did you research it?

The first time it hit $1000 was in late 2013, like.. December 2013.  It bounced around until Feb where it dropped, and kept slowly dropping, bottoming out at $200 in mid to late 2015. 

Keep that in mind - **everyone who bought in around the $1000 mark because ""it was going to the moon!"" watched their investment crumble to a fifth of what they paid over the course of a year and a half.**

The second time it hit $1000 was in January... of 2017.

So if you bought for $1000 in December of 2013, you couldn't recoup your losses until 2017.  Three years and some change later.

Now, depending on who you talked to, the price hit $17000something or $19000something.  It's now falling again.

I wouldn't be surprised for it to drop below $3000.

And it'll be above $17000 eventually.

You didn't invest so much that waiting three or more years for an actual increase is going to hurt you, right?  You researched it and understood the price history, the swings it makes and the lengthy recovery time, right?  It didn't slowly increase to $1000 that first time - the price of Bitcoin is a tale of incredible increases, dramatic drops, and it ending higher than where it started the run, sure, but taking years to get back above the prior high water mark.

"A word isn't copyrightable. It may be subject to trademark law. And trademark law doesn't forbid *all* use of a trademarked term. But you're introducing red herrings now; laws don't determine whether people counterfeit goods; whether it's profitable to do does.

>There are lots of ways for that piece of paper to be completely unique.

Uniqueness isn't enough. You need *resistance to copying* (whether legal or not). By anyone.

In one sense your word is perpetually unique, in the same sense that there is only one number ""42"". But then what matters isn't the exact identity of your token, but the *class* it forms part of. The question of scarcity then hinges around how hard it is to find *other* members of that class. I can make up other unique words and no trademark law will stop that, but you can't make up arbitrary Bitcoin UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) that other people will accept (which is the class relevant to bitcoin-scarcity) without proving their provenance in the blockchain.

Gold's scarcity is anchored in the fact that we know of no more productive way of finding new gold atoms than by digging them out of the ground. Pretty much all the elemental substances are like this, and the only difference in their scarcity is how much of the stuff there is around us. They could all be used as money, if we chose, but some are more and some less-well suited to this task.

"Thats nonsense. There was a push to make transactions less difficult and to make it an actual currency again and it led to a hard fork.  Asking people to use a currency LESS so it can be used for actual timely transactions is so ass backwards.  Bitcoin needed to get better at dealing with load, instead it did nothing and now that more of the market is taken over by trading bots, it is unusable as a currency, and is questionable as an asset/commodity. 

2 years ago I could take a bitcoin and buy some garbage off tiger direct. Today I can take a bitcoin and hold it and ... hold it some more I guess? It looks to me that the only places that BTC is still usable as a currency are darknet markets, which are shifting to BCH/eth, and ransomware payments.

So we have this storage of wealth, or commodity, or whatever you want to call it, that has no hard backing besides a network of miners doing busy work and some people believing its worth something. A stock has the value of a piece of the company you own, a bond is the idea that you will be paid back with interest on an investment, but bitcoin? What is this value you are backing and throwing your savings at?  What determines if next week will be a +$10k week and not a -30% week?  

As far as I can tell, and I've been a regular user of this shit for p2p transactions since I bought a few coins off MtGox in 2010, there is no rhyme or reason.

"**Recursive acronym**

A recursive acronym is an acronym that refers to itself. The term was first used in print in 1979 in Douglas Hofstadter's book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning ""GOD Over Djinn"", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym. Other references followed, however the concept was used as early as 1968 in John Brunner's science fiction novel Stand On Zanzibar. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into ""Eptification for Particular Task"".

A guy who paid $10 for 500 bitcoins 8 years ago has nothing to lose by telling you all to KEEP HODLING, and to BUY LOW, BUY HIGH, and that whatever price bitcoin is now will seem trivial to what it will be worth years from now so don't worry if you lose money in the short term.

The majority of bitcoins are owned by a small minority of bitcoin holders.

"There is no comparison between stocks and this speculative market of crypto. 

Many people hold stocks for the long term based on the company's history, its prospects, the current market for its products and services, its management and so on. If you perform value investing, long term investing barring a once in a lifetime event such as a market crash, your investments will mostly be stable, and even provide dividends.

Sure stock market buys can be gambling depending on the sector, the company, and all kinds of variables. But let's say you put your money in a blue chip, you can expect not to lose most of that money even if you leave it there for 5 years, and in some cases you can expect to get some returns as well.

This is a ridiculous argument. Gambling and investing are not the same thing. If I look at Apple who makes billions of dollars per year, owns thousands of very useful patents and has one of the most valuable brands in the world, that is not gambling, it is investing. If you purchase an ETF that tracks the SP500 and plan to hold for 20+ years, that is not really gambling, that is investing. If you purchase a digital token that has very little in the way of utility and can be easily replaced, in the hope it goes up in value, that is gambling.

You need to get away from particular items and concentrate on *categories* to reason about scarcity coherently. Otherwise everything is ""scarce"", because there's only one of every physical item.

">Anecdotally, when the price was pretty stable at ~$400 for years, I was using it as a currency. I bought Steam games and stuff on Overstock with Bitcoin. 

that's when supply was better matched to demand. Supply rate has halved since then while demand has more than doubled (and most of that demand has gone from people who want a currency to people who want 1000% returns on investment). The worse the gap between supply and demand grows (which is hard coded to the protocol), the more hyper-deflationary and unusable as a currency it will become.

>I want to see Bitcoin continue to inflate in value until it's large enough to stabilize and be just a gently-deflationary currency

How do you anticipate ""gentle"" deflation when you're going to keep halving the supply until eventually the supply will reverse (due to lost bitcoins) and yet you expect exponential growth in adoption of the currency (from less than 1% of the earths population to I'm assuming at least 10%, if not 50% or 100%)

> 2) because it will tend to grow in value over time, people will prefer holding BTC to USD or other currencies.

Just like how everyone uses gold as currency now because its grown in value but the USD hasn't? don't bring up frangibility or ease of payment as reasons why this hasn't happened because you can use trade gold digitally more easily and more cheaply than you can use trade bitcoin, almost no one does though. because its too deflationary, even when thousands of tons of gold are mined every year.

> But to fulfill the needs of an international economy, it has to have a proportional valuation, and the only way to reach that valuation is with big upward surges

Or supply of bitcoin could just be increased to meet demand so that market cap could increase without the individual unit price increasing which incentivizes hoarding and rent seeking which is actively harmful to its use as currency.";1;0;False;suninabox;drnr3gu;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

You don't need to buy currency years in advance in order for it to be usable.

If everyone starts using bitcoin then you'll get paid in bitcoin, anything you sell you will get paid for in bitcoin, you will have no problem getting bitcoin to use for currency. If you believe that anyone who didn't buy bitcoin when less than 1% of the population was using it will struggle to be able to use it when it is a mainstream currency, I'm not sure how you think it could ever be a mainstream currency.

If you honestly believed that bitcoin would be worth the same 5 years from now as it is today, why would you bother buying any to then not use for 5 years?

The only reason to buy in advance is because you believe you can rent seek on artificial scarcity.

">Care to share where and when you make the judgement on when a commodity becomes ""speculation and luck"" rather than an investment vehicle? 

When it demonstrates underlying value/demand.

The vast majority of demand for bitcoin is coming from speculators who believe it will be worth more in future, so buy today, which makes it worth more in future.

Bitcoin is unquestionably a less functional currency today than it was a year ago, so there's no question of whether this demand is coming from actual utility or from anticipated gains.

People can rationalize this away by saying things like ""lightning will fix everything"" and ""its not meant to be a currency, its a store of value"", but it doesn't change the fact that people are buying based on what they think bitcoin will be worth in the future rather than what they think it will be worth today.

This is why it can be described as a bubble, because if it never becomes worth what people think it will be worth then there will be a *drastic* re-alignment from what its worth when people think it will be worth far more in the future, to what its worth when people think its only as valuable as it is today.

There's been such rapid gains in price, that there's still lots of people who anticipate futher gains despite short term set backs. When people see 1000% gains in a year, that puts peoples risk tolerance up a lot, so they're willing to ignore dire indicators like bitcoins market share halving in a year, or losing 30% of its value in a day even when its supposed to be ""stabilizing"" as the market cap gets bigger.

This is all dependent on having more people who think bitcoin will be worth more in future than people who think it will be worth less. If only 20% of people lose confidence and sell, this might cause a short term dip but its not enough to deflate the bubble. As more and more speculators get involved, the total supply of potential speculators gets less and less, and then eventually you can hit a crash where more speculators leave than can be replaced be newcomers. We're probably not at that point yet but we're not far off.";2;1;False;suninabox;drnrwbc;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"Exactly. In this logic I've been ""HODL""ing coins that have been aimed at utility.

I'm playing the trading game- but thats because I want to end up with this shit in hand when I'm rocking a debt card and buying groceries with it.

At the same time so many people have been coming to me asking about bitcoin, I'll have them make an account on an exchange or set up a wallet and sell it to them for cash in hand.

I have mixed feelings about this since more people want to buy in and raises its exposure, at the same time the sky high prices and roller coaster trading defeats any function as an actual currency and does exactly that- makes it looks like some crazy money machine they don't understand.";2;1;False;AirFell85;drnd7ve;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"You can want both. I want to see Bitcoin continue to inflate in value until it's large enough to stabilize and be just a gently-deflationary currency. That means massive gains for now and a reasonable currency in the long run.

Anecdotally, when the price was pretty stable at ~$400 for years, I was using it as a currency. I bought Steam games and stuff on Overstock with Bitcoin. And then I bought an equivalent amount more Bitcoin to offset the sale.

This says two things: 1) if the price is stable, people will happily use it as a currency--and it works wonderfully (or did before the fees exploded), and 2) because it will tend to grow in value over time, people will prefer holding BTC to USD or other currencies.

When you see 10x jumps, that obviously fucks with things. But to fulfill the needs of an international economy, it _has_ to have a proportional valuation, and the only way to reach that valuation is with big upward surges. If and when we reach a point where things balance out, where the market decides it doesn't need another 10x rise or 50% drop, where we just see minor fluctuations up and down like you do with any currency (but still trending gradually up), then it's utility will have a chance to shine.

"> The absurdly high fees required to transfer bitcoin to an exchange clearly show it's no longer remotely viable as a currency. I can't imagine why anyone would want to throw more money in to it. The 25X gains in one year was certainly nice for me, but it's just baffling why anyone would want to buy at the top into a currency that no longer has any functionality as a currency.

The counter argument here is that the fees are just growing pains. And that other cryptocurrencies would have similar struggles under this level of adoption. While an outsider looking in might think Bitcoin is stagnating, there's [a lot of development going on](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master).

There are some vocal outliers, but it's generally accepted that fees are too high. There are also lots of people working on solutions. Perhaps that solution will be the Lightning Network, perhaps not, but there's a lot of fame and money to be made in this space.

In the meantime, the price of Bitcoin has put a huge ""bounty"" on Bitcoin exploits. Any SHA256 weaknesses or Bitcoin related bugs are literally worth millions of dollars.

The post you responded to was simply saying there comes a time when a smart person locks in their gains.

"Yes, spreading out your buys decreases standard deviation (or fluctuation)... *but there is no advantage in doing so*. If you buy all at once, you stand an equally-likely chance of buying on a dip as you do buying on a peak. Spreading them out, simply breaks the one time buy into several, each of which have the same probability as the first. Therefore, if you'd like your purchase price to be closer to the average price for that period, by all means Dollar Cost Average 'til your heart's content. My point is there is no *advantage* in doing so.

Right now, I think it's more of a commodity, closer to gold.  Gold was used as a currency for many, many years, but not so much any more.  Who knows what Bitcoin will be in the future, but right now, it's not a very good currency because it's not readily acceptable, which is one of the requirements for currency, I believe.  It has nothing to do with not wanting to spend it so much as not being able to.  I only got in to it a few years ago because I wanted to donate to a website that preferred it.  I left a little in a Coinbase account, and next time, it had gone up enough so I didn't even need to add to it.  That was when I started adding more, even though it was a ridiculous $500/coin.  :-) ;1;0;False;leftcoast-usa;drn0ykf;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"You're assuming I have all my money in Bitcoin?  No way.  I would never invest more than I can afford to lose in something I can't really measure.  The only reason I ever even got started was because I needed some Bitcoin to donate a few years back, and I left some in for later, where it went up a lot, so I invested a bit more over the years.  I liked the idea, and wanted to support it.  But if I lived in one of the high-inflation countries with no alternatives, I'd probably invest more - why not?

Anyway, I've already sold enough to cover my initial investments, so what I have invested now is just profit.   I buy small amounts when it goes down, like a few hundred at 12,000 recently using a limit order that I didn't even think would trigger ";1;1;False;leftcoast-usa;drng19l;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"So, speaking as an old-timer, I remember when people talked exactly this way about the Internet. Nobody was actually using it, it was all hype, the novelty would wear off. Look, some major site shut down--that proves it. Gopher is failing, and that ""world wide web"" stuff is too CPU-intensive to be useful. Established media companies and the government would never allow it to take off and replace them, or to provide unrestricted, untappable lines of communication. They'll step in and shut it down. In ten years, nobody would be using this 'Internet'! They'd be reading books and newspapers like always, and all that would be left on the Internet would be a few companies and universities.

"Anyone who claims that bitcoin is a sound investment is deluding themselves. And when they tell each other they are tough for being in and hodling (""hodl"" is getting as annoying as ""fake news""), it strengthens that delusion.

Bitcoin is a huge huge huge gamble that if it pays off by becoming money, can pay off huge. It's currently paying off by gambler buying. Nobody thinks money is this volatile or difficult/expensive  to transact.

Yes if you're willing to take the risk and make a bundle from the final play if it plays out, good for you. But don't pretend it's anything but a massive gamble. You're not tougher than everyone else. you're not smarter than everyone else. You're just willing to take a risk in the belief it will pay off. That's good enough. No need to marginalize non believers or sellers.

I hope you make a killing out of it. I really would prefer currency out of government's hands. I just think the chances of anything taking over fiat are very small. And a smaller chance is that crypto will be the replacement (could be gold, could be some other technology no one has thought of). And a smaller chance still that bitcion will be the crypto. And even smaller that bitcoin will be the crytpo forever.

There's a reason this sub says ""Submit link NOT about price"".

It's a speculative asset. No one gives a shit how useful it is they just care about how much money they can make from ""hodl""ing. If people didn't expect to make money from speculation to HODL. People only want to HODL while the price is going up, only then do they plan on actually using them. The very fact you're measuring bitcoins success in price:

>Bitcoin was $2500 this summer. <$1000 a year ago

and not how widely accepted it is, shows that you are one of these people who see's it as a free money machine.

you should not want bitcoin to increase in value when increasing in value deters people from spending it and leads to price surges and crash that ruin any confidence that it will hold a consistent value.

course then you have to start asking difficult questions about how bitcoin could simultaneously become more useful without rising in price, and you won't like the conclusion to that if you still want to make money off it.";20;2;False;suninabox;drn2gv8;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Lets say you have 100$ and you buy BTC when it has a value of 1000$. Now, you buy an altcoin for the 0.1 BTC you have. Now wether the altcoin goes up or down, you will gain or lose BTC. The price of BTC will fluctuate alongside that. So lets say you gained so much from your altcoins that you now have 0.2 BTC. But BTC is now worth 500$. You still have 100$.

Whether the contracts are settled financially or not - you could still get someone heavily enough invested to dump the top, creating the top, and then use the financial gain from the increase in value of the contract to cover the decreased profit from keeping up volume selling lower until the effect has snowballed and everyone is selling. Then sell the contract, increase their stack of btc and let it ride back up. There has to be some investment group with enough clout to do this. I'm probably wrong. No doubt there.

You have to remember people can be real assholes.  These laws are meant to make it so they can arrest people who buy up, or hold back on supplies to make them more scarce to drive up the price.

"Price-gouging can be a good thing - it is a reaction of supply and demand that makes sure resources are most efficiently distributed.

For example, it sounds bad to be selling cases of water for $100/each in Puerto Rico after the hurricane, we all agree with that feeling. But this price may accurately reflect the supply/demand relationship while also discouraging hoarding. 

If the price were to remain at $3/case the first people in line would likely buy more cases than they necessarily needed just to be safe. Whereas the people at the end of the line may have $100 but won't have any water at all because it is gone by the time they get to the front.

All feelings aside, is it objectively better for the person at the back of the line to have 1 case of water that they purchased for $100 or no case of water (and $100) because the supply was exhausted due to hoarding from the front of the line at an artificially low price?

Personally, I might buy 10+ cases of water for $3 each if I am at the front of the line just to be safe. If those same cases of water were $100 each, I may buy only 1 or 2 cases. Price-gouging has a negative connotation and feels wrong but it can actually lead to more efficient distribution of limited resources versus artificially low prices dictated by law.

Just something to think about.";2;0;False;CzarNicholasThe2nd;drn22rg;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png
"I've never really understood the logic behind those laws. In times of inconsistent or extremely low supply and extreme demand raising the price is the only means businesses have to slow demand down to keep a small portion of the population from hording. In an extreme hypothetical example: I have 50 gallons of the only clean water on an island with 40 families that just experienced a major catastrophe cutting us off from the outside world. I'm reasonably confident that since the storm has passed, boats are starting to run, and our highway service is clearing the roads off tonight I will get a shipment tomorrow, but with the communication situation being what it is I have no clue and regardless I can't help anyone with promises of water tomorrow maybe.

 I keep my water priced what it always is and one guy comes in and clears me out. I now have 39 families without water. If I limit the purchase to one gallon per customer that guy comes in then his wife, then each of 3 kids, and 7 other families do the same...now I have 30 families who'll go thirsty tonight. The ONLY way I can see in this situation to keep someone from finding a way around the system is raising the price to a point where they are forced to seriously consider how much they truly need to get through a day or so. 

The only non-price-gouging thing that jumps to mind is to charge the higher price, but provide a voucher to refund the extra money after the crisis.  I think that businesses shouldn't price gouge, but I feel like there's potentially dangerous problems caused by forbidding it. This only applies to necessities, I think the accusations people have made about Uber ""price gouging"" on New Years Eve in New York City was just insane.

\* My example isn't entirely realistic because in a community that small I'd probably know that guy, his wife, and three kids and wouldn't be fooled by that trick; but I think the underlying concept is accurate.

No, they only have intrinsic value, because we believe they have value. Just like we believe in the idea of ownership i.e. we trust that people will enforce it.

> I was just explaining how things have less risk then 100% when there is some utility not just accepted value.

I understand, and I'm trying to say to you that everything is 100% risk and that everything underlying this is the notion of trust that we take for granted. 

So in essence, they aren't really that different. Do I agree with you that material possession is so basic that understanding and trust in it is harder to shake than trust in Bitcoin? Absolutely. However, you risk in business or bitcoin can be similar depending on what is on the books. If there are a lot of losses and liabilities, well, all the assets on the book might be liquidated to appease the creditors.

Ultimately, my point is, investment in general carry risk of loss in most situations. ";1;1;False;YouAreSalty;drnop68;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/

"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"I can’t name the price, but I know sure as hell we haven’t reached the maximum potential.

Here’s the way I see it:

Imagine your workplace (or your neighborhood, school, etc.) Now think: how many people there own Bitcoin?

Now, if we assume Bitcoin’s *true* maximum potential - a cryptocurrency that all 7 billion people use worldwide - we’ll see that there’s an insane amount of growth to still be had.  

I’m no mathematician, but I think that’d be a huge increase. (If you’re really interested in this, you can check out [Metcalfe’s Law)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) 

Now, of course, that’s assuming that Bitcoin even gathers all 7 billion people. And that Bitcoin is able to scale up to that amount. However, the same could be said for any increase in userbase.. and that’s why, until Bitcoin is common, it will still have room to grow.

"**Hypotheticals**

Hypotheticals are possible situations, statements or questions about something imaginary rather than something real. Hypotheticals can deal with the concept of ""what if?""'. Grammatically, the term is a noun formed from an adjective, and the word can be pluralized because it refers to the members of a class of hypothetical things.

Hypotheticals can be important because they provide a means for understanding what we would do if the world was different.

From what I've read, everytime you spend bitcoin you have to pay taxes on the gains. For example if you buy $1 in bitcoin and then that same bitcoin grows enough to buy a $100 gift card. You would need to pay taxes on the $99 of growth. This essentially would have to be done for every purchase. If you didn't need to do this, it would be a huge loophole for avoiding taxes by just using the bitcoin to buy things directly instead of converting it to USD.;1;1;False;Vaggeto;drnzmse;Hopefully it gets over 20K;7llxmq;https://i.redd.it/axleegwdxk501.jpg

"Oh, I see. I thought you were older. I do think it makes sense to put a bit into crypto with every paycheck. However, never underestimate the gains from traditional investments. Compounding interest is a powerful thing. Take a look at this very handy calculator: https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator

Just as an example: You start with $1,000 and put in another $150 every month for 30 years. Assuming all gains are reinvested (i.e. you don't cash any money out) and a modest 5% average gain per year, after 30 years, you are looking at close to  $124,000. All that for just the price of an overpriced cable TV subscription. 


Crypto is tricky. It's by no means certain that the price of so many digital currencies will continue to rise at a steady rate. Why would it?

"LOL... I have to point something out here. I put a 'small portion' of my available funds into crypto, now my crypto is the largest portion of my portfolio, by far. Not even close. By small portion, I mean maybe 5%. 

Regarding taxes, my plan, not only for ctypto but for stocks too, is to cash out a yearly amount that won't result in a large tax hit. You only pay taxes on that income over a certain amount, right? And I think capital gains is treated as straight income, right? (I may be wrong there... not too worried about it.)

So when the time comes, I cash out a bit at a time. The approach is to have as little income as possible, whether via capital gains, salary, whatever.

Everybody doesn't hold. A percentage of all bitcoin owners are holders however. Most of the recent price increase was due to speculators buying in. Holders might not have bought since they could spot it was non-organic growth. When the market crashed and all those speculators sold out, the holders waited for the price to drop until they deemed it good to buy more. So, the people with hold mentality bought cheap coins from the panic sellers, thus lifting the price yet again but the coins are now held by strong hands (hodlers) instead of weak hands (speculators).;2;1;False;sz1a;dro8h44;My response to everyone who sold yesterday below 12k;7lnji5;https://i.imgur.com/pPdNZ3c.jpg

Holding long term is a decent plan IF the stock you are buying is RELIABLE. LONG TERM.

Like going long term in Apple, or Amazon that is a good plan. They will be here for a long long time yet and their stock is only going to go up.

It will take a long time for Apple to wither and die. They are simply too big.

Most people hodling Bitocin are hodlers. Most people in alt-coins are trying to get-rich-quick.  At some point they need to exit back to Bitcoin. Anything can trigger the panicking herd.  Also alts are highly correlated to Bitcoin, so if you want an alt to do well. You need that alt to win **and** for Bitcoin to do well.  

I own a small % of other coins, but 99% of alts in Bitcoin's history have gone to $0. I am sure that is the fate of 90% of the alts in existence right now.  Bitcoin is a medium of exchange. It makes sense its value would increase as the value of the network increases.

 I seriously do not understand the economics behind the valuation of many of the tokens (and I have spent a lot of time pondering it).  Even if they are successful, the tokens will still be worthless.

">Most people hodling Bitocin are hodlers. Most people in alt-coins are trying to get-rich-quick.

Hey, if you think most people holding bitcoin are not trying to get rich quick too you're wrong. Most people in crypto are trying to get rich-quick, a few really invest in the tech and look long term on it and don't care about loses or gains short term, specially with bitcoin having the issues it has now it is hard to invest on it for the tech, once those issues are solved that may change, there is very promising tech that is already working and proven right now. I was holding a big stack of XLM for a LONG time because i really love the project and what they have done even though the price had barely spiked, i love everything about it and i only decided to move that stack elsewhere because yes, i wanted to get rich, so i'm moving through alts right now. 

Yes alts follow bitcoin prices but that'll probably change very soon when exchanges start to implement new trading pairs and everything stops being directly tied to bitcoin, once that happens bitcoin will have even fewer effect on alts.

And yes lots of alts have perished, but most of them were scams to begin with, those with a solid whitepaper, a solid team behind it and already working products have been a success. 

Look at XLM and what they are doing and what they already have, they also have a few ATMs already around the world. Also look at ICX which is in its infancy right now, also has a promising future. As well as these two there are many more. There are also many more that are vaporware right now like cardano which has a great white paper but has nothing to show yet people speculating have brought the price up hugely.

"It started the revolution sure but now that there are a lot of better tech out there which has tons of more uses it either gets upgraded or left behind, you can believe it won't be replaced no matter what but just look at the past few months versus the past few years on how it has been going against the rest, more and more people will begin to see problems and more and more people will see the advantages of different alts, and as other alts start growing and bitcoin become stagnant people will jump ship, if it is not upgraded it'll die imo, it's a matter of when.

It has nothing unique besides being the first one, and the most accessible one currently as well as the one in front of the news more often, if that changes and regular people get the same access to other alts as they get to bitcoin, and they get to see what all do they'll make a pick and it'll for sure won't be bitcoin, unless bitcoin is upgraded, low fees and instant transactions is what we need and that will keep bitcoin on top even when it is technologically inferior, if that upgrade doesn't happen then the future of bitcoin is uncertain.

Just do your research on different alts, read their white papers and notice how they are superior to bitcoin, and not superior just because they changed one line of code like in the case of bch but superior because they are completely revolutionary and with very amazing technology.

"I don't know. I haven't researched it that deeply. Go ahead and knock yourself out if you wish. What I know is people can use it as a mean of fast, reliable and cheap medium of exchange and as an escape from fiat hyperinflation AND that they can't really use bitcoin for any of that at the moment. 

Bitcoin is not anything it promised to be, it's a broken speculative investment scheme. How can it help people in poor countries if the fees are as expensive as their monthly wage or higher right now? How can it be a reliable place to hide your wealth from the government if it's so unreliably volatile that you have to wait until the price is at least back to the point you originally bought to get back your money?

Ask yourself one question. Do you think general public cares how it works? No, they don't care about blockchain or cryptographic security or decentralized ledger only care how practical it is to them. If the corpocrypto (no such phrase on google, I invented it, neat :D) turns out to be more practical for the general public they're gonna dump bitcoin and visa alike and switch even if it won't be as secure and as independent as regular cryptocurrencies.

I am still impressed you can swallow that bitter pill, many crypto enthusiasts would find it hard to acknowledge that the future may not turn out to be their happy, libertarian version without fiat and bad banks and government control but (as often) a mix of various ideas, solutions and compromises instead. Many people here already exhibit a really magical thinking that is unable to compromise with exisiting reality (bitcoin is not gonna challenge fiat anytime soon, it's not even a currency now) and future developments (or lack thereof) will hit them like a truck IMHO.

"It's not decentralized and it's not exactly another fiat money. If their currency goes to shit even further this internet token stays still and saves value. Tbh I haven't delved enough into crypto tech to be the judge what is or isn't crypto. However the general public loves it and in the end they will be dictating whether cryptos will succeed in the long run or maybe be replaced by something much more convenient and tailored (and possibly not decentralized) to their financial and banking needs. Cryptos are not only competing with themselves and fiat. They are also competing with future solutions made by people who actually have fuckton ofresources and capital to get an edge.

I mean it all makes sense. In a thread yesterday some developer guy admitted that even though he is great enthusiast if he was at work and was dealing with rapidly growing market and said scaling solutions of their product will be operational within 18+ months he'd be fired on the very same day.

Once the big money finally understands the stakes and enters the game it might be very difficult for non profit projects like cryptos to succeed. Millions of people enjoy the benefits of eco cash and when the big capital enters the game and spends billions on a product that makes EcoCash (that is vastly more useful, safe and usable than bitcoin in the scope of Zimbabwe society) look like a bitch then they may make cryptos run for their money simply due to popular demand.

"Yes, we all want to scale. Every single crypto will have the same problem (or the same problems **and** more problems) as Bitcoin if they reached its level of use. I agree that there is no ""spam"" on the network.  A valid transaction is a valid transaction.  If you bid enough for block space and a miner puts it in, go for it.  

However, its very clear there was a large number of transactions, most likely sent (can't be certain), at a low Satoshi level (and higher), to purposefully elevate the mempool.  This did a couple of things for the miners:

 1. Coincided with social media and media FUD attack 1a: CNBC interviews with known felons (very unusual for CNBC) 1b: Citibank's statement, 1c: ""Found of bitcoin.com says Bitcoin is dead!"" spam on a bunch of MSM

 2. Raised the average fee for legitimate users panicking: benefit to the miners 2a: see chained transactions instantly sent to the next address. It is not impossible for these to have an economic purpose.  But for them to grow in such a large amount, at the same time as everything else, its pretty obvious what the intent is. If you want to close your eyes to that, you can. I don't care.

 3. Allowed them to promote competitor coins, which still allows them to cheat at mining through various methods (ASICBoost, participating in a mining pool and using the data as an advantage, etc. If you aren't technical they are tough to understand, but they definitely do exist). 3a: https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/asicboost-the-reason-why-bitmain-blocked-segwit-901fd346ee9f

There are a ton more examples but people need to do their own research. So there is no ""panic,"" there is no ""crisis."" Without this FUD and all the contrived transactions designed to incite panic and fear, Bitcoin would be totally fine (not to mention it will be even better when people start using SegWit).

"I've been buying and spending bitcoins for well over 5 years. I've lived through so many scary price movements that they don't faze me anymore, especially when they aren't caused by bad news.

I sold everything out of panic once, in 2013, when Silk Road was closed and it taught me a very valuable (though costly) lesson. The safest thing to do during a crash is to wait it out.

My bitcoins are safely in their wallet, I don't keep them at an exchange, so quick transactions to profit from the crash would've been costly and potentially dangerous. I spent over 1500€ though, 1000€ in BTC for my father, the rest in ETH for myself.

You can call bullshit, but you'd be wrong. If I believed that bitcoin was in any danger, I would've sold everything, but I know better. These price movements that happen for no good reason are the least likely to have lasting consequences.

Feel free to check my history, most of my comments on /r/Bitcoin are advising against idiotic predictions and panic.";1;0;False;Exotemporal;drnv9y9;My response to everyone who sold yesterday below 12k;7lnji5;https://i.imgur.com/pPdNZ3c.jpg

"Valid points. Indeed, Roger talking shit about bitcoin on social outlets for the world to see and saying it is basically a scam while advertising his clone didn't make much sense as noone would willingly put money in either at such a uncertainly situation. 

I really believe that's why alts are flourishing, the past few weeks they have gained so much market it's insane, and it'll probably won't go back to bitcoin anymore as it used to, now are people are both invested in alts and bitcoin, it used to be that everyone invested in alts to get more bitcoins. Even with this past crash there were a lot of alts that were basically unaffected when that never happened, when bitcoin crashed it used to bring everything down with it.

I think that's a strong sign that something needs to be done asap. I'm all in on ICX right now as i really like the project and so i think it'll continue to spike for a while, but my end goal is just to increase my bitcoin stack in the end and while there are probably a lot of people like me there are also a lot of people that are no longer thinking in terms of bitcoin but in terms of whatever alt they hold now.";2;2;False;eromeme;drnwi2o;My response to everyone who sold yesterday below 12k;7lnji5;https://i.imgur.com/pPdNZ3c.jpg

"That's logically sound investment strategy in anything that involves trading! 

A lot of short term experts that day trade stocks likely jumped on the crypto bandwagon for a quick buck before the new year. BCH just made it worse. But not understanding how crypto works they likely got caught up with transaction times/fees, how fast the ups and downs were (+-10% in mins), and holiday hype (the CNBC bitcoin's joke, panic machine was in full tilt). I'm sure a lot bought at 18k and sold yesterday for a panic loss thinking like it's wall st. And now it's back up to reasonable levels today.

Basically know your acceptable risk before you make a move.

"I honestly didn't see it coming.  
I knew the mempool is full. I take a look at it every single day. I knew why it's full. I knew it could get worse. However it just doesn't bother me much. Why? Because I know that it's worked on.  
I know that I might need to wait for a solution and I am fine with it.  
I bought Bitcoin because it's the money of the FUTURE not today's money.  
It just doesn't have the network technology behind it to make it possible today.  
But very smart people, much smarter than I am, are working very hard on it.  
So, I didn't see a dip all the way down to 12k.  
I thought about selling some of my satoshis when the price was nearly 20k so I can realise some profit, so I can secure at least a little bit my initial investment.  
As I was buying over time, every week or two, I've put my money gradually.  
So I though, maybe I should be taking them out gradually as well.  
Something like take 10% ones I've doubled my money according to BTC current price.  
Then ones the price of the owned BTC is 250% of the value of the money put in cash out another 10% of the initial investment's worth of BTC so now I am risking only 80%, while having about 90% of the initially bought BTC, etc, etc.  
However I didn't cash out any at near 20k.  
Now I've changed my opinion as we already had our ""correction"". I am not cashing out any until 30k, as I don't see another big dip until another big number like that.";3;1;False;RG_PankO;drnpeqh;My response to everyone who sold yesterday below 12k;7lnji5;https://i.imgur.com/pPdNZ3c.jpg
