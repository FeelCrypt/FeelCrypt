2) they didn't get in earlier on, feel it's too expensive now, and are doubling down on it failing one of these days.  these are the people who think you need to buy a whole bitcoin.

I agree with your emphasis that this is a high risk investment. That should be made clear to everyone. Therefore, it's wise to put in only what we can afford to lose. But your one-size fits all approach is myopic. It's up to each individual to decide how much risk they want to take on.

">Unless you're very wealthy or very young, you shouldn't have more than ~5% of your total invested assets in something as volatile as crypto.

This is wrong. I and others I know have had almost all assets in Crypto for more than 2 years. It wasn't a mistake nor an accident. Only people that don't understand their investment say what you've just said, because if someone realized where this space was going, they'd have behaved similarly.

A couple of months ago Bitcoin was at something like 2000USD and someone made a thread ""I want to invest all my savings, 20k into Bitcoin"". So many people told him not to do it. I told him ""Right now is the best time to do it"" (obviously in more detail) it got something like 25+ upvotes in a sea of posts like yours above....Bitcoin then doubled in price. 

Bitcoin isn't a stock/share, it isn't a company - its a totally new instrument/utility and even revolution in the eyes of some people. To have fully understood it potential at its inception, with decent capital, was to be a multi-millionaire today - that is a fact.

"Coinbase also lets you link a bank acct if that's an option.  Honestly though I'm not sold on coinbase yet - it's a wallet that sacrifices control and (potentially) privacy in exchange for ease of use.  At the most basic level, all you need to do is 1) get a wallet and 2) put coins in it - since 2) sounds like the roadblock, I'd start here, from the sidebar:  https://bitcoin.org/en/buy where I found this: https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/

Technically I guess you could use Coinbase as a wallet.  It's just a long string as an address to send money to that looks like: ""12g2bmbpkY7yf948ekWb1UnBA6jkEYMdSy"".   That's mine, and I can paste that in plain sight without worrying about someone accessing the BTC there because you need a private key to make a transaction (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key).  Private keys are what connects any wallet to its rightful owner, and are meant to be as securely protected as humanly possible.  I guess Coinbase ""takes care of my private key"" for me, I have no idea what it is.  When you get a wallet, I believe a private key is generated for you.

I don't know *nearly* enough to make any recommendations, and there is a lot to learn.  Right now, I'm looking into hardware wallets that support SegWit as a starting place, and eventually use it as ""cold storage"" to keep my BTC off of any network.

">First of all the only acceptable scenario where you'd be working a minimum-wage part-time job is if you're still in high school.

You're the one who started by using those parameters. I just did the math with them. I was just using the example you gave me.

>Now for your situation. You're a double income household with a young child. Your incomes are significantly above minimum wage. And you're telling me that you're living in poverty? 

Yes. That's what I'm saying. Technically I live above the poverty line, but so close to it that I do qualify for a bunch of shit.

>Let me guess you took out a 60K loan for a wedding? 

My wedding cost me about $2000. Some of my family and my inlaws also helped out to a tune of ~$500. so my wedding was great at ~$3000. Out of all your assumptions, this is probably the most insulting.

>You spend 10K on holidays every year? 

Where do you even get this shit? No. We spend a little out of our savings for gifts for family, and the once-every-2-year vacations are less than $1000. We might be poor, but we're not fucking stupid.

>A gambling habit perhaps?

Holy shit. I was wrong. This is the most insulting one. 

>If you want to prove me wrong, list out your combined incomes and an outline of your monthly expenditure.

OK. It'll be at the bottom.

>You have a child and only $1k in savings? That's just terrible honestly. You don't have life issues, you have spending and money management issues. Your cash flow is probably very badly managed

Oh, I'll admit right now that I haven't always been great with money. I learned bad habits from my mom, and no habits from my dad. It took me 5 years to accept that I needed to get better with money and another 5 to get even close to being actually well-minded with it.

**YEAH. I GET IT. MY SITUATION IS TERRIBLE.** Do you not understand that life sucks for some people? I'm constantly afraid that either my wife or I will have a major injury and not able to keep working, affecting my child. I live a much less fun life because I am more averse to taking risks.

>I literally cannot understand how that is possible. There are plenty of 15 year olds with more savings than that. Think about that. I had saved more than that working as a paper boy at like 13 years old.

I have a feeling you grew up middle class, and someone taught you about money before you graduated high school. I grew up poor and the only thing I got was my mom mishandle every dollar she got.

>Even early in my career, when I was on like 32K a year living with a housemate I was still able to save over 1K a month and whilst I was living modestly I was no pauper

Yeah, I graduated in 2011. During the worst depths of the financial crisis. 6 years later and I'm still ""early on in my career""

>**32k** 

I have *never* made this much money in a year. See before RE: life situations.

>not even really that impressive. 

Sure, but if I got to where you are, it would be pretty fucking impressive, becuase of how far behind I started.

The math of my budget:

Income (rounded to nearest 100 for ease of use, and these numbers are *after* taxes are taken out): 
Me: $1200 every 2 weeks
Wife: between $450 and $550 twice a month. We'll average it to $500 every 2 weeks.
Total per month: $3400

Costs:
I'm going to use August as the sample month. I am going to modify bills that are monthly but still change to the average (example: utilities, COBRA payments)

Anything that I have *italicized* is something that I am grouping under ""Life Issues"" that are either in the past and I am still paying for, or in the present that I have to continually deal with.

Rent: $825 (*really* fucking cheap for a house big enough for all 3 of us)

*Storage unit*: $65 (needed this to store and treat bedbug-afflicted items)

Hobbies: $30 (some computing stuff and some knitting)

Groceries: $438 (this includes diapers and similar regular needs)

Fast food: $151 (yes. this is a sore spot in my budget. Even if it were 100% eliminated, it would still be pretty far 
from what you are describing I should be at)

Gas for cars: $158 (we both commute)

Daycare: $400 ($50 per day, twice a week, every week)

*Healthcare*: $650 (I'm on a COBRA plan from an old job. This would be about 1/3 the cost if I had a decent plan 
through work. But I don't.)

*Paying old healthcare bills*: $100 (even on ~good~ great plans, they don't pay for everything. Going to be 
paying this much for at least the next 6 months or so.)

*Credit Card Payment*: $25 (I italicize this because most of the debt on it is due to the bedbug situation I am 
finally out of, or a healthcare bill -paid separate from the other healthcare cost listed)

Utilities: $135 (water paid quarterly, electricity and gas averaged and paid monthly)

Cable: $50 (no other choices in my area)

Phones: $76 (2 phones with minimal plans at $38 each/mo)

Other costs: ~$100 (birthdays, parking meters, other incidental costs.)

EDIT: OH SHIT. I FORGOT ABOUT MY STUDENT LOANS: $80 (after being reduced to an income-based repayment plan)

And finally, the $200 for savings.

"Thanks for the reply I appreciate that you took the time to list that out. I apologize if my previous post was harsh.

We've confirmed that you had some poor financial role models early on and made some poor decisions and also had some unexpected issues that cost you quite a bit. At least it seems like you're slowly turning things around and the fact that you have a clear picture of your monthly income and expenditures is a good sign. There's no denying that American healthcare is fucked. In Australia I pay about $120 a month for private health insurance (which isn't compulsory) and that seems expensive, $650 USD is crazy.

There's definitely a few expenses which you can cut down on, but really if I were you I'd really focus more on increasing you and your partner's earning capacity because there's no denying that 40K is not much to stretch between a family of 3. Once the debt and emergency funds are in place, I'd take that surplus and invest all of it into yourself (or your partner) to increase the amount of money you make. Whether it be self-education, formal education, a new suit etc. Really that should be the primary focus of someone on that household income IMO.

The measly returns you'd make on investing 200 into bitcoins or shares or w/e are nothing compared to the long-term returns made from say education which doubles your income.";1;1;False;herpherpthrowaway243;dmfq24s;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg

It is extremely rare that this works out like they think it will.

Maybe bitcoin is that big new thing.  The likelihood is that it is not.  I had a cash out level.  I did.  You should consider at what level you would consider cashing out at least a portion and exchanging for real property.

The world works by probabilities.  If something has a high likelihood of success, do it.  Bubbles have a high likelihood of crashing.  Bitcoin is a bubble.

"eidt: grammar

I can't tell if you're a troll or an asshole.... r/gatekeeping

##So let's do the fucking math.

Minimum wage job in my state (ohio) pays 8.15. Part time hours are usually considered anything less than 35/week.

That's $285 per week. Let's say they lose 10% to taxes (which is a *little* generous). so $256 per week. (I'm rounding down to the nearest dollar, btw)

That comes out to $1026/month.

The cheapest apartment I have ever lived in in my town was $525/month, utilities not included.

Let's say you have cheap utilities and only pay 100/month for them, including water, electric, and gas.

Then 50/week in food - this is pretty bare bones. Boring sandwiches for lunches and half-way interesting dinners.

My town is pretty well dispersed, so everyone drives. $100/month for minimum legal insurance, and 75/month for gas because your car sucks.

Then you get student loans - and lets say it's on an income-based repayment plan but not the best one - after all if you only have a minimum wage job, then your luck is pretty shit. $100/month

But we left out the phone! And internet! How can you invest in bitcoin with no internet?

I have the cheapest phone plan I know of, and a close-to-basic internet plan. 38/mo for the phone and 50/mo for the internet.

The rest of it you dump as fast as possible in to bitcoin. roughly *negative* 12/month is left for this.

**So you fucking tell me where a person on minimum wage working part time is going to get paid $12 per month in bitcoin.**

I'm married and have a full time job. My wife has a part time job. Both are significantly above minimum wage. We also have a toddler.

We don't have an emergency fund, because being poor is really fucking expensive. Cars break more often. Kid gets sick. Your wife *develops* a gluten sensitivity (how the fuck does that even happen?). You get BEDBUGS and have to trash 80% of your furniture as you move out.

After our medical bills, Student loan payments, daycare, fixing the fucking car, and so forth, We can save about $200/month. when we get done with medical bills, it's going to go up by about $150/month.

We put that in to a traditional savings account, because it only has $1000 in it - and we are filling up our emergency fund before *anything* else, becuase the principle is that **you only buy as much crypto as you can afford to lose.**

So fuck you saying that I've got spending issues. I have life issues. And they are fucking expensive.";17;3;False;superkp;dmfff2k;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg

If your coins are on coinbase, get them off of there and onto a paper wallet. When they are on CB, you don't possess the private key. CB does. This kinda means your coins don't belong to you 100%.

"First of all the only acceptable scenario where you'd be working a minimum-wage part-time job is if you're still in high school. And chances are if you're in high school you're living with your parents and have minimal expenses so that $1K a month is mostly disposable income. Your example is stupid.

Now for your situation. You're a double income household with a young child. Your incomes are significantly above minimum wage. And you're telling me that you're living in poverty? Let me guess you took out a 60K loan for a wedding? You spend 10K on holidays every year? A gambling habit perhaps? I refuse to believe that someone with reasonable spending habits on your household income is only able to save $200 a month. That's utterly ridiculous. If you want to prove me wrong, list out your combined incomes and an outline of your monthly expenditure.

You have a child and only $1k in savings? That's just terrible honestly. You don't have life issues, you have spending and money management issues. Your cash flow is probably very badly managed.

I literally cannot understand how that is possible. There are plenty of 15 year olds with more savings than that. Think about that. I had saved more than that working as a paper boy at like 13 years old.

Even early in my career, when I was on like 32K a year living with a housemate I was still able to save over 1K a month and whilst I was living modestly I was no pauper.

I'm 30 now, and on a reasonable wage. I live comfortably and spend quite liberally but I'm still easily able to save between 3 to 8K AUD per month depending on the month. My GF also works and saves more than that. Not saying that to brag or anything it's not even really that impressive.

"Do you think Bitcoin is currently undervalued? If so, then start buying. You might get that opportunity to buy again at $4k, you might not. So the best strategy might be to implement some sort of dollar cost averaging. 
You can consider buying now a ""hedging cost"" for not missing out on any further gains. If it does start dropping you can start dollar cost averaging on the way down. If it doesn't start dropping at least you are involved to some degree. 

You can base the allotments of each buy on how confident you are on the current price. Not confident this price is sustainable and $4k will come? Then only do 10% of your planned investment now. Reanalyze accordingly for each buy.

Don't hate yourself bro. Chances are if you would have bought $500 worth of bitcoin at $2 each there's no way you would of held that purchase until it reached 1 million. Chances are you would of took profit when your $500 turned into $1,000 or $5,000, or definitely at $10,000. It's just human instinct that forces you to take profit at some point. Also there's always opportunities on the market, right now there companies trading on the exchange for $1-$2 a share that could possibly be worth $1,000 a share in 2035! Gotta just keep hunting down opportunities and go with your gut when you feel something has tremendous potential.

The experiment has a while to play out yet. 

I reckon we'll have investment firms and perhaps even governments ~~investing~~ converting some currency soon, and then mainstream adoption at sites like Amazon, companies like Uber and so on.

The biggest hurdle yet to come will be governments possibly banning it because of its disruptive nature. While that couldn't kill bitcoin it could completely cripple it and send it back to the realm of tinkering computer nerds again, and tank the exchange rate. That's still at least a year or more away though, and if anything looks more likely to not happen.

It happenned. Okay, this one was a big joke. But I am confident that the next vulnerability will be exploited much more wisely.
Even mature open source projects are not immune to security issues. I don't see why Bitcoin and Ethereum should be any different than Linux, OpenSSH or OpenSSL.
And I am not even talking about smart contracts...

BTW, thanks, but I don't hold anything on exchanges. Everything's offline.

"Since this reached r/all, if you're interested in learning a bit more about Bitcoin, here's a couple videos that are great introductions:


[This video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4) is a great introduction to how it works, especially the math and game theory of Bitcoin. Nice lay introduction, but covers all the fundamentals that any user needs to know.  


[This video](https://youtu.be/l1si5ZWLgy0) is more about specifically why so many people think this is such an exciting technology. It's by a guy called Andreas Antonopoulos, who has a great understanding of both the technical aspects of bitcoin and the economics of it. He's good at explaining why it's so exciting, but also doesn't fall prey to a lot of the hype and cliches that are pretty endemic.
