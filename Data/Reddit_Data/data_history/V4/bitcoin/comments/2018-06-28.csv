">7 billion people     
     
While bitcoin is permissionless, it's probably safe to take the world's newborns, infants, toddlers, and young children out of the equation. So, let's start with 5 billion?     

>1. Do an on-chain transaction to receive Bitcoin
>2. Do an on-chain transaction to set up a LN channel     
     
It's possible to receive bitcoin and set up a LN channel in the same transaction, so we can cut that multiplier in half (you can double my end result if you want to also include closing transactions).    
     
>3. Potentially have enough transactions available to prevent a bad actor from closing channels too quickly. 
     
Not sure what you're talking about with #3. Maybe you meant ""channels"" instead of ""transactions""?     
     
>So, sticking with just 2 transactions each, that's 14 billion transactions. 
     
...with our revised numbers, we get ""1 transaction each... 5 billion transaction"" 
     
>At 3 transactions a second     
     
3tps is an estimate based on legacy (non-segwit) transactions. With blocks containing 100% segwit transactions, that estimate climbs to 7-8tps. Let's call it 7.25.     
     
>that's 4,666,666,666 seconds.     
     
""690,000,000 seconds""     
     
>77,777,777 minutes     
     
""11,500,000 minutes     
     
>1,296,296 hours     
     
""191,667 hours""     
     
>54,012 days

""22> years""     
     
>Just to get everyone to use lightning. And that is with a single channel per person. Lightning will not scale.

"I didn't invent any of this. It's all in the objective description of how capitalism works in Capital vol. 1. 

Enforcing value of what? Of the obligation? Government will seize an asset from you worth the amount of your obligation if you don't meet it. What else do you think enforces anything? It is done by the brute force of the law we agree to abide. A government does not enforce the value of money abroad. Markets determine that. Markets determine the value of all commodities, be it foreign currencies or Bitcoin. What the government wants back as obligation is politically arrived at. It follows no economic law. A government could decide to not tax you and give you a free ride, but a free ride to you when another man has an obligation is not a happy state of affairs. When Greece is determined to be giving a free ride to its citizens it is punished by markets in commodity exchanges of foreign money to say, we aren't going to accept this lazy Greek person's money in exchange for our hard working obligation laden citizen's work. Markets reward the places where obligations are strongest. It's the sum of all the obligations that float the economy. 

When we borrow we get into an obligation we have an interest to not ever borrow so much that we would fail to meet our obligation. That would makes us appear as weak to a foreign trader if everyone was defaulting on their obligations.

Governments decide what level of obligation is applied to you for their well being. It tries to balance lots of private sector affluence with maintainable amounts of debts (obligations) of its own. Governments trade in their own obligations top as participants in a community of nation traders that can benefit from liquidity this way to deal with foreign trade account imbalances.";1;1;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1fxw3j;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

"Money gets its value from obligation. That is not an false view of things. It is how it is. The way countries work is not what you think it is. You must sign on to be a citizen and accept obligations. Those have a value put to them. This is the underlying value of money. It has always been this way. 

In Sumer 5000 years ago, you would have accepted an obligation as a nomad wanting to enter civilization. A piece of land and the means of working it would have been given to you in exchange for a portion of the harvest on the threshing floor. The deal was set in clay tablet which was the first money. It was kept in storage. It represented your obligation to the ruler. The ruler was able to turn to mercenaries and say: for your protection I promise you this much wheat that these obligations that I give to you will guarantee you. That was trading in obligation. You do the same.

The government doesn't care how you come up with the means to meet your obligation, but it puts a price on it. It enforces that obligation so ferociously that all can trade in the clay tablet equivalent that is money.

You may think all this has changed, but nothing has. Money is not commodity in nature, but it can be traded as commodity if one wishes. We do that when we don't simply use money to meet obligations.

"**Lindy effect**

The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time. In contrast, living creatures and mechanical things follow a bathtub curve where, after ""childhood"", the mortality rate increases with time. Because life expectancy is probabilistically derived, a thing may become extinct before its ""expected"" survival.

The way you are using bitcoin is reliant on both fiat and centralized bank interchanges to work.

It directly contradicts the idea that fiat and centralized banks are worse than bitcoin and need to be replaced by bitcoin if you're saying the best way to use Bitcoin is to get a company to sell it for fiat and then transfer fiat.

>That people stigmatize how I spend it is silly and only hurts Bitcoin adoption.

Continuing to use fiat and banks isn't going to increase Bitcoin adoption. At best it could increase use of Bitcoin as a speculative asset that is sold for fiat which is actually useful as currency.

"I never agreed with the idea that Bitcoin is better than Fiat and the current banking system. Sure, it’s better than Fiat at certain things. Long term storage of value, making international payments with no questions asked, holding wealth in a way that cannot be seized. But in terms of everyday spending, Bitcoin is not ready and a hassle. I’d have to sell it for Fiat anyways, this is the most convenient method.

I’m happy to use Bitcoin on chain when the use case calls for it. That doesn’t happen very often.

And to criticize people for using Bitcoin debit cards as relying on the banking industry when Fiat exchanges are necessary and will likely always be necessary is just ridiculous.";2;0;False;ChuckSRQ;e1fs6t3;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg
Nope. Commodities get their value in such a way. Foreign money can be traded as commodity. That is why I think you need to study the objective workings of capitalism. Money is more than commodity, though. It is standard of value. Standards of value don't fluctuate in markets. You cannot push a market into the place/condition where you as a citizen no longer have an obligation to a government. The rich may think they ought to be able to do this, but that is really just a libertarian dream. Enough failure to meet obligation will lead to the collapse of government and money within a country. In the US you are on the hook for debts for a very long time, the full force of the law is used to enforce obligations and governments intervene when the risk to sovereignty is present. It is why the US dollar is closest to being an international standard of value, if there was such a thing. What is value there is the quality of the meaning of obligation to citizens. Places where the government can ask and get people to die in defense of the place have got a very acute sense of obligation to their country.;0;1;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1fwhj4;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

You have no choice but to want them. What part of that don't you accept. The standard is forced upon you in your citizenship agreement. You have no choice but  to settle in government money even if you are paid in turkey feathers. The great collective need for money makes it be the standard. Everyone can relate to this need and makes sure he prices his labor output accordingly. If he doesn't he will be working for nothing more than meeting his obligations. If he doesn' t even do that he will lose his assets. It is not the market that will intervene with your life if you fail to pony up it is the apparatus of the law.

"There is momentum in such trading. How long that persists is usually defined by specific events. One cannot reason currency trading when it continues to do things based in momentum. A good example of this is when the British currency was being attacked some years ago. The movement can be pushed with more momentum. No one has any interest in trying to overcome momentum it cannot quantify. market participants are guessers.

Currency trading is market based. It isn't based in anyone's obligation to a governing body. People trade foreign money as commodity in these markets to deal with market realities in trading goods. Where money is based, its intent is to give you the means to meet your obligation to your society. It isn't market based. You agreed to this concession by being a citizen. It is the price of admission we can all then put a value to and trade in. There is no market for citizenship where one can weaken the promise of money to meet obligation. In foreign trade countries where the obligations carry no weight are not favored over countries where they do. A lawless county doesn't benefit from great standing.

To understand money you don't start with markets because money starts with governments. Money is standard of value in a specific country. You can't become a standard of value by just trading in a market. Bitcoin has no possibility of ever displacing money unless governments decide to have it as the only way to settle obligation. As it is now you must sell Bitcoin in a market to get some money to meet your obligation.
