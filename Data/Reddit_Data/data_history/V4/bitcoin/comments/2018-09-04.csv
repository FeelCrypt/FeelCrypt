Sure, and - as said - this isn't the first time, nor is it even the longest period of time that it's done so.  This is nothing new or special.

>What indicators (other than anecdotal subreddit hype) are there that bitcoin will actually turn around again

1. Mining hash rate increasing over time.
2. Number of transactions increasing over time (although batching makes this harder to measure).
3. Increasing regulatory oversight/interest.
4. Increasing ease of use.

Not that any of these actually matter though because I don't really give a damn what the exchange rate is.
