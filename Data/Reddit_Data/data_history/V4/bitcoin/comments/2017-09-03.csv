"You seem to have taken offense to my response. We are not talking about how fortunes are made, we are talking about what bets people are willing to take with their livelihood. Of course the answer is inherently subjective (objectively), because it is up to the individual to choose what to do. And I am not talking about the $1 scenario - I am talking about the 100k scenario. Different people have different standards/preferences on lifestyle and happiness, so I think you are being shortsighted and naive saying taking the bet is ""objective reality"". Can you seriously not see how some people would not want to risk losing everything at the expense of potential infinite wealth? What about a family that depends on you?

Congratulations, you just made an  complete and utter fool of yourself.    

I wasn't talking at all about what your odds are. And of course they don't change with every other toss.  
But the law of large numbers has nothing to do with it.    
I said that the law if large numbers only **apply** when you have multiple trails:  
  
""The law of large numbers is a principle of probability according to which the frequencies of events with the same likelihood of occurrence even out, ***given enough trials or instances***."". 
  
In this op's case he didn't have multiple trails he had only **one**.    

And what I'm saying is that you are an idiot to make that bet if you only have one trail.

"You're not addressing the argument - whether or not his decision to take out a loan against home equity was ""idiotic"".

There is no question it was risky. 

Of course the argument hinges on the definition of idiotic. If you define ""idiotic"" as a category of risk, ie all actions taken at very high risk levels are the definition of idiotic, well, okay.

This is not a universal definition of idiotic though. Use of the word ""idiotic"" implies an action that was thoughtless, random, irrational, not made based on any reasoning etc. By this (more universal) definition, any idiotic act resists analysis because looking at it can't tell you anything useful.

But we need to reconcile the fact that he took a really big risk AND he made $600K. Just saying ""he was lucky"" or ""he was an idiot"" is fine I guess, but how does it help YOU make more money in the future?

If someone wins the lottery there is no point analysing their ""system"" because winning the lottery is almost perfectly random. But there was a reason this guy decided to go ""all in"" on Bitcoin at that moment. 

The standard wisdom is ""past performance is not an indicator of future gains""... but what if that's not actually true of Bitcoin? What if detailed analysis of every person who bought big at certain times reveals useful information that can help us know when to buy in and when to take profit? I'm not saying there IS, I'm just saying that dismissing every ""big winner"" as a lucky idiot is shortsighted.

More generally I think we need to develop a more sophisticated and nuanced way of thinking about and talking about people who take really big risks and win. It's not enough to say ""pffft, idiot"". You need to look at their actions and ask yourself why didn't you do the same. For instance, this guy's experience - sure you wouldn't put your HOUSE on Bitcoin, but does the increasing number of ""big winners"" make you more confident in increasing your level of risk, given that the reward is so high?

Maybe, maybe not. That's up to you. But it should be a decision based on more than just say ""that guy was an idiot.""";2;0;False;;dmhm0q0;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

"No, it's very distinct from both a lottery (total randomness, no guaranteed winner) and gambling (players paying in hopes of winning a prize). YOU may think it's too complex to analyse and thus it FEELS like chance, to you, but it isn't.

Just a note on casino gambling though - the important point is that casinos don't just ""take a cut"". If you played in a casino for infinite time, you have a 100% certainty of losing all your money because the games are constructed to favour the house over time.

The longer you play, the more you lose. The only way to ""win"" is to stop playing.
