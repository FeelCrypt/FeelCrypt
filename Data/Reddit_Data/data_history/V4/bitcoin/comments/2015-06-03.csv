I find it adorable how people have faith in their systems. There is NOTHING that can not be hacked by a motivated person/group.;1;1;False;ZanielZ;crugos4;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced
"I love the shit out of it. We don't go around ""embarrading"" ourselves by letting multiple-murder-for-hires go unpunished like they would in the utopian future of AnCapistan. We also don't believe that some guy running a billion-dollar drug market, selling weapons, poison, counterfeit cash, and every kind of dope is a ""hero.""

Apparently we must be missing the part where Mexican drug lords are also heroes, trying to change the status quo through the incredibly effective method of ""doing nothing at all to change the law, but making a lot of money keeping it in place."" Or are they not heroes because they aren't young, white, incredible privileged libertarian nutcases? You're right, brown people can't be heroes like Ross Ulbricht can, even though they are doing the same shit.

I'm just glad that reality sides with us, the sane people, who think that trying to have someone tortured to death, have someone's innocent roommates killed, and running a drug empire are actually crimes and not acts of benevolence. It must hurt to have reality lined up and firmly disagreeing with you on every topic; knowing that it will never change in your lifetime because your ideals are fucking insane and NO ONE wants them in practice. Meanwhile, I will enjoy the fact that I find reality to be comfortable and agreeable.";1;1;False;gerradp;crudjpm;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

AFAIK Ross has not been charge for murder. Secondo Silk Road was not a multi billion marketplace. Check your facts bro. I forgot that USSRA doesn't need proofs to incarcerate people That's why you americunt are all for your patriot act. Americunts are so afraid of drugs they are willing to sentence life jail for non violent crimes. This country is run by fear.
