 it's like bitcoin is some kinda non\-giving up kinda phenomenon, and  if you want to invest in future trchnology without any risk of failure then you should use Socratus, a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. Having studied the project I can say that it is reliable, has a transparent team.They seem really interesting but would love to hear your opinion.;1;0;False;BlockchainGuruu;dzxigqh;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
That's is prediction. He predicts it would go to the right. Who knows, maybe he's right\)\). And my prediction is. that you should invest in crypto and  if you are looking for a good and promising project to invest you should take a look at Socratus they have a really fascinating concept \- a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple.   I think this is really cool and it seems like innovative and demanded project ;1;0;False;CcryptoAdviser;dzymh3f;There are 180 different scenarios where bitcoin go.

It wasn't a bad deal. It became the first \(documented\) purchase and paved the way for future adoption. and if you want bitcoin to buy more you should pay attention on Socratus,  that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. With this ecosystem, companies will be able to cut operating costs, create new insurance products, deal with data analysis more efficiently and many other benefits. Right now, it is on the stage of private token pre\-sales. And I think that it is rеally worth investing in. ;1;0;False;BlockchainGuruu;dzypb5e;Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day;8latvf;https://i.redd.it/cdbi6znpdfz01.jpg

"> I have a friend that is a huge movie buff. All he does is watch movies and talk about them. He even went to school to get into the movie industry. 

Besides the few cases what I originally said is true. If you said “no one wants to have sex with frogs,” I could go out and find the few cases where you’re wrong. In general video games are much more addictive.

>That being said, if you've got the money, and it's a hobby you enjoy, why does the money matter? Spending money on things you enjoy isn't inherently bad.

Could not agree more. If you are set in life then go for it. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, my problem is that a lot of people who are poor and play video games keep themselves in perpetual poverty with “hobbies” instead of saving that money. But yes if you’re rich and have an income where you don’t have to worry about that, go for it.

> Playing these types of games from a young age led me to my career path. 

And again, good for you, really. But how many people who play video games have the same story you do? MAYBE if we are being super generous .5%? 
 
There are a good 50%-60% of the males at my college who go straight from class to playing video games, or, sometimes if it’s a double XP weekend or a new DLC they skip class altogether. 
Source: I have been at college for 3 years and have had many roommates. I see the same 15% of the class missing classes over and over and hear what they talk about.

Now if you can tell me that skipping classes for video games is a good thing, then I don’t know what to think. It is such an unhealthy thing and I guarantee that the people with social anxiety would be a lot better off taking a walk, hitting the gym, or doing something else rather than sitting in their dorm all day playing fortnight. 

> There's a middle ground between casual and unhealthy.

Yes, and maybe I came I’m too strong about video games because like you said, it’s not black and white. If you occasionally play with your friends or you are making a career out of it, I have no issue. But I still believe that a majority of people would be much better off if they cut that addiction altogether.

"> And again, good for you, really. But how many people who play video games have the same story you do? MAYBE if we are being super generous .5%?

There is no way that only .5% of people who play video games in life end out successful. This is just flat out false. If it is true though, please link a reputable source. Games are on every cell phone these days, and I know plenty of successful people that played Angry Birds while I was in college.

> There are a good 50%-60% of the males at my college who go straight from class to playing video games, or, sometimes if it’s a double XP weekend or a new DLC they skip class altogether. Source: I have been at college for 3 years and have had many roommates. 

This part is very revealing. Again, you cannot generalize all gamers just because the ones you know play MMO's (specifically WOW). These are MMORPG's you're referring to. This is a VERY small subset of games. There is a very big difference an MMO and really any other type of game. MMO's have no real end to them and are designed to be addictive because of the monthly fees (to keep the player reeled in). I stay away from MMO's for these two reasons.

I also went to Uni and I know the crowd you're talking about (especially being in the Computer Science department). If a big new game comes out or a new expansion is released, they skipped class. I personally never did this, but I find that incredibly shitty and irresponsible. That being said, that is the person's fault and not the video game's. There are plenty of people that play MMO's/games that do know how to prioritize. Source: I work with them now. We even have a gaming room at the office.

> I see the same 15% of the class missing classes over and over and hear what they talk about.

This is a case of the vocal minority. Because it's an online game (specifically an MMO), you're hearing them talk about it because they're playing it together. I bet you in the same room that you're overhearing people talk about this MMO, there are a dozen others that are playing an offline game that don't require such a time dedication. You don't hear them talking about it because there's nothing to talk about (other than maybe a shared experience).

> Now if you can tell me that skipping classes for video games is a good thing, then I don’t know what to think. It is such an unhealthy thing and I guarantee that the people with social anxiety would be a lot better off taking a walk, hitting the gym, or doing something else rather than sitting in their dorm all day playing fortnight.

Agreed, sitting in your dorm all day doing any one thing is unhealthy.

> But I still believe that a majority of people would be much better off if they cut that addiction altogether.

Yes, if it is an addiction, cut it out immediately (or cut back anyway). Becoming a slave to anything is never good. It's like the difference of those who like to drink vs an alcoholic.

Personally, it sounds like you're just surrounded by shitty gamers/shitty people. We're not all like that, I promise. In fact, I'd wager the majority of us are not like that.

Final thoughts: Not all gamers are irresponsible, and not all games are MMO time sinks. Most addictions are not a good thing. Moderation is the key.";1;0;False;throwawayjw1914_2;dzy0p2y;We are just waiting for the good times now;8nbmdp;https://i.redd.it/6nvi3w7wr1111.jpg

"I can guess what erm3s was referencing when they spoke cryptically about (I could be wrong though): Milky Way, running away towards the infinite, spirals, and diamonds. Such are literary references that may influenced this design and/or at the least the design of the logo. I suspect with this kind of niche knowledge, or really useful coincidence, erm3s is someone we should lend our ear to when they comment as they may know somehow something we all have yet to find out.

I came across this after I decided to figure out if the ""B"" logo for BitCoin was tilted at a 10° angle or not, turns out it is by default either tilted to 12.5° or rounded off to 14° (as for this image I haven't checked, I will have to find an app that allows me to overlay those math tools to dicern the degree of angles), thus I was wrong about whatever ""10"" was suppose to be used for but in the meantime I found pretty cool historical art and literary stuff about it all.";-4;1;False;AmirisJBrown;dzxfmjc;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

Well, I'm trying a few different paths and two of those paths require what appears to be trigonometry -- I thought it was geomotry at first until researching more and it's actually trig.

"I think we have enough hints and people are following different paths and reporting on their efforts. I for one have not had my interest wane let alone vanish. I think most of us, even I at one time, were missing it completely -- as stated prior this is a ""treasure hunt"" and it should be approached like a ""marathon"" not a sprint. Thus, maybe we should treat it as such and not be blinded by the tendency to run Blockchain operations. Due to the obvious theme I was insistent upon running Blockchain operations at first glance, but now I realize there could be something else to this puzzle.";-3;0;False;AmirisJBrown;dzxwdvu;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Good luck to anyone that's trying to bruteforce this.


There's 116 BIP39 words in this image. If the seed has 24 non repeatable words, this will give you: 116!/(116-24)! combinations. That's just 2727927105132654282924644622427678734286848000000 combinations.


Even if you check 1 billion of them per day, it would take you 7473772890774395295683957869664873244 years.
