And damn, I generally love festivals and art. It's the idea of being stranded in the desert for a week with questionable art that doesn't seem very interesting.;1;1;False;BeerPowered;cjtgflu;This guy scammed a scammer! (x-post /r/justiceporn);2dlord;http://imgur.com/a/tR48B
"Well, burning man is not the kind of festival I like would be more accurate.

Personally for me the best fest this year and one of the best fests I've ever been was a small metal fest in Lithuania. It did cost something around $9 and had mostly unknown local bands playing. There were only several hundred people participating but it had that amazing friendly vibe. The thing with those mostly small metal fests is that metal isn't quite popular and metalheads are a very specific crowd, so all the people in there share common interests and that makes up for an amazingly friendly atmosphere. I've literally never seen a fight in a metal fest.

[If you're interested, here's a promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeSA7JfHQaE) in intentionally broken English since the only people from abroad in there are a couple of bands. As you can see they're not even trying to hide the fact that people are going there only to drink and hear live music somewhere in the background. That's my type of festival, and I have to say that it's completely different to burning man.";2;1;False;BeerPowered;cjtx3sv;This guy scammed a scammer!

Yeah. I mean, you *could* totally love it! It does sound like an experience. A lot of my friends go every year and always have a good time. I just think you could do the same thing for exponentially less money. ;1;1;False;booksforlunch;cjtsicy;This guy scammed a scammer! (x-post /r/justiceporn);2dlord;http://imgur.com/a/tR48B
