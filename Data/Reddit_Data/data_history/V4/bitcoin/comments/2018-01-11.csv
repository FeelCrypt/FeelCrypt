This is great that you're donating a lot of money, however, it seems like you're giving mainly to charities that are already well established. Have you considered donating to smaller charities where your money will actually help make a positive impact on the people that the charity serves?

Donate to things that will help the development and use of ...useful... cryptocurrencies around the world to bring the bankless out of poverty, and create new wealth. I.e. new DNS servers, blocks on top of existing coins to optimize functions of pretty much all services. Cut out the middle man, and corruption. Create new jobs.

I think that ohboy was trying to convey that there are millions of ptsd suffers who are not vets. It's like saying that because college students are known for alcohol abuse that only college students are alcoholics. To add, there are so many reasonable and tangible things that could be helpful to those who struggle with ptsd, like funding for research (such as is this thread attempts to do...thank you), legislation to make sure mental health gets the funding and health coverage it should (all the talk here about the limits of therapy alone is only taking into account those that can actually afford any kind of therapy as most insurance does not cover or if does, barely), getting life insurance (you can be denied for ptsd and depression now), more awareness and less stigma, programs to help those many who become homeless or addicted because ptsd is so insidious and prevents one from being able to function normally in society. There are just so many effectual points to touch on that go unnoticed. It cannot be overstated how those things right there could be so helpful.;2;0;False;you_say_tomatillo;dsia1lk;"🍍 $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA.

I have done mushrooms and other substances and they do provide benefits to a point. However the most important part of the MDMA     therapies is that they build trust and provide opportunities to work through lifelong trauma with psychotherapy as well. Fear is definitely a huge problem for me, but instead of just reducing that bit, I will need to dig deeper and finding some meaning or peace with what I have been through.

"Range may vary a lot depending on the user's knowledge/experience it can go from 60mg to a gram. The ""safe dosage"" would be 1,5 or 1.3 mg/kg.

In a clinical fashion I think it would be even lower (researches may point that under 100/80 mg is barely neurotoxic if not at all) and the other risk tied to the substance would be prevented: body hydration and heating, pure MDMA and the rarest risk of having some underlying heart problem would probably checked out beforehand.

That's to say, it'd probably be 99,99% safe.

This isn't a matter of point of view. It's a matter of fact vs fiction. The drug has been researched by actual doctors and scientists and has been found to be safe for use in clinical trials and with a lot of potential to help people. Yes if used incorrectly or off the street there can be negative effects but to pretend that they can't be avoided because of personal bias makes no sense. The drug has been proven that it can be used, at even rcreational doses, with no long term effects. We have decades of people who have responsibly used MDMA and who have been studies and have suffered no neurotoxicity. Your bases on how neurotoxicity it is is based off nothing but feelings. That's not how science works. The dose makes the poison.

"I'm not saying that depersonalization/derealization doesn't happen. It's happened to me in the past for 8 months but I never blamed the LSD for it. I'm actually grateful it happened because the things I saw which led to the difficult trip that caused the DPDR, revealed the traumas I haven't dealt with in my past and my addictions.

It's easier to blame a drug, than face whatever it is that caused it (including taking responsibility for the dosage and set & setting), and integrate the lessons into life.

"This is excellent news that new (well not really new) drugs are being tried for PTSD. Its not a good thing at all. 

Although I love this effort from the community, a 68% efficacy rate wont get FDA approval. Usually PH2 is make or break for a major drug. I don't know what they can really do to Increase this unless they get lucky picking a specific group that reacted more positive to the treatment (ex 18-25 yr old female post pregnancy, or male 30-40yr old ect...). FDA will be looking for this in their PH3 Results but it will be a long term study (at least 2 years, probably more for long term side effects noted). 

I hope all works out with this. I will track this in my biotech research. I would be glad to donate if their CEO came out with a proper road map for the public.

"Yes and No. 

(As usual the correct answer for most questions in our World today IMHO).

The takeaway for me is that everything we read and see needs to be taken on its merit. Anything can be posted online these days and is blindly believed across all spectrums. The prob is that there is a huge amount of misinformation out there (often widely believed without clear evidence to back it up).

It is the Uncle Joe types ( who we all love it must be said) that need to ask themselves questions most~ ironically.

If we have this belief that everything is a conspiracy~ nothing we see on TV or on the news is to be believed etc.  And (worse) we are signed up to websites (for example) which promote these kind of ideas (Big Pharma is coming to get ya etc) and believe each and every one of them then we just need to question deeply ourselves (as much as the info as presented from both sides) and ask why are we thinking like this exactly.

Fact checking sites (again which need to be looked at objectively too) have an important role here and they should be exhausted before any final decision is made as to what we believe  on a particular subject.

And finally apologies for the lack of f words in my piece which prob make my argument that bit less argumentative.

If buying things with a crypto currency is made illegal then as soon as you are discovered using your coins you can be in trouble.

"**Legality of bitcoin by country or territory**

The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Whilst the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently.

"I wouldn't say you are completely wrong. But I would argue that its pretty unlikely. Binance has 5 million users alone. I would say theres much, much more then 3 million people. Also, coinbase received 100million in funding a few months back. Those people funding do their due diligence. They aren't throwing money at something with the expectation that it will be disallowed in 6 months. They have looked into regulation and most likely rub elbows with congressman and senators so they are more in tune with that stuff then we are. There's also the idea of blockchain and innovation.  There's real use cases that can enhance society. Putting an end to that now would most likely not be in the best interest because other countries are not shutting it down. This is all a competition and if Japan or Russia are making strides technologically, you know other countries will want to follow and keep up.

10X is an exaggeration, but you are right that loans would be harder to get with sound money, but the prices of houses was also much less. There was also much less regulation so you could throw up something yourself really and a lot of people did that. ;1;0;False;cpgilliard78;dshyc81;"Jamie Dimon: ""I regret"" calling bitcoin a fraud";7p6jar;https://www.ft.com/content/e04e359a-e9e9-3f8e-8e2f-3f4373e5efb0
