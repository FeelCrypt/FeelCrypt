Hey, the game has adverts in it. But they make a tiny amount daily, so the app relies on donations. But they make next to nothing. So no not really. But that’s fine as it was just a side project for me!

"I agree that bitcoin solved real problems, but it is able to do so because the content it works with is exceeding simple. Without any fancy AI, it is able to determine if a transaction is trying to double spend, if it's spending more than the inputs, etc.

You surely can build a decentralized community, of that I have no doubt, but I absolutely doubt its resilience to bad actors. It's not as simple as a ledger of account balances, so the system can't autonomously police itself as bitcoin does.

> When some group gets to tell everyone else what they can and can't do, we automatically both miss the chance to use the resources that the repressed individuals have to offer

First, the group *isn't* telling *everyone else* what to do. The rules only apply to people who want to participate in the group. Don't like the rules? Find another group.

Second, this entire conversation started because people were spamming Monero sales pitches in here. If you have convinced yourself that these people are repressed or that they have anything to offer, you might be a bit confused.

Remember, this is /r/bitcoin. It's not /r/CryptoCurrency, and it it's not /r/monero. Altcoin discussions are *usually* off-topic, and when they're nothing more than people trying to pump up their investment, they're worse than that. They're spam. I'd expect to get the same treatment if I recommended people invest in some penny stock I'd purchased on this forum. Not only is it very bad etiquette, it's off topic.

"> I welcome you to prove me wrong

That's not what conversations are for.  Conversations are for sharing different information than you already have, so that you can better see the big picture of reality, from all sides, and grasp it more objectively than a single perspective allows you to do.

If you are curious about decentralized systems, I would suggest looking into ecosystems and systems theory and complexity/chaos theory, as well as just trying a social group where you have a shared goal (""We want to better understand X."" for example.) and don't put any centralized rules in place.  

It's the normal way that life interacts, so while it might seem weird to you on the surface, I think you'll find that it's actually what you normally do in most of your interactions with the universe already.";1;1;False;Turil;dxulrjs;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"You don't seem to acknowledge the existence of the immune or central nervous systems in that exceedingly bad analogy of yours. Maybe think of a better one next time.

You have a right to free speech, but you don't have a right to a free venue. This is a privately run website, so there are rules. In my house, I kick you out if you insult the other guests. Same story here. Deal with it.

Now I've repeatedly asked for links to this decentralized community that you keep discussing as if it exists in reality. Why haven't you provided any? Your ideas are nice in theory, but until a working example exists - at scale (millions of users) - then it only exists on paper. Bitcoin only truly ""worked"" in my mind until recently, after demonstrating many times that it can survive in the face of all sorts of BS being thrown at it. A decentralized community is something I would take part in, but I'd remain skeptical until the community grew large and was subject to the same sort of hate and attempted attacks that any other community would be subject to.

I'm not saying your ideas are bad. I'm just saying that I'm *skeptical* they'll work, though I welcome you to prove me wrong. You can't do that through some wishy-washy analogy or thought experiment. Make the community, or at least find it. In the meantime, we either accept the rules of the communities that DO exist, or we don't say anything at all. Them's the rules.";1;1;False;CaptainOuzo;dxu2rzm;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"> I absolutely doubt its resilience to bad actors

That's because you have been sold the myth that the only way to keep you ""in line"" is for someone else to tell you what you can and can't do.  You have been raised to think that authoritarian systems are the only option you have.

>First, the group isn't telling everyone else what to do. The rules only apply to people who want to participate in the group.

That IS the group.  Everyone who wants to participate in the group in a decentralized system is welcome, and each is equally free to make up their own approach, with ""the rules"" emerging naturally from that, bottom-up.  As in the way your body works with all the different DNA and expressions of that DNA in each cell, all eventually forming you, and everything that is you.  There is no central control cell or voting, it's just everyone doing what they want to do, with a shared goal (of keeping the system healthy).

And instead of ""keeping out bad actors"" it tends to use all of the individuals that show up in the system as resources, because most cells are good at doing something. And the cells that don't have the shared goal that everyone else has end up not making any friends and not being used (generally being allowed to simply flow back out of the system as a waste product, not in any aggressive way, but naturally).

>That kind of content not only should be removed, but must be removed, for this community to be healthy.

In a decentralized, free system, where everyone is equal, the content that you aren't interested in can be blocked BY YOU, if you want, while others, who might enjoy the content, can still see it.  No centralized, authoritarian discrimination possible, or needed.  You don't get to tell others what they can see, or share.  And they can't tell you what you are allowed to see and share.  That is an actual healthy system.

What we have here, now, is like the mainstream banking system, where some dudes (I bet it is all males...) are forcing everyone else who wants to participate in the game to obey or be banished.  If you like that kind of authoritarian rule on you, that's fine, you can be a submissive type.  Even in a decentralized system you can as someone else to curate your life.  But the rest of us would prefer to think for ourselves, and be free from bias and discrimination.";1;1;False;Turil;dxtvd0p;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
