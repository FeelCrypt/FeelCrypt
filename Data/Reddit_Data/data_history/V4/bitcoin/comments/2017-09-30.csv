How is bitcoin not a fiat currency? And why would the value of Bitcoin go down? Wouldn't it continue to go up because of how deflationary it is?;2;1;False;TheMy5teryMan;dnps264;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

People will want to use bitcoin first as a store of value as prices go up, and then as a form of payment as price stabilizes. Some people recognize that as the USD continues to inflate, the USD will become worth less and less. All fiat currency eventually returns to its original value, which is 0. As fiat currencies become worth less and less, some individuals see that bitcoin is not inflating and thus may decide to park some of their funds in bitcoin. Bitcoin is useful because it is like cash for the internet. Unlike traditional systems that need a bank as a middle man, bitcoin utilizes no middle man, which means a bitcoin wallet cannot be frozen and the funds can never be stopped from being sent. Whereas with banks funds can be frozen and stopped. Bitcoin is also universal since there is no centralized government attached to it. Meaning one bitcoin can be spent and accepted in Japan as easy as it could be in the USA. Someone with a smartphone in India can just as easily set up a bitcoin wallet just as easily as they could in Europe. Setting up a bitcoin wallet requires no one's permission unlike the traditional banking system. ;1;1;False;Jushe;dnprtoy;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/
How would it become slower? Either Bitcoin doesn't become a thing or it does but the price continues to rise due to new people coming into it. It IS a fiat currency because whether or not something is a fiat currency is not dependent on if it is backed by a government or continually printed, but rather whether the thing itself holds any actual value. For example, salt is not a fiat currency because it has actual value. Cash is because it only has value because everyone says it has value. Bitcoin is just electronic cash, except it is incredibly deflationary.;2;0;False;TheMy5teryMan;dnq1l1c;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/
Bitcoin is not a fiat currency because it is not backed by any central government and the amount of bitcoins in circulation will not continue to go up. Eventually the rate at which bitcoin deflates will become slower and slower thus providing stability. ;1;1;False;Jushe;dnpyi9i;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"The mempool has been pretty empty, or totally empty, the last week or two. I've sent transactions for a few cents worth of btc. 

But yeah; how long will it last?

But nah; it comes and goes and comes around again.

um..no.. because there is no excess supply - bitcoin limits coins to 21million total.  But that's enough for us to use AND to not lose value simultaneously.;1;0;False;jregen;dnpwpkn;Governments/Banks vs Bitcoin.;7000xh;https://i.redd.it/1ui0rr23hplz.jpg
