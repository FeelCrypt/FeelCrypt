"There was an old overlay network (mesh-ish) that did address assignment but it used a central authority to assign IPv6 addresses (there was not a good way to do distributed network assignment back then). It was pretty decent for its time, I wish I could remember the name...        
       
I have been excited about ad-hoc/mesh networking for different levels of the internet for a long time, I think it is important but I find the religious exuberance a bit over the top, but this is /r/bitcoin so I should take it with a grain of salt. My interest before 2000 was related to situations related to natural disasters. Of course, in the past few years the urgency has shifted to political/man-made disasters.

"""They can't stop it"" is as likely as ""they can't break this copy protection"". 

For example, if you are doing bitcoin-mediated access to services, all it takes is someone with enough money to buy out your local capacity. Like, say, the Chinese goverment.

Now, I'm sure there are problems with  my idea, and there will be problems with those problems.

It's an arms race, and if you think ""this time we are ending the race"", you are showing a lack of historical perspective.

Most certainly, it would not solve the generalized example of a chat system better than the ""servers in Mountain View"" system.

"> cjdns is not magic

Obviously.

> won't solve huge classes of problems related to internetworking

Is assignment of address space a 'huge class' of problem?  Even if you don't think that routing (and, for that matter, switching) in this distributed fashion is a game-changer, can we agree that address assignment needs to be done differently?  CJDNS and similar projects have a promising approach and it's not unfair to suggest that they might just solve this class of problem.

> A connected graph is not a ""bus"" just because it is not a full equal node-weight mesh.

Fine.  However, ""connected graph"" isn't well-defined network terminology, although I agree that it better describes the transport layer of the internet.  However, the physical layer does look an awful lot like a bus - almost everyone is connected to a long, strung-out corporate-owned connection and cannot do packet switching with their neighbors absent the router at their ISP.

> You can't run the current internet on a mesh without creating some backbone-a-like system.

Agreed.  I'm not interested in running the ""current internet"" anyway, but even in my vision, I totally agree that long fiber cables, satellite connections, and yes, even ""backbones"" are part of a strong internet.

We can, however, distribute the responsibilities of routing, switching, and address space throughout our communities and ensure that, for example, urban areas with great density of connections have low-latency, high-bandwidth, energy efficient connections within them.";1;1;False;jMyles;ckyu6aw;Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down.
