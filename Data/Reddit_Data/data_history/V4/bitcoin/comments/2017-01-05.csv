"Because it's not just about buying and selling, it's how many people buying vs how many are selling. An extremely simplified version: Fewer buyers than sellers = price tends to decrease (like now, a bunch of people sell at $1000, and as the price drops, more people are *inclined* to sell while fewer buy). So just because someone is selling something doesn't mean there will always be a buyer for it. Think of it like ill-fitting jeans at a store. Not many are going to buy it at full price, so they reduce the price until they start selling.

Several months ago, more people were willing to buy Bitcoin and less willing to sell, and the price increases. This price increase contributes to more buyers and fewer sellers, until equilibrium happens or a lot of people suddenly sell (like now).
