"XRP isn’t any cheaper. The banks aren’t going to use it. This is starting to leak out. That means it has no use case whatsoever.

ETH doesn’t have any use case either, and has a personality as it’s centralization. Avoid.";1;0;False;xtal_00;et4kdbq;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg

so true, I was getting dirty looks from everyone when I was buying BTC at 3.5k and now they climbing over themselves to buy and asking me if it will come back down again to buy. LMAO, rinse and repeat.;1;0;False;wesdacar;et5qla2;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg
Best advice is your own advice.  While I was buying from 3000-3500.  My friends were waiting for it to go to 1000 range.  Based on FA on Youtube.;2;1;False;regionrat03;et6d6yl;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg

That's rough man. I held all my altcoins and btc and seriously wasnt tripping at all during the bear market. And then I bought as much as I could while it was at 3300 so I can safely say I'm pretty happy with my buying decisions. Not to brag or anything haha;2;0;False;Bl33zy530;et5iguh;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg
"that guy makes sense. no body is touching xrp with a bean pole, except average bagholders. 

eth is creating distributed computing machine, when I can just run programs on amazon servers. no body needs it. it has no use.";1;0;False;parakite;et4mdt5;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg
