Oh, you' ll have to because commodities that trade in markets are not standards of value. For that to be possible it would have to be brought in house by government to function as a way to meet the obligations that it enforces. While this is possible, it represents a nightmare scenario for the Bitcoin crowd who think all this must be decentralized. Having a standard of value is an act of centralization.  Without one you are at the mercy of markets and market behavior. ;1;2;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1eedg3;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

The price of goods is defined in a market like Bitcoin. That market may be outside a country, in which case a currency has no use outside of its borders. If you think a county's currency is that undesirable why are you trading good money for bad? Not all county's obligations are as well enforced as others. If you distrust a country's citizenship pledge then do not live there. Where the obligations are strong and well maintained the money is very stable and the prices of things still fluctuate in the market because not everything that a person could want originates within a country. Markets are what punish people while governments are what try and give stability.Bitcoin markets punish people too while governments continue to enforce obligation that gives money great stability.;2;2;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1ehnjm;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

"Look, I dipped my feet in currency trading since 2009...and here's my main point...

Prices are dictated by supply and demand... u can try to ""dictate"" the price, but don't expect that to hold... sooner or later, everyone follows that law...

Also, I can't wrap my head around what ur trying to dictate. The exchange rate or the price of a certain goods?

Your thinking of labor. I am not. Your obligation pays for the work of having money as liability and asset, and the level of affluence it allows you. The societal cost of money is obligation. The sum of all that money allows is paid back by everyone in obligation. What you agree to work for is another thing that trades in a market, a market for labor. Some have spoken about wanting to standardize the value of labor, but that is not what is meant by me.;1;2;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1ei2qd;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg
You're not making any sense here, I think you are grasping at straws.  An obligation can certainly be paid in BTC, as people buy things with BTC.  If your only argument is that TAXES, a.k.a govt obligations are paid in dollars, therefore, it is standardized, umm ok, then you just have a false illusion of govts and societies in general.  And either way, it doesn't support your original assertion that standardization requires centralization.;5;2;False;FrogTrainer;e1eikrq;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg
"Not a dollar equals a dollar. A dollar of obligation equals a dollar. A certain amount of ""economic work"" equals a dollar. That's what you sign up for as a citizen. The price of your obligation is that you must work to have money. Part of another obligation is that you must return it to where it came for the liability part to be canceled out.

You traded a standard of value inside a country for another standard of value in an other country. The value of each within their jurisdiction did not change. They still meet the same amount of obligation as before where they are doing what they are intended to do. When you do currency trading you are not meeting government obligations, You are in fact trading a means to settle a foreign obligation as a commodity asset in a third party market where you are at the mercy of bid and ask. You can trade any country's standard of value as a commodity if you want. This trading does not influence the fact that one dollar of my obligation is still met by one dollar. It does not force me to pay more or less tax. You, on the other hand, can get ahead by doing some trading (or not get ahead). ;3;1;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1egmv8;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

A standard of anything is something that is collectively held and maintained (assured). A standard of weight or of volume is something that we collectively uphold and keep well defined. The standard of wealth in a country and for its citizens is the agreed upon obligation to the government. One dollar meets one dollar of obligation to the government. We can trade in that shared collective obligation because it is enforced by the law to make it very stable. If you fail to meet you obligation (i.e. taxes) that much value is taken from you. There is no defining obligation to define a value to Bitcoin. No one is obliged to its creators and no assets of value are taken from you to preserve the value of it to keep it steady in value. It simply trades in markets where it is valued in the units of the standard of value. Bitcoin is a market based commodity that is bartered in third party transactions also. It never comes close to becoming a standard of value. ;1;1;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1efxx4;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg
