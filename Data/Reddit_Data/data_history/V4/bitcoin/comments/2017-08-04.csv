That's right. We can imagine a war between a community B1 and a community B2. At some point, a part of community B1 is heated so much they decided to form a sub-community (B1sub) and begin an actual fight (after specific day in the future). A lot of members of parent community don't want the conflict, though they can't do anything about it. They can stand still and watch how that fight will turn, but if B1sub will lose, the whole B1 will lose. That said, it's always better to do the best to prevent the conflict, but if the battle began, it's better to cooperate as a whole. Unfortunately, that was not the case in BIP148. Hopefully, we will win. Though, the battle is not over, there is a possibility of huge manipulation from the B2 until the end of the year.;1;0;False;;dl65mh3;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png

The minor chain currently has too few miners compared to the difficulty, hence the block frequency is fairly low.  This was expected and predicted, and will probably sort itself out in due time.

"I think the problem is that terms like ""socialist"" often encompass a range of beliefs that are often correlated but not necessarily interdependent. 

I definitely don't agree with all things that are espoused by all people who call themselves socialists. I do however agree with the core tenet that individual prosperity is best achieved through ensuring prosperity of the masses even at the temporary or minor expense of the individual. 

For example, I would rather pay somewhat higher taxes and (collectively) force my neighbour to do so as well with the purpose of those taxes being used for the betterment of society than rely on individual good will or free markets to solve problems like infrastructure and crime. I also believe parents don't 'own' their children and should not be able to opt out of vaccinations (medical exemptions are of course okay) or indoctrinate their children with extreme dangerous beliefs. 

However I also firmly believe in the value of personal freedom where society is either minimally affected or unaffected. I am pro drug legalisation and against most ""big brother"" initiatives. 

I also believe that all powers granted to governments must be controlled as much as possible to reduce abuse. It should never be easy for the government to define any belief freely as being ""extreme and dangerous"" and therefore banned. It's a difficult and complex knife edge to balance on, but one that I believe is worth it. 

Where Bitcoin comes in is as one of these controls. I want the government to tax you (and me), but I want us all to have control over our money so that they are not free to take it at will. Should they abuse their power to tax us, we must have the power to say no.

"Socialism didn't kill anyone. People that followed political parties that had some socialist ideas did. 

Technically the nazis were socialist. It's right there in the name *National Sozialisten*. But there's definitely not a lot I would agree with them on. 

Just the first paragraph of the definition on Wikipedia (highlights mine):

**Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production**, as well as the political theories, and movements associated with them. Social ownership may refer to forms of public, collective, or cooperative ownership, or to citizen ownership of equity. **There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. Social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.**

As a believer in the idea that social ownership and democratic control of the means of production is the best way to achieve a prosperous and successful society with the highest level of general happiness for all, what should I call myself if not socialist?

> Are both subs manipulated by shills of opposing powers operating from the shadows?


Kinda? Both subs definitely show bias. /r/btc is literally bought and paid for (and I mean that literally as in literally, not figuratively. It was a factual purchase) by Roger Ver. He's constantly posting information that goes in the direction he wants, while banning and deleting posts they don't like (but not to the extent /r/bitcoin bans and deletes). /r/bitcoin is influenced (not bought, but influenced through cooperation between the mods here and the core devs + Blockstream) in a way that's pro Core, pro Blockstream. They are much less likely to influence the actual discussions here in the way Roger Ver does, BUT they are more likely to delete posts here.


It's kinda like, /r/btc grows the discussions to their agenda, while /r/bitcoin prunes the discussion to their agenda.


Personally, as an outsider, I prefer pruning over growing. People call it ""censorship"", but I see it as keeping your property to your liking. Your establishment can throw out whoever they don't like. This can be fact checked, we can discover which posts are deleted (it's like throwing them out but keeping a log of what they said and when/why they were thrown out). The other way is more of a ""the media controls our thoughts"" way, where the authority is leading the discussions, indirectly brainwashing it. I don't like this, because that's what leads to sheeple who are spoonfed the specific information the authority figures want.


That being said, I only prefer one over the other assuming it's equally bad. The first way (how /r/bitcoin does it) can be abused if the reasons people are getting kicked out does not make sense (kicking someone out for harassing individuals in your establishment makes sense. Kicking them out for trying to market a competitors product while inside your establishment makes sense. Kicking them out because they had visited a rivaling establishment in the past or mentions the other establishment, however, is overstepping boundaries). In that same vein, authorities influencing opinions through discussions like /r/btc does it doesn't have to be malicious. But if done too much, that's how you get the style of brainwashing that religions have to deal with, blind faith in their authority. (and obviously, to some extent, both subs do kinda do both, just each sub leans more one way).

> Or is this just the usual par for the course when an open source project can't reach consensus and the differing views fork from each other (plus added bitterness because money is involved)?


Little of column A and little of column B. As I said above, I'm not really a member of either community. I'm a lot more neutral when it comes to Blockstream vs AntMiner (?I don't think it was AntMiner but that's what comes to mind rn) or Core vs Ver. However, I fall under that second category of ""differing views"" and ""bitterness because money"".


I wanted Segwit over not having it. That being said, I wanted it for $ reasons. I feel that it would increase the price of BTC (which would increase it of all alts) by setting a precident for actually moving forward with new tech and not relying on Sathoshi's whitepaper for every decision. It also meant Litecoin and other alts would be able to atomic swap with Bitcoin, which is good for those alts considering I'm invested in a lot of them. So for me, the decision is greed based and differing views. 


That being said, I don't believe differing views alone is enough to cause the level of hate the two subs have. I do think that the authorities are stirring the pot more than people like to admit (I mean, I was over in /r/btc and literally saw Luke-Jr arguing again, say the increased block size is the end of the world, and then talk about Christianity being the factual/logical choice rather than emotional/spiritual choice, which is something they insult him over viewing and he just fuels the hate by arguing back instead of letting it die. Roger Ver stirs the pot over there getting them riled up, but authorities here go there and do the same)";9;1;False;SunliMin;dl69t30;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png
