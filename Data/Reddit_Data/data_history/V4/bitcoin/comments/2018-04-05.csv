"You're blaming Reagan for the homeless problem? lol  BTW, you didn't show that housing them is cheaper just because you linked some studies, because any organization can cherry pick stats and guide their conclusion.  I bet your next liberal thesis will be that our current welfare system is also cheaper, and fiscally and morally successful, after all, RAND has helped shaped that policy as well in the 60s.  Progress? 

The Personal Responsibility argument has historical proof, even YOU are a product of it.  It's called survival and it exists in third world to first world countries.  I support helping the incapable homeless, but they are not the majority that are capable and are in their predicament because of self-inflicted abuses and poor life choices.  There's usually a story behind every capable homeless person and why they've been abandoned by society, their former employers, and even their own family members.  I'm sure they were given ample opportunities and chances to change their behavior, but did not.  There are also so many examples of people born into poverty that took advantage of public schooling and live a respectable life and contribute to society.  They had initiative, pride, and grit... a human resource that is in abundance if you have the motivation to look for it.

You're being an enabler to a social problem and your solution has long-term negative effects, but hey, let's blame Reagan.";1;1;False;Red_Over_Green;dwtn89s;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg

"So, having been shown that housing them is cheaper - you decide money doesn't matter and take a pseudo-moral position?  Do you want to save money or not?

Apart from that, your argument is bullshit.  People can already get a tent and live under a bridge if they are inclined that way.  So why don't they?  ""Why work when you can just panhandle and get high by the river?""  That's where your argument leads.  But most people don't take that path.

Most people are not happy with crumbs.  Nobody who can work just decides to give it up because they're not gonna starve.  Most people want more.  This has been shown in the [basic income experiments](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/01/one-year-on-finland-universal-basic-income-experiment.html).  Despite having basic income, the recipients still pursued vocations.

It also glosses over the reality of the people who are homeless.  A lot of them are simply not equipped to work. They aren't wired to.  Many of them are mentally ill (and were put on the street by Reagan) and should be institutionalized.  That we don't take care of them as a society is barbaric and shameful.  The ""personal responsibility"" argument is crap.

There are definitely *certain* individuals out there (not saying you, or 100% of a group) who behave as though, and will not have a problem telling the world, that they HATE homeless. And THAT is a crazy ass generalization, because even I hate certain homeless in my own demographic, but those of us ""good eggs"" that see broken things and fix them, protect others from being victimized whenever possible, and just being overall considerate people despite the unmitigated hell we live day in and day out.

"At first glance is seems that the government is an insurmountable foe, and the odds are overwhelmingly against a revolutionary force. Tanks, missiles, chemical weapons, bombs, nukes and all that.

This is just ignorance.

Modern warfare (termed Fourth Generation warfare) is characterized by low intensity guerrilla conflict with a focus on insurgency coupled with strategic strikes against high value targets and control of public media (hearts and minds).

Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the realities of a modern US revolution.

Best estimates put the sum of our armed forces at about 2.1 million people. That's everybody from the high speed low drag operators down to the janitors and cooks. Reserves included.

Federal and State law enforcement totals about 800,000 sworn LEOs. We'll be generous and say a combined total of 3 million give or take 100,000 (remember some of those people are cross over and are counted in both categories).

So assuming that every single one of them would side with the government (which is a laughable assumption in the first place) that is a fighting force of about 3 million.

In 2012 Wisconsin issues over 600,000 hunting permits. Now some of those will cross with the ""government"" side, but let's just say half are neither LEO or military. That's 300,000 people who have experience in precision shooting, stalking, tracking, and use of camouflage. From one state.

It's estimated that there are about 100 million gun owners in the US (I'd say the number is actually much higher, but we'll use that as the number of non LEO/military gun owners as it makes things simple for the purposes of this discussion.

During the American Revolution (the one against England) it is well accepted that approximately 55% of people supported the revolutionaries, while ~25% provided material support in some way (food, shelter), about 10% provided supplies (weapons, etc.) and intel, and about 3% of the colonists did the actual fighting.

If we can assume those numbers would be consistent today, the revolutionaries could field a fighting force of about 3 million people. So just at basic clean black and white assumptions we have an equal number of combatants.

Now anyone that actually knows people in the military and law enforcement knows that not all of them are going to side with the government in a situation like this. In my opinion, if ordered to take up arms against their own people, better than half of them will refuse or desert. Many of them taking their equipment, training, and experience directly to the revolutionaries, including tanks, APCs, machine guns, rockets, and so on.

Now we come to missiles, bombs, bio/chem/nukes.

No one is going to use them. First, any commander ordering their use on American soil is more likely to be shot by their own men than to have that order carried out. That's just the facts. But for arguments sake let's say that someone was able to order a strike with a WMD on the revolutionary forces.

Can you imagine how that would swell the ranks of the other side? Pretty much anyone on the fence at all (and probably a large portion of their supporters) would instantly align with the revolutionaries.

So WMDs are pretty much right off the table.

We're left with about even man to man odds in these assumptions and all of the assumption have erred in favor of the government here.

That's 3 million revolutionaries hiding in a population of 300 million, no uniforms, a disjointed command infrastructure with cells operating independently and any given person apt to take independent yet copacetic action with the revolution at any time.

Against a force that almost exclusively wears uniforms and operates on rules of engagement that preclude mass bystander casualties (because it'll be a PR war as much as anything).

Oh, and that tricky Fourth Generation warfare thing.

It doesn't need to be a decided victory by man to man body count.

You could change the face of the country overnight by killing or capturing just 111 people.

100 senators

9 Supreme Court justices

1 Vice President

1 President

3 million against 111. It's bad odds. Pretty much an unwinnable nightmare scenario.

That aside it won't go down overnight. Armed conflict in this country? At least six months of hell on earth. Can you imagine what this country would look like after a couple of months of cops refusing to respond to any calls? That's exactly what will happen once a few dozen or hundred of them get wiped out in fake 911 call ambushes.

It'll be chaos. Gangs won't be sitting still, somebody is gonna figure out that say ""Warlord of Detroit"" is a hell of a title upgrade from Gang Leader. Not to mention the Mexican drug cartels (who are here and operating throughout this entire country. Do not let the media blackout on it fool you for a second).

You think your average person who decides to sit the main fight out is gonna just sit there while it happens? What do you think day to day life is gonna look like in this country for your average person?

Revolution would pretty much turn this country into a third world shithole overnight.

Now I'm just one guy. Who has put just a tiny bit of thought into how it might actually go down.

I'm just sayin, it's scary how easily it could happen.

The only question is what would be a big enough spark to ignite that uncontrollable blaze?

"> Deflation is not a consequence of a growing economy.

As long as technology keeps advancing, then we are able to produce more units of (most) commodities per person hour of labor.

So if you measure prices in average person hours of labor over time, you would expect the price of most commodities to fall.

Because central banks have been engineering inflation for over a hundred years, the average person has not been able to experience this natural deflation in their currency.  So the only examples we can point to of deflationary periods were when the banking system had lost its grip and the economy had been massively disrupted (a widespread collapse in demand).

So assuming that every single one of them would side with the government (which is a laughable assumption in the first place) that is a fighting force of about 3 million.

In 2012 Wisconsin issues over 600,000 hunting permits. Now some of those will cross with the ""government"" side, but let's just say half are neither LEO or military. That's 300,000 people who have experience in precision shooting, stalking, tracking, and use of camouflage. From one state.

It's estimated that there are about 100 million gun owners in the US (I'd say the number is actually much higher, but we'll use that as the number of non LEO/military gun owners as it makes things simple for the purposes of this discussion.

During the American Revolution (the one against England) it is well accepted that approximately 55% of people supported the revolutionaries, while ~25% provided material support in some way (food, shelter), about 10% provided supplies (weapons, etc.) and intel, and about 3% of the colonists did the actual fighting.

If we can assume those numbers would be consistent today, the revolutionaries could field a fighting force of about 3 million people. So just at basic clean black and white assumptions we have an equal number of combatants.

Now anyone that actually knows people in the military and law enforcement knows that not all of them are going to side with the government in a situation like this. In my opinion, if ordered to take up arms against their own people, better than half of them will refuse or desert. Many of them taking their equipment, training, and experience directly to the revolutionaries, including tanks, APCs, machine guns, rockets, and so on.

Now we come to missiles, bombs, bio/chem/nukes.

No one is going to use them. First, any commander ordering their use on American soil is more likely to be shot by their own men than to have that order carried out. That's just the facts. But for arguments sake let's say that someone was able to order a strike with a WMD on the revolutionary forces.

Can you imagine how that would swell the ranks of the other side? Pretty much anyone on the fence at all (and probably a large portion of their supporters) would instantly align with the revolutionaries.

So WMDs are pretty much right off the table.

We're left with about even man to man odds in these assumptions and all of the assumption have erred in favor of the government here.

That's 3 million revolutionaries hiding in a population of 300 million, no uniforms, a disjointed command infrastructure with cells operating independently and any given person apt to take independent yet copacetic action with the revolution at any time.

Against a force that almost exclusively wears uniforms and operates on rules of engagement that preclude mass bystander casualties (because it'll be a PR war as much as anything).

Oh, and that tricky Fourth Generation warfare thing.

It doesn't need to be a decided victory by man to man body count.

You could change the face of the country overnight by killing or capturing just 111 people.

100 senators

9 Supreme Court justices

1 Vice President

1 President

3 million against 111. It's bad odds. Pretty much an unwinnable nightmare scenario.

That aside it won't go down overnight. Armed conflict in this country? At least six months of hell on earth. Can you imagine what this country would look like after a couple of months of cops refusing to respond to any calls? That's exactly what will happen once a few dozen or hundred of them get wiped out in fake 911 call ambushes.

It'll be chaos. Gangs won't be sitting still, somebody is gonna figure out that say ""Warlord of Detroit"" is a hell of a title upgrade from Gang Leader. Not to mention the Mexican drug cartels (who are here and operating throughout this entire country. Do not let the media blackout on it fool you for a second).

You think your average person who decides to sit the main fight out is gonna just sit there while it happens? What do you think day to day life is gonna look like in this country for your average person?

Revolution would pretty much turn this country into a third world shithole overnight.

Now I'm just one guy. Who has put just a tiny bit of thought into how it might actually go down.

I'm just sayin, it's scary how easily it could happen.

"When did I say anything about “pulling oneself up by ones bootstraps”?  It seems like you would rather play ersatz Rex Tugwell New Deal tough guy and joust against a libertarian straw man than listen.

The fact is that Henry Wallace was a Stalinist right up until 1952, which puts him ahead of Kruschev by a year in rejecting the genocides, purges, and political murders.

Another example of New Deal economic lunacy was the law that prevented bank holding companies from owning banks across state lines, or from selling notes across state lines.  This resulted in banks being tied closely to the economic conditions in particular communities.  If a large factory closed, bank failures were likely to follow.  Something similar happened in the S&L crisis in the late 80s, after oil prices collapsed.

Compare this with the relatively deregulated environment during/after the so-called financial crisis in 2008-9.  Meredith Whitney predicted hundreds of community bank failures in 2011-2013, but this never happened.  In the less authoritarian regulatory environment, these banks had diversified, both geographically and in the types of collateral held.  Most were run well, since the leadership at these banks knew that they couldn’t count on financial “crisis”-style bailouts from their political allies.";1;1;False;oblomov1;dwv4f6o;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"In the past, it wasn't our duty to get involved in every European conflict. We were isolationists. Our policy in the past was to let the world deal with their problems. That approach led to Germany trying to conquer Europe twice in 30 years. If you didn't want soviet aggression, then you shouldn't have tried to invade them. If it wasn't for all those US military bases in Germany and Europe, I doubt the Soviet Union would've just given up control of its satellite states. It could also be debated on whether or not they'd have capitulated if it wasn't for the US. For you to go back to your values as a country, while at the same time letting the US protect you, has certainly been beneficial for Germany.

Since the US has been running the show, this world has experienced a global economic boom and unparalleled peace. Global shipment of oil has been uninterrupted that entire time, allowing our economies to grow unhindered. It's not a coincidence that we're living in such prosperous times. 

I guess at the end of the day, you and I are both different...and that's okay. I appreciate Germany for a lot of reasons. I even lived in Berlin for awhile. But for me, freedom is definitely something I feel. It's not something I can measure on a chart, or compare to someone else's freedom on a list.

"I really don’t want to come across the wrong way or take things to a personal level, but you’re categorically incorrect. Deflation is not a consequence of a growing economy. It’s typically a consequence of either over-production or currency mismanagement. 

Again, if you’ll look at the history I referenced above you’ll see that deflation via currency de-circulation was catastrophic to the American people. This is the entire basis for the Wizard of Oz children’s tale. In the book, Dorothy’s slippers are made of silver. The great and promising technicolor world that was promised by bankers if we adopted the gold standard (yellow brick road) was a farce. 

This decimated our economy, reduced the circulation of currency by 80% and completely placed power and money control in the hands of the wealthy few. Now there’s a lot to discuss regarding the reason why deflation has a negative effect on an economy, but there is a direct correlation between commodity based currencies and deflation. 

This is something that was a primary cause of the American Revolution according to Franklin and it is theorized that JC’s minting of gold coins and bringing gold into circulation was the primary reason for the downfall of Rome.

"FDR’s economic policy was ridiculous, and it lengthened the Depression.  

His idea was that “prices are too low”, the problem not being the collapse in demand.  Thus, under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) the Fedgov destroyed millions of bushels of grain to constrain supply and raise prices!  In 1933 alone, cotton farmers were paid $100M to plow their cotton plants back into the ground.  The federal govt bought 6M hogs from farmers in the same year, and destroyed them.  The AAA was led by Henry Wallace, who was impressed with Soviet farm collectivization, and wanted to bring Stalin’s magic touch to the US.

Similarly, there were wage and price controls under the National Recovery Act.  Business owners were imprisoned for paying their workers “too much”.

Fortunately, the US Supreme Court struck down the AAA and NRA as unconstitutional.  But the anti-gold lunacy was conceived by the same authoritarians, and it continued until 1975.

- The way I interpret the comment, the confiscation of bitcoin and/or gold by the government is justified and citizens should trade stores-of-value for fiat currency when the government demands so, to 'save' the economy. 


- In doing so, the comment presumes that persisting the gold standard, and attempting to manipulate the money supply through it, is beneficial for the economy, but, many economists argue that the gold standard exacerbated monetary contraction and deflation during the great depression


- Moreover, the government itself played a major role in worsening the great depression (i.e. Smoot Hawtley 1932) and the comment gives too much credit to the government's decision making capability during that time.

If you buy a $1 coin and in the future can only buy $0.10 amount of goods, it is no longer a $1 coin.   I personally experienced this by buying gold in the 80's and then watched as it went down to 1/4th of what I paid for it over the next 20 years.   

It's no different than a paper dollar not being able to buy as much.   You still have that physical $1 paper bill but it can't buy as much as it did 20 years ago.

>Have I explained my point of view?

You specifically mentioned gold holding it's value long ago when it didn't.   It is more stable today but could still drop to 1/6th of it's current value as it did from it's peak in 1980 to it's low in 2000.   

In the very long term, gold is likely to go down in value because it is believed that global population will stabilize and then decrease once all third world countries have increased their standard of living like in Japan and Europe.

We actually do have a clearly unjust law on the books that allows the government to essentially bypass the constitution by charging your property with crime instead of charging the owner, called [Civil Asset Forfeiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States). The practice has been especially abused in the last decade and we are now seeing progress in specific states enacting legislation that protects against this corrupt practice.

Other than that, I cannot think of any other examples that comes to mind that meets your scenario, so our property rights are pretty well preserved minus the civil asset forfeiture bit.

It did drop in value even factoring inflation and therefore it can again.   Absolutely everything you claim are the same claims people made in the 1970's about gold.  It all sounds rational which is why I bought gold in the early 1980's.  Then it went down year after year for 20 years.  It lost value greater than the inflation rate.  For example if you bought gold at the start of 1980 for $600, it was only worth $400 in 1981 despite inflation only being 13.5%.

If you buy 1oz gold today for $1300 and in 20 years can only sell it for $1000, it has lost real value.   (And that 1oz would buy even less than $1000 worth of goods in 2038 because of inflation.)

That is a false statement.   Value is relative and markets can stay irrational longer than you stay solvent.   The gold's value is determined when you need to exchange it.   If you need to exchange it during a low value timeframe, it's value has decreased- not stayed the same.

No. You're blatantly wrong. Gold cannot just drop to previous lows. To believe this is to fundamentally misunderstand inflation and is to fundamentally misunderstanding that money is merely a measurement. There are trillions in new USD since the 80s. When USD is created, there IS UNIVERSAL price increase. Commodities, like gold, silver, oil, and Uranium are priced in this expanding measurement of USD. The USD expands and so the price of commodities rises. And the only way the prices will permanently retrace is if the currency supply, itself, shrinks.

"To answer your question, I think the Federal Reserve was largely responsible for the bubbles (stock market, real estate) that preceded the Depression, as well as for the collapse.  There were many other factors that contributed, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, but the Fed inflated the bubble to begin with.

What would have been better?

Letting prices fall.  Let’s consider the previous economic downturn:  there was a sharp deflationary recession in 1920-21, following the end of WWI. 

From May 1920 to July 1921, automobile production declined by 60%, and wholesale prices fell by nearly 37%.  The stock market slid by 47% from November 1919 through August 1921, more severe than the 43% decline in the Panic of 1907.   From 1919 to 1922 the rate of business failures tripled, climbing from 37 failures to 120 failures per every 10,000 businesses.  Unemployment rose to nearly 12%.

This recession contributed to Harding’s winning the Presidency in 1920.  The government response under Harding was limited and targeted.  There was large-scale unemployment relief, which was initiated under Wilson.  But the largest government action was income tax cuts pushed forward by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon.

Sure, the public works and social programs did help individuals and families in the Great Depression (by the way, FDR explicitly rejected the idea of welfare.  E.g., social security was conceived as “social insurance” that workers must pay into).  But the regulatory apparatus that was erected under FDR did much to inhibit the recovery in business conditions.  In my view, this harm far outweighed the benefits of the relief programs.

"The main advantage to using a fiat currency is that inflation and deflation are stable and easy to predict over time. The use of fiat currencies allow for governments to more easily control the value of currency in depressions so people can still purchase food, pay rent, etc.

"At first glance is seems that the government is an insurmountable foe, and the odds are overwhelmingly against a revolutionary force. Tanks, missiles, chemical weapons, bombs, nukes and all that.

This is just ignorance.

Modern warfare (termed Fourth Generation warfare) is characterized by low intensity guerrilla conflict with a focus on insurgency coupled with strategic strikes against high value targets and control of public media (hearts and minds).

Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the realities of a modern US revolution.

Best estimates put the sum of our armed forces at about 2.1 million people. That's everybody from the high speed low drag operators down to the janitors and cooks. Reserves included.

Federal and State law enforcement totals about 800,000 sworn LEOs. We'll be generous and say a combined total of 3 million give or take 100,000 (remember some of those people are cross over and are counted in both categories).

So assuming that every single one of them would side with the government (which is a laughable assumption in the first place) that is a fighting force of about 3 million.

In 2012 Wisconsin issues over 600,000 hunting permits. Now some of those will cross with the ""government"" side, but let's just say half are neither LEO or military. That's 300,000 people who have experience in precision shooting, stalking, tracking, and use of camouflage. From one state.

It's estimated that there are about 100 million gun owners in the US (I'd say the number is actually much higher, but we'll use that as the number of non LEO/military gun owners as it makes things simple for the purposes of this discussion.

During the American Revolution (the one against England) it is well accepted that approximately 55% of people supported the revolutionaries, while ~25% provided material support in some way (food, shelter), about 10% provided supplies (weapons, etc.) and intel, and about 3% of the colonists did the actual fighting.

If we can assume those numbers would be consistent today, the revolutionaries could field a fighting force of about 3 million people. So just at basic clean black and white assumptions we have an equal number of combatants.

Now anyone that actually knows people in the military and law enforcement knows that not all of them are going to side with the government in a situation like this. In my opinion, if ordered to take up arms against their own people, better than half of them will refuse or desert. Many of them taking their equipment, training, and experience directly to the revolutionaries, including tanks, APCs, machine guns, rockets, and so on.

Now we come to missiles, bombs, bio/chem/nukes.

No one is going to use them. First, any commander ordering their use on American soil is more likely to be shot by their own men than to have that order carried out. That's just the facts. But for arguments sake let's say that someone was able to order a strike with a WMD on the revolutionary forces.

Can you imagine how that would swell the ranks of the other side? Pretty much anyone on the fence at all (and probably a large portion of their supporters) would instantly align with the revolutionaries.

So WMDs are pretty much right off the table.

We're left with about even man to man odds in these assumptions and all of the assumption have erred in favor of the government here.

That's 3 million revolutionaries hiding in a population of 300 million, no uniforms, a disjointed command infrastructure with cells operating independently and any given person apt to take independent yet copacetic action with the revolution at any time.

Against a force that almost exclusively wears uniforms and operates on rules of engagement that preclude mass bystander casualties (because it'll be a PR war as much as anything).

Oh, and that tricky Fourth Generation warfare thing.

It doesn't need to be a decided victory by man to man body count.

You could change the face of the country overnight by killing or capturing just 111 people.

100 senators

9 Supreme Court justices

1 Vice President

1 President

3 million against 111. It's bad odds. Pretty much an unwinnable nightmare scenario.

That aside it won't go down overnight. Armed conflict in this country? At least six months of hell on earth. Can you imagine what this country would look like after a couple of months of cops refusing to respond to any calls? That's exactly what will happen once a few dozen or hundred of them get wiped out in fake 911 call ambushes.

It'll be chaos. Gangs won't be sitting still, somebody is gonna figure out that say ""Warlord of Detroit"" is a hell of a title upgrade from Gang Leader. Not to mention the Mexican drug cartels (who are here and operating throughout this entire country. Do not let the media blackout on it fool you for a second).

You think your average person who decides to sit the main fight out is gonna just sit there while it happens? What do you think day to day life is gonna look like in this country for your average person?

Revolution would pretty much turn this country into a third world shithole overnight.

Now I'm just one guy. Who has put just a tiny bit of thought into how it might actually go down.

I'm just sayin, it's scary how easily it could happen.

The only question is what would be a big enough spark to ignite that uncontrollable blaze?

"Bush didn't lead the counter insurgency tactics. Presidents don't get into the ground level tactics of war. Those were done by the commanders on the ground. We had a tremendous COIN effort but it didn't matter because the insurgents were determined and had guns. That's all it takes. We tapped their phones. We actually tracked them by triangulating their cell phone calls too. We had informants within their organizations. We planted fake ammunition and mortars around the cities so when they tried to use it it would explode on them. We had virtually non-stop drone over-watch. We had artillery and ""armored personnel vehicles with fully automatic turrets and 6 Marines in body armor."" We had basically endless resources at our disposal. We had an extremely high numerical advantage. We had jet fighters. We had tanks. We had attack helicopters. The insurgency was actually very small in numbers. It did not enjoy popular support. Many Iraqi civilians hated the insurgents and would inform us of their plans. The insurgents didn't have a lot going for them except they had AK-47s and determination. 




>you tried to kill your way to victory



This isn't really true. The reason we lost is we fought with our hands tied behind our backs. I'm not advocating that we don't fight this way but I'm just pointing it out. If there were no Geneva Convention, no rules of war, no escalation of force rules the insurgency would have been destroyed in a matter of days. Like say we are driving through an Iraqi town and someone takes some pop shots at our vehicles. We could kill everyone within a 5 mile radius guaranteeing that the shooter was killed and acting as a deterrent to others, but we don't because that would be politically/morally unacceptable. We have B-52 bombers. We could have just carpet bombed entire cities and killed everyone. We did not try to ""kill our way to victory"".  The insurgents have no such rules. They don't wear uniforms. They don't care about civilian casualties, in fact they often targeted civilians. They use chemical/biological weapons if they can get their hands on them. I have personally been hit by a road side chlorine bomb. I've seen them blow up city buses full of civilians. I've seen them tie civilians to chairs and then, using a handheld electric drill, drill into the knee caps and then give the video to the victims' families. So it was one side obeying Geneva Conventions and one side doing whatever they wanted to win.

"They were trying to save the gold standard.

On the gold standard you can only print more dollars if you have gold to back it up. In the 1930s gold hoarding was so popular that the Fed could no longer get enough gold to increase the supply of dollars.

As a result people started hoarding dollars as well, and the supply of dollars went down by 30% in a few years as everyone pulled money out of banks, which started putting banks out of business which then led even more people to pull money out of banks out of fear the bank that had their money would go bankrupt.

This caused very high levels of deflation, so high that bartering started becoming popular again because it was so profitable to hoard dollars that no one wanted to spend them unless they absolutely had to.

Levels of investment and economic production plummeted because everyone wanted to hoard currency rather than use it to produce goods and services.

"It was obviously different people in power at the beginning of the 42 year span, and at the end.

Perhaps Nixon was being generous.  Nixon was forced to take us off the gold standard because France was draining our gold reserves.  After we took over Vietnam from them (they started it), France began converting dollars to gold as fast as they could submit the forms.  (Seems a bit ungrateful to me)  Nixon said enough is enough, we will no longer allow foreign states (normal people had not been able to do this for 42 years) to convert dollars to gold.

Perhaps Nixon knew that the dollar would begin to lose purchasing power at a high rate after this,  (it did) and he wanted to return to US citizens the ability to buy gold and preserve the purchasing power of their savings.  Nixon was looking out for us here.

This has been true since the concept of nation states existed. It just takes someone sufficiently high enough on the politcal hierarchy of a country to consciously decide to do it, and a piece of paper or old dudes in black robes aren't *actually* capable of stopping them.

Gold is in itself not any different from your paper money. Its value is predicated entirely on human projection. You can not eat it, you can not build a house with it. Its main industrious purpose is that of an electrical conductor but that's not what makes it $1,300/oz. Gold's value is predicated entirely based off of what humans believe it to be worth, just like fiat money, just like crypto. They're all the same. True wealth is derived from holding title over land, over the means of production.

"It is interesting that something as harmless as owning gold can be arbitrarily criminalized.  For decades, owning gold bullion was like being a drug addict, with people who did so being perceived by society and themselves as low-life criminals.  While prosecutions were rare, there were examples of sting operations to trap those engaged in the anti-social behavior of hoarding gold.

Nothing useful was accomplished by the gold ban.  It was just used to get around some technical issues with expanding the money supply during the depression; issues which would have been better dealt with in other ways, and eventually were.

By this example, you could criminalize anything, and that thing then becomes regarded as deviantly bad and worthy of punishment, like growing marijuana in your house.  Or co-habitating with a member of the same sex or different race (as was the case during apartheid).

There are still many harmless things that have been criminalized.  Like shipping beer by US mail or across state lines.  Other things may become so, like gun-ownership or cigarettes.

Some of these laws are mistakes, and others are deliberate attempts to change people.  Technically, it is illegal to freeze beer (that would be freeze distillation, and distilling beer to whiskey is illegal).  It is illegal to grow poppy seeds you legally buy in the grocery store (that would be manufacturing opium).  The list goes on, sigh...

My point is that the law is not a good guide to morality, but people don't much get that.  If you make something illegal, people come to think of it as immoral.";49;5;False;wjmartin100;dwug1i7;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"**Robbery**

Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by putting the victim in fear. According to common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two.

"Hoarding of currency would have happened even quicker without fractional reserve. Fractional reserve was a failed attempt at delaying the inevitable failure of a bad currency. There is no fundamental relationship between how much gold a nation has and what their demand for currency is. A pure gold standard lasted less than 100 years in the US and most other countries, and was regularly being suspended to cope with huge fluctuations in the availability and distribution of gold, and it only lasted that long because fractional reserve allowed them to meet demand above what the amount of gold would allow them to directly.

No money was destroyed during the Great Depression, exactly what deflationists want to happen happened. The Fed stopped printing new dollars, people started hoarding dollars as a result and the dollar went up 30% in value. Banks stopped loaning out money they didn't have and went bankrupt.

"That doesn't make any sense.  Deflation is a consequence of a growing economy (of people becoming more productive over time) not something that places an upper limit on economic growth.

I agree that picking a single commodity, like gold, to use as money would, if people around the world only accepted payment in that commodity, cause problems, but I don't understand why people would only ever accept payment in a single commodity.

Bitcoin is the world's first electronically tradable liquid asset (ETLA).  Until most people had smart phones with wireless internet, it made no sense for people to use ETLAs as currency.

Now that bitcoin has broken the ice, so to speak, it will allow a market of ETLAs to flourish.

If I could transfer a fractional share of IBM from my phone to yours, or any other company, or share in a basket of commodities chosen to have stable value, and there were an active currency market doing constant price discovery between the most common ETLAs, then I expect those would compete with BTC for use as currency.

I predict that is exactly what's going to happen.  If governments try to prevent non-BTC ETLAs from existing, then the price of BTC will keep going up, punishing the value of fiat currencies until they relent, at which point ETLAs and fiats will compete in an open market.

Both these points are wrong. The answer is yes this was planned. The original gold standard was not broken, it was replaced with a pseudo gold standard, that started the decoupling of gold from fiat currency. It allowed the federal reserve system to come into play and eventually the use of a global reserve currency - the US dollar - that came out of Breton Woods.

"Sorry that happened to you. Trial by popular opinion is a really shitty thing that happens far too often.

News and journalism are (read; were once) obligated to follow ethical standards such as the [""Canons of Journalism""](http://asne.org/content.asp?pl=24&sl=171&contentid=171). At the very least they should be discredited if they don't, preferably have benifits or subsidies revoked by the tax payers.
Tabloids are treated differently. They are generally not claiming to report factual news so are held to a different standard. Some anthropologists actually think gossip was a vital part of our evolution. Regardless it's always been a common pastime. 

I agree people shouldn't presume guilt without a trial. Definitely shouldn't be voicing those presumptions publicly.  
I also completely agree that the US (or any single nation) playing world police is toxic to human development.  
It's just that the risks of stifling freedom of expression far outweigh the benefits. A robust justice system *should* garentee a fair trial and compensate innocent parties for any damages the judicial process did.

"In the typical BK, creditors are getting less than 100 cents on the fiat dollar. 

If trustee takes everything to fiat, Karpelès waives his 88%, and creditors get paid out in fiat, then creditors will have an enormous fiat gain. (This sucks relative to getting paid in BTC, but preferable to receiving a pittance.)

Quite possible that there will be percentage withholding for JPN income taxes; a US taxpayer would be able to claim these as foreign taxes paid.

This guy, at least from what he's saying, is if the court rules it in the way, that he ends up with the 160k bitcoins ( that is legally his at that moment), he will try to redistribute them, as good as possible, to those who owned them.

Now if we will take his word for it, that is another thing, if the court will rule it that way, who the fuck knows, as it stands now, you are bound to get absolutely fucking nothing(maybe the fiat value of a bitcoin at that time), but what he is trying to, is to get a CR, and redistribute the money (IN BITCOIN) to the people who rightfully owned them.

"> Had MtGox announced the hack prior to bankruptcy, only part of the people would have been able to withdraw, and remaining people would be left with nothing. The purpose of bankruptcy is specifically in this kind of cases to equitably distribute whatever remains. It shouldn't take that long, however, and CoinLab is largely to blame for the delay.    

Disagreed, not open to withdraw full balance but distribute audited remaining actual balance (~25%) and then declare bankruptcy! Those btc was not belong to the MtGox (wasn't mtgox asset) and Mtgox was not bankrupt. Bankrupcy made our funds just responsible to all of debts, liabilities, suit (coinlab) for your corporation (Tibanne,Mtgox) have, what frankly does not have nothing to do with our btc/fiat and you did not do any creditor favor, just favor to your corporations with declaring bancrupcy too early, before you distribute remaining funds to users! You Mark mispresented all users btc/fiat as Mtgox asset/capital when they were just under Mtgox custody and can't be used in the company busines. You fucked us with this bankruptcy and are main reason for a delay and dilution of our funds what are used to pay for your corporation debts! You watched your own ass, so stop blaming bankruptcy laws or coinlab suit or any else in future - its your fault to be in this bankruptcy situation when we could got remaining funds long ago in 2014.";1;0;False;alfabi;dwud92f;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"> 1. The most likely is that BTC/BCH would be sold for JPY and then taxes deducted (multiple times) before I would ever see any of these. Because of the taxation issue it's likely a sale would be required in order for the value to be stable in JPY.



I apologize if you had already clarified in previous comments and I’d missed.
But, my question is, if the court decides to sell the remaining 160k BTC and remaining BCH for fiat, do you know if they will sell it on exchange?
The amounts that have been sold thus far for creditors have collapsed the crypto market and impeded the progress of crypto and widespread implementation of blockchain technology as it burnt many new investors who came in late 2017.
Would you know how they would normally sell remaining assets in Japan in bankruptcy cases? If you have a choice, please sell them off exchange!
Really appreciate you taking the time to reply to so many questions and endeavors to paying creditors the money they had lost. I can understand you’ve had a rough time yourself, but doing things right for the crypto community and investors who were affected by the collapse of Mt Gox, would right a lot of wrongs and hopefully bit more peace with your conscience. 👍

"""Sorry"" (read dozens of times in the comments below) but this reads like the next step to the exit play. You have bitcoins and you need to use them so time to start buttering up the community so you can be a part of it. As Ver has proven, nobody gives a shit about the ""taint"" of the coins. Congrats.

The extreme shadiness, the leaked transcripts, the hand-washing and ""shucks I dunnos"" while turning around and claiming all you ever wanted to do was build something good is eye-roll inducing. The buyout offers from holdings when people *wink wink* knew that somehow this would end up with Gox holding coins and people fucked were telling.

Build cleartext password in the URL? Please.

I don't feel sorry for people who fell for it. There were bound to be losers while everyone circle jerked the market manipulation together while singing the praises (until shit hits the fan).

And surprise, surprise: the lights turn on and the cockroaches scurry. Funny that, I guess it's just a coincidence. It's all just a chain of tragedies... a comedy of errors... all just bad luck and well-intentioned mistakes. 

I cannot answer that due to legal. I cannot answer that because I'm nowhere to be found. I cannot answer that because I was trying to fix things. I cannot answer that because if I told the truth that'd be the end.

"> Why did MtGox keep assuring us up to the very last few days before it closed down for good, that our bitcoins were fucking safe?

Literally the only question I care about in this entire thread, including who wrote the script roger was reading in his video.

To this day the only obvious answer is that this was deception on Mark's part to try and prevent a bank run from making things worse.

People who play the house of cards get so deep they rationalize any scenario to justify the continuation of the house of cards.

I do not know what quid pro quo occured between Mark and Roger for the video, but *I damn well know there was one*. Only a fool thinks Roger put his entire reputation on the line for nothing. The most likely scenario was Roger wanted to get some of his btc out of Mt Gox in exchange for some PR.

To this day this is still one of the biggest unanswered scandals. Its obvious what happened, but we still get no admission from Mark or Roger as to the *actual reason* behind lying.

[Marks](/u/magicaltux) response was a bunch of bullshit. Spun meaningless words. Obviously mark was at the helm of the PR and coordinated with roger to put that statement out.

"Well, I am sorry for misconstruing your post as a realistic expectation.

It seems clearer now that what you are saying is that when calling customer service, you don’t expect to be lied to.  I’d agree that that is reasonable and proper.  But Mr Karpeles is saying above that customer service didn’t know that the company was in trouble when they were telling customers everything is fine.

"Here's [the link to the Forbes Bitcoin article](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html#65b4236f353e). Three days after the article, Bitcoin actually achieved parity with the Euro.

And then in June 2011, there was the famous [Gawker Silk Road article](http://gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160) which brought price to $31.91 and four days later caused US senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin [to urge FBI to shut down Silk Road](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-16/bitcoins-currency-of-the-geeks#p1), spotlighting Bitcoin as the only way of payment on illegal market.

This chain of events led to US government looking into Bitcoin, and ultimately the Department of Homeland security seizing MtGox's Wells Fargo and Dwoilla accounts on May 9th and 15th 2013. This left MtGox without $5 million in customer funds. The reason for this was, I suspect, because MtGox was the biggest exchange where people got their bitcoins for spending on Silk Road, although it was done under pretense of MtGox allegedly not giving correct info in some money transmitter forms filed in the US.

My personal theory was that MtGox solvency problems actually started in May 2013 due to the seized accounts. /u/MagicalTux, can you confirm or deny that this was the case?";2;2;False;domchi;dwuctce;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"I also have problems with it, but I think the idea is that it is an exception in the sense that it IS the ""usual"" punishment and people should stop before they are subject to it.

It isn't so much that future people who are caught won't be held to the same standard. It is that nobody ""wants"" to hold anyone to those standards, and by making it clear what they are most alleged criminals will stop committing the crime

Think of it like cops on a highway. When you see someone pulled over, you slow down to the actual speed limit, not the +5 mph most people drive at. The idea is that by giving that person a ticket more people will drive the speed limit, but it doesn't mean only that person would get a ticket.

Obviously traffic citations aren't the best example due to their impact on funding public works, but the idea of making an example of someone to keep everyone else in line holds.

"i hate people who act like a judge and write things that are not proven yet. i was sitting in custody for 10 months and the press wrote shit as fuck, while at the end i got out on a plea deal for total different things and just 3% of what the press wrote.

let's just wait till his trial is over. apparently it's disgusting that the US can run through the world and arrest people who never even stepped with a foot into their country. It's also disgusting that they now really want to extradite him to put him on trial and then keep him 25 years in a jail in the US. 

whatever he did, it's not US business. if you think it's okay the US become world police, then i hope you never do something wrong in another country, which the US doesn't like.

at the end: he is not sentenced yet, he didn't even had a trial and never spoke or defend himself. everybody has a right to do so before we should start judging people. 

free speech does not imply to say: **he is guilty, he did this and this....**. Free speech just gives humanity the right to say what they want and think.
of course you are allowed to say that you think he did it. but then write it this way rather then acting like it's a fact.

"You know nothing of the law 

First off the CDA 230 provision applies to civil cases and not criminal ones but clearly, you didn't know that because, as stated before and proven then, you are a moron

secondly, the CDA 230 protect the web service provider to this extent: as long as they were ignorant of activities taking place on its pages, they weren’t liable for them

thirdly The CDA 230 deals with information and does not extend to the subject at hand

But mostly point 1 where the CDA does not protect web providers from criminal liability as law states

Again you are arguing without merit...The case was just and the law was upheld twice and Ross got much less time than he deserved but then comes a moron to defend him like you...Oops! 

And on the off chance you didn't get it: Yes Craigslist would be liable for something advertised on their website if that was part of a criminal offense. That's mainly why sites like Reddit censor content and respond to reports from users because failing to do so puts them in jeopardy 

The CDA 230 is not a blanket immunity and this has been shown many times
