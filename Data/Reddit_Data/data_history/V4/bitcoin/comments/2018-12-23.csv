Uhm, not true. Clock speed fluctuate to save power when the power isnt needed. You can, if you want to, set for max clock all the time but i choose not to have my card full speed when im on my desktop... Your cards, when mining, go full tilt unless you set them otherwise, limit or overclock. Clock speeds vary per manufacturer as do the chips they use.

"Well, yeah....My only gripe is that I can find high quality LSD and they *do* store it great. Also hadda guy who grew fungus for awhile&Extracted Deemster, But yeah. That took me a long time for these connects.
However, Good Cocaine is hard to find anywhere nowadays, and most people just buy Meth as it's stronger and longer lasting of a high. 
But when I first started using the darknet, I was in high school or just graduated, and I used it to either make money from people who couldn't find Psychedelics, fake ID's(for buying alcohol under age) and Getting free samples of Opioids. But yeah, most street dealers sell Opioids, Stimulants, Benzo's, and Weed. Those are the main drugs you can find everywhere, and like we both said, no Addict is gonna wait to get his dope when he could just drive to his homeboys house and get high right then and there. 
I actually used to get 200g's of MDMA Shipped in from Amsterdam on the *Weekly* and made a killing doing this years ago, right as the big Molly craze started going on. Sold from Washington all the way down to AZ and man, that Shit was fire.....Then my connect got arrested....Sad, Sad day...

"They are hard to find, and you never get good quality locally. The dealer is always an ignorant guy that has no idea what LSD is, how it should be kept and all the consequences. 

He probably keeps 20 blotters in his sweaty pocket during the summer, or inside his phone's case. But LSD will degrade because of light, heat, salt, chlorine and lots of other circumstances. There are less complications for MDMA, Mushrooms, Mescaline, 2CB and other substances in the psychedelic and entactogen categories, but still, they don't really care about specialty drugs that don't cause addiction. 

Dealers prefer straightforward drugs, that will bring regular clients, and don't cause long trips and psychedelic effects. That is why 90% of all the dealers will choose one or more of these three substances: Marijuana, Cocaine, Heroin. Nowadays you'll also find lots of guys selling prescription opiates (Hydrocodone), benzodiazepines (Xanax) and Speed (Amphetamine). These are the street dealers and also the most successful ones. I don't know much about the US, but from films and news, I know Methamphetamine is the fourth drug, sold as frequently as the three originals. 

Club dealers often work for the club owner, or give him and his bodyguards a cut. They mainly sell Ecstasy/MDMA, Speed, Ketamine, GHB, N2O and also some specialty Phenetylamines (2C-x, Nbomes, Mescaline etc.)

Anyway, psychedelics are the most researched and sold psychoactive substances nowadays (online). Not to mention all the tech guys that started microdosing these last years. Their only source: darknet markets. 

Addicts don't buy drugs on the internet. Even if they could wait, and had the money upfront, they wouldn't go through the hassle of learning how to access the deepweb, use cryptocurrencies, VPN, private PO box and so on and so forth. 

Darknet markets were primarily used by curious youngsters, psychonauts, psychologists/psychiatrists and such. Maybe a group of swaggers buying some pills for a big concert. 

And another big percentage were the dealers. It's way more safe buying large quantities of drugs online, than meeting up with the friend of a friend in a dark alley at night. Chances to get arrested or mugged are too high. Those that know the internet, and are smart and dedicated enough to learn anonymity and crypto: They use these markets.
