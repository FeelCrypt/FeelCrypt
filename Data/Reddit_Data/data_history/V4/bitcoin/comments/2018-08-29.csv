Lol.  The iPhone.  Okay.  The company that was the first to break a trillion?  That iPhone?  Yeah, I wish with the iPhone 3 came out I bought apple.  There is literally nothing to compare this to.  You can't say this is more of a bubble than the other 3 times it looked like it and skyrocketed past that point.  You can only define a bubble in retrospect.  I assume sense you know the future of Bitcoin you have tens of thousands of dollars invested shorting it right?

"> There is literally nothing to compare this to. 

You're high. This is just like any other technology. New stuff comes out, old stuff dies out. No one is using the iPhone 3g. Bitcoin is as old as the iPhone 3g, and there have been even more ""models"" of cryptocurrency released afterwards than there have been iPhones. Bitcoin has absolutely no technical value in the crypto market. 

>You can't say this is more of a bubble

It has always been a bubble.

According to you, to say someone bought Bitcoin at $.001 to today would just be in a 6 year bubble.  You can try to say it's a scam, it isn't, but you can say that.

"> That statement doesn't even make sense

Then you're disabled.

>People did buy stock in ""iPhone"" by buying apple

Yes, clearly disabled. 

We were talking about a specific iteration of technology. We're not talking about Apple. We're not talking about iPhones in general. Neither of those are corrolaries to BTC. You cannot buy stock in BTC. BTC is not a company. BTC is one iteration of a particular technology, and an old model at that. BTC is the iPhone 3g, and equally outdated.

>to say someone bought Bitcoin at $.001 to today would just be in a 6 year bubble.

Correct. You don't seem to know what a bubble is. People can absolutely make money in bubbles, but it's made in a volatile and speculative fashion based in no actual value that ultimately zeroes out. 

>you don't understand finances.

I'm guessing you don't really understand anything.";1;1;False;;e50pg4v;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

">  a technology that has been around less than a decade

So, like the Iphone 3g? Expecting those to go up in price too? Technology gets real old, real fast, and early models get replaced quickly. There is nothing BTC does that isn't done better by another crypto, and that's even assuming crypto does something worth doing. There is no inherent value to BTC, and it's severely outdated as a platform.

>has a history that shows it has to fail

Yes, it very clearly mimicks just about every other bubble in the history of the market. It's in a major downtrend. There is absolutely no logical reason to expect a recovery.

>We will see who is right here.

No, *you* will see who is right here, eventually and far too late. *We* know who is right.
