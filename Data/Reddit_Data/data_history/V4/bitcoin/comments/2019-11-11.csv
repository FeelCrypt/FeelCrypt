How can you think the government wont step in and regulate your bitcoin. They can literally just tell companies not to accept it. They can fine you for using it. They can do whatever they want and theres nothing you can do about it. How do you not recognize that.

It doesn’t change anything, it’s just a fact. What you suggested is that a government banning bitcoin would cause a significant decline in its value. Well, are you sure about that? If Venezuela suddenly banned Bitcoin (which lately seems like the opposite of what they’ve been doing), it wouldn’t really affect the value that I place on Bitcoin, and I doubt it would make a radical change in other people’s valuations.;2;1;False;anon2414691;f7743vc;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png

"I'd describe Y and Z as digital natives. People who have spent their whole lives using digital technology and who feel comfortable with it. I would also say that a key identifying aspect of their identity for many ""ok boomer"" conversations is that they expect to live for more than a few more decades. Say 30 years or more.

The typical boomer attitude does not expect to remain alive for long, nor does it much care what happens after that. They want their social security payouts, their medicare, their cheap gas and inhabitable planet. But they do not want anyone else to have a stable social security system, subsidized medicine or public option insurance, renewable fuel sources or a stable climate.

"That's where the intrinsic value argument comes into play.

Even if gold loses 99% of its value in a mining boom, it has intrinsic value that can be traded up in markets. As a manufacturing material, a low price would spur broader use in electronic manufacturing. 

Here's an example. Solar panels of the near future may well incorporate gold to improve efficiency, and if early market trends are anything to go by solar power could end up dominating the energy sector. So manufacturing developments and a low gold price could end up buoying its value. 

On the other hand, a vast majority of Bitcoin's current value is owed solely to speculative interest by institutions and retail traders. It has no intrinsic value.

What will I do with it? Why would I ever give you something useful like food or water or horses or guns or women or even particularly nice straight sticks in exchange for your collection of gold?

The only use for gold is to trade it for something else. The only way anyone would want it is if it could be relied upon as a means of exchange because other people wanted it.

You have invented this impossible scenario in your head to try to make Bitcoin useless and Gold not, and even if I give you the magic wand to make any kind of world you want you have failed.

"I'm not arguing with you in this post...this is good faith discussion, don't misconstrue it for anything else, I learned from your post and I might add a bit that's all, I'm not arguing back at you we are on the same page.

There are several alternatives to the minimum wage. Basic Income, Negative Income Tax (We do this to some extent with EITC), strong collective bargaining rights...I think there might be one I'm neglecting here.

But the Peter Schiff crowd, from what I've seen balk at ALL of those alternatives. And the most powerful political party closest to their economics do as well. 

They don't believe in a basic income...they don't believe in collective bargaining, basically when Republicans run things they try to kill unions and they've largely been successful as massively crippling most unions except maybe police. And we do have EITC but it appears to largely only benefit poverty stricken families...single adults are just sol on that one. And make no mistake, poverty stricken families do have mouths to feed, but single low income working adults aren't doing well either,however in 2017, 26 million FAMILIES redeemed that benefit, but for me personally I'm an ugly mofo to womankind, so for me it's not an option...and I work a job that wouldn't qualify me for EITC anyways because it pays relatively good if I work super hard and super long hours, 168 hours week in essence.

For me personally, I want widespread collective bargaining, I want as a worker, a seat at the table on how the profits are distributed, and standards in the work place that benefit the worker. I'm doing the leg work, I never have time to myself, and yes I will be changing my employer, but essentially, I live to work, I don't work to live, there is NO free time with this job, OTR mega carrier trucker if you want to make a quote unquote ""decent"" living.

But there is just so many different programs for poor and close to minimum wage working adults, I just sort of assume on most matters, they are going to be hostile to everything that helps those people, I generally bat well going in with that mindset talking to Peter Schiff types.

It's one thing to be opposed to minimum, and rally the political party that is behind this opposition to a good alternative, but my observations for the most part, is they oppose close to everything, I'm talking as a collective, even if a scant few support a legit alternative to minimum wage like collective bargaining, the other majority of guys in that crowd will come out just as hardcore against that solution as raising the minimum wage.";2;1;False;SuperJew113;f77yowr;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png
