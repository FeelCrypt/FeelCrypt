The username was similar to the real name of a high ranking official in russian intelligence. From my own analysis I have seen plenty of evidence that directly links Russian intelligence to the DNC hack, more than enough to convince me beyond reasonable doubt who was behind it, almost everything they did is identical to how Russian intelligence operates and I've seen enough evidence to convince me it wasn't a false flag.

"They didn't ""hack the NSA"". Just one of their boxes that had the exploits on it. Back when Kaspersky (a Russian security firm might I add) did their analysis on some NSA malware they discovered, they posted the IP addresses of the command-and-control servers that the malware exfiltrates data too. Most of these servers were immediately taken offline, however some were left online for some time. This is likely because these servers were involved in ongoing operations and changing the IP on the implant would risk compromising the op. I had the opportunity to scan these IP addresses and discovered that they were hosted at many different hosting providers and while most ran Ubuntu, some ran CentOS and other linux-based OS's. They likely did this to hide the CNC servers. However this inconsistency is not good and increases the likelyhood of a hack. It's possible that one of the hosting providers was social engineered into giving the attacker access to the server (which is likely registered with fake details, I doubt the server was registered to the NSA), or the hosting provider was hacked and the hacker was able to pivot into the server, or that some software that was used on one specific server was vulnerable, and that these exploits were kept on this server.";26;0;False;cowardlyalien;d6iy8y5;NSA hacked!

But everywhere now you see the media repeating trite stories of scary Russians, and no discussion on the content of the leak. It's not a grand conspiracy theory, it's a complicated system of incentives. The Clinton Machine has steered the media before and practiced quid pro quo for people like DWS breaking the rules to help the Clinton Machine. That's what the leak was about. Now we see the media all aligned on the Russian spin, and no talk about the content of the leak. It's classic misdirection, and it benefits Clinton immensely.

"I have not once suggested they would actually ""use"" Bitcoin as a currency for exchange of value. My whole premise is that they wish to have the ability to influence currencies that are created outside their sphere of influence should they need. Especially because with the Chinese owning so much US debt, and the Chinese owning a major part of the BTC mining pools they have to find a way into the game (even if it is a tiny tiny game)

Think about it as a deterrent if you like. Russia and USA used nukes as exactly that, but during the height of the cold war they were both only minutes from launching them. Yet other countries bought the tech (and developed their own, eg France, UK, Israel) just to make sure they had a voice at the table and influence and one tiny tiny threat.

Private blockchain tech will save central banks some accounting steps, and that's one future, but who the hell is going to buy the USDcoin? Seriously, who would buy something like that? Would any govt ever bring about a digital-only currency? That would be tantamount to accepting that the existing fiat can be replaced by arbitrary digital tokens. One day perhaps. People are dumb and it will take years to buy into that. It won't happen in my lifetime.

We could go on into a deep level of analysis of what the US Govt or any other govt might or might not do in the future with their own coins or etc etc but the fundamental point I made right at the top is that the NSA has every reason to be holding bitcoins because it is the prudent strategy whilst BTC leads the market. It doesn't matter why, or even how, just that it is entirely logical to buy into the weaponry.

"true to an extent, but until BTC crashes to zero (predicted many times but never yet got close to happening) it remains the fundamental and first implementation of blockchain tech, so all govts and banks are bound by their own curiosity to keep a close eye on it (ie buying some to learn from, if nothing more)

Personally I like the idea of a trustless decentralized network protocol (eg BTC but not exclusively) much more than some private blockchain tech that is designed only to save transfer costs for the already rich. Whether the former ever fully prevails is an interesting thought experiment, but other cryptos have already established that it is a possibility.

Indeed the Russians or Chinese or any nation might also have stockpiled BTC reserves. It isn't too far fetched to imagine that.


BTC is the biggest single 'uncontrollable' threat to the financial system out there, so to them it would be sensible to hold an anonymous stake simply to be able to take a position should it ever be deemed necessary. They have no accountability for the cost of acquiring and realistically it would be the prudent position to take.

Not exactly ""sources"" but I could google and reference some more honest news media.
The evidence for Hillary arming Isis insurgents is in the emails which are not released yet, and the FBI is holding them because the emails also implicate most other branches of government in crime and collusion. A huge shitstorm is emerging and people are wondering who they should throw under the bus, or if they can sweep it under the rug.  Constant balance between the two. If Russia or some other power releases the rest of the emails, we are screwed. That is why Trump calling for Russia to release the emails is dangerous for the USA.

"The investment is simply insurance to give them significant leverage because they cannot take *n* bitcoin holders and put them in solitary just to yield control of *n* times *x* BTC - that is an expensive and ineffective way to try and gain control of substantial numbers of coins when they can simply buy them on the open market (which possibly has a side effect of actually stabilizing the coin against all the shit exchange scams and collapses that are currently, I agree, part of the problem with BTC)

The US govt has been doing nasty things for years. The only nastiness they can inflict on BTC (other than your example of seizing hardware from known holders and coercion) is to have a stake which is substantial enough to damage from within the mechanism of the Libertarian ideal.

Against what? Do you really think they would not take a view that ""what"" is somewhat unknown so logically they would want to have the ability (if not the current motivation) to be able to shape the outcome of the ""what"" should the need arise?

idk ""what"" I'll admit, and I couldn't say they are necessarily ""against"" it, simply that it is cheap and easy for them to gain an amount of leverage in a largely anonymous system so that's going to be their best option.

"The Yellowstone caldera is a danger which the government monitors at some modest expense but if it blew then they would only have some token emergency stocks of whatever they deem necessary, because it would be far too costly to prepare for that unpredictable event and it would be a truly global catastrophe so there's little point pretending a plan exists to deal with it.

Katrina was a disaster which could be said to have been a failing by the various entities who were given responsibility to anticipate, mitigate and prevent the damage. And a lack of planning and funds before, during and after.

I don't think they ""need"" bitcoin, but I don't see a convincing argument to ignore it at NSA top levels. It is a trivial investment to insure against BTC threatening the system more than they might possibly wish to happen.

Note that this only works if your target address has been spent from in the past. So, you would start by taking a previous transaction that spent coins at the target address you want to steal from. Call the signature in this transaction S, and the data that it signed T. So S is a valid signature for sha256(T). (This is how ECDSA works, the hash of the message is signed, not the message itself because the message itself is too long). Now, create a new transaction that sends coins to an address you control, call this new stealing transaction T1. Abuse the SHA-256 exploit to modify T1 such that its hash is equal to sha256(T). Now take the old valid signature, S, and add it to this new transaction. Boom, you've created a new valid transaction spending bitcoins you didn't previously have the private key for.;14;1;False;leijurv;d6iyz4o;NSA hacked!

"is it?


Assuming the NSA annual budget is somewhere between 10B USD (Wikipedia 2013 figure ) and 52B USD (Snowden 2013 figure) then accumulating a stockpile of BTC over time (for other 'political' purposes such as entrapment or simply to have a stake that might be sufficient to harm the overall stability of the currency) is far from out of the question, especially given the fact that BTC is perceived generally as a threat (albeit small in governmental terms at this point in time)


Is it difficult to imagine that US agencies have been secretly accumulating BTC for many years and have 'invested' heavily into something unpredictable which they would, by habit, prefer to have some leverage over?

"I think a major roadblock in the way of bitcoin getting mass acceptance is from the community itself. We struggle to try and see the use of bitcoin out of our own frame of reference. 

As a business owner, bitcoin at this time does not offer me any benefits over traditional banking means, and furthermore, has some serious downsides. Non-reversible transactions would leave me at a severe disadvantage to my suppliers. My tax situation would become much more complex. And frankly, the majority of users seem to care more about increasing the value of bitcoin over spending it and increasing usage. 

Per the US debt, the vast majority of US debt is owned by US citizens, states, and local governments. One of the things that makes me laugh about Trump claiming he is going to force the the creditors of US debt to take a haircut is he is literally saying he is going to fuck over the people voting for him. The fact that China owns something like 8% of US debt would make them more inclined not to encourage the US of a non-USD currency. 

This is part of the disconnect I see when people on /r/bitcoin assume that a deflationary currency is necessarily good. A high USD versus other currency kills US exports. The other frustrating disconnect I see here is the assumption that the banking industry does not change with technology or time. This is not true at all. If anything, bitcoin is effectively starting over the banking industry and ignoring hard learned lessons...which is why we see the same frustratingly low tech scams again and again. 

Per the NSA or another branch of the US government actively fucking with bitcoin at this time, I just don't really see the point. There is any number of ways they could derail it at a later time without involving purchasing bitcoin. One of the problems with bitcoin is that so few coins actually move in meaningful amounts that any single whale could cause a major price drop. Find a single whale, do an audit or something along those lines to force a whale to sell a bunch of coins and the bottom falls out. 

In my opinion, the blockchain has a future...its just that bitcoin is not that future necessarily. There are too few people sitting on far too many coins. The deflationary nature leads to problems (such as Greece where they cannot inflate their currency and lessen their economic dysfunction). To be clear, I am not saying that inflation is necessarily good. What you want is a predictable amount of inflation to encourage long term investment in an economy. Deflation tends to gridlock the economy until only base consumption is met. And while the claim that de-centralized is good, must like deflation, I would not say this is always true. Bitcoin, in its present format, struggles with making any real time adjustments. It take far too long to come up with any sort of consensus.

Ah but I am rambling. I am far from being an expert in anything and I appreciate the time and effort you made in this conversation.
