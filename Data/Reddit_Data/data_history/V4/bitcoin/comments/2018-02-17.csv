"> Could I set my home computer to chug away at the problem for an hour a day and have a chance at just being given a whole coin?

Yes, in theory. You can try mining Bitcoin on your home computer, but the chances of you actually finding a block are incredibly close to zero. And if you do find a block, you get 12.5 BTC, not just one of them.

People join mining pools, and work together on finding blocks. Then when anyone in the pool finds a block everyone who worked towards it gets a share of the rewards.

It's still not worth doing unless you have specialized equipment.

The title already says 3 million (2.9 to nitpick), your edit just proves you never even read the article.

We're arguing that the extent of her network is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than 3 million, and the high water mark next to her name is 77 million, [where she tweeted about BTC](https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/964287117466640389).

It was a comedy sketch, that's all. It's nice that she made it sound positive for the most part since she could have made fun of the crash and ended on a bad note. As for exposure, It may have raised curiosity of a few new people but this by no means is a major feat. It also hasn't made Bitcoin price moon or anything.

"The rule is that you can't trade on insider information. Usually that means if there is something damning about a stock/asset and you know before everybody else, then you can't trade on that information before it becomes public (Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO before the Intel Spectre/Meltdown debacle, or the CEO of Equifax before the hack was made public). I suppose a corollary might be that you can't buy in on knowledge that something big is about to happen, for example a new product is about to be released. To deal with this ""insiders"", usually employees of such companies who were given RSUs, are allowed to buy/sell their stock at specific times.

I'd guess in the case of Elon Musk that as long as he's not selling his stock he can pump Tesla/SpaceX as much as he wants.

As for Ellen I have no idea how this applies to crypto. I suppose you could consider a pump-and-dump market manipulation. But if she just holds the coin, I don't think it would be illegal. But if she pumps it as she sells and then it plummets and a lot of here listeners lose money, maybe that's a securities violation?

But even then I'm not so sure because Bitcoin isn't a security. Although she basically represented it as an investment product which might be enough to make her liable.

Does anybody else know how they deal with market manipulation in commodities markets?";4;0;False;enqueued;dud9chq;Ellen DeGeneres Just Introduced Bitcoin to Her 3 Million US Viewers;7xz6ww;http://bitcoinist.com/ellen-degeneres-introduced-bitcoin-viewers/

"In fact there really is no such thing. It is redundant since technically all radios  are wireless but the term was commonly in use in the US throughout the 1930's.  Telegraphs and telephones both predate wireless communication so people understood that technology when the radio was invented.  Since it was a new invention nobody really had any idea what a radio was. The term wireless radio appeared more often in print than simply the word radio until the the late 1930's when the technology caught on enough for the average person to have been exposed to it and to no longer need the wireless description. 

But that's really my point. Bitcoin is so much more than internet money or virtual currency but it's still so new that the word Bitcoin is still mostly meaningless to most people.

Question: I assume that, if you own privacy coins, you could buy stuff (black market probably) from someone who would take that coin (let's say Monero). IMHO, then there's no way to trace that transaction. On the other hand, what if you went to Europe and wanted to buy a cheap car from someone who would only take bitcoin or euros ? So then you exchange your Monero into either of these two in order to buy the car. Would that not be pretty difficult to trace and what would flag the IRS anyway ?

"Seems like HODLers, in most cases, will be buying BTC or ETH to send to an exchange for buying altcoins. So, if I buy NEO and thus selling my BTC , a taxable event occurs even though the whole process took under 30 minutes. In other words, the small gain or loss there is paltry and they probably average out over time anyway ... and how could you possibly keep track of all that ? 
And getting back into dollars from the NEO - then you have TWO taxable events both taking place possibly within 30 minutes or less. If this is our tax code, then it is absolutely absurd.
