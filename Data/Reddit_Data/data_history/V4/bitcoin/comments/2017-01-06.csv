That's what supply and demand curves are, they plot the number of people willing to buy and sell at different prices. Where the lines intersect (I.e. The number of people willing to sell = the number of people willing to buy) dictates the market price and quantity ;2;0;False;;dc1xvv5;$902;5m5ick;https://i.redd.it/troiu3tw5v7y.jpg

Coinbase will let you make instant trades straight from the interface, true... But if you want to blow a bit of money trading on coinbase you can jump on their actual exchange (gdax) and transfer funds into/out of it free. There you can mess around with limit and stop loss orders in addition to the market orders you're doing on coinbase proper... Limit orders are free, go have some fun.;6;0;False;didact;dc20dwa;$902;5m5ick;https://i.redd.it/troiu3tw5v7y.jpg

If you look at the price bubble of 2013, you will see that there was a steep decline very similiar to the one we are seeing now right before the real rally began. Bitcoin will go up to several thousand dollars next, then fall down and stabilize between 1500 and 2500 dollars. ;1;0;False;burstup;dc2khju;$902;5m5ick;https://i.redd.it/troiu3tw5v7y.jpg
