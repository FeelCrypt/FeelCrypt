You're right that both major parties are primarily comprised of corporate minions. No doubt about that. But there is no way at all that 100% of Republicans would be for a ban. Think about it: until last year Republicans had control of both houses of congress, and they didn't make any effort to bad crypto-currencies. Now that the Democrats have the House, a Democratic Congressman from California is proposing banning all cryptos. Some members of both parties would support that bill, but I'm guaranteeing you that not all Republicans would support it, and I'm betting more Democrats than Republicans would vote for that bill to ban cryptos.

"Next people wearing windbreakers start kicking down your doors, and if that doesn't work then drones start dropping bombs through your ceiling.   


I really think the entire community is grossly underestimating how big a pain in the ass the government can be if they come down hard on cryptocurrency. 

&#x200B;

Imagine if every single crypto exchange was made illegal overnight (this has happened before with online poker payment processors becoming illegal overnight).  Next imagine that local bitcoins and bisq became massive honeypots where people started getting busted by undercover cops constantly and getting thrown in jail for money laundering.  Next imagine any merchant that accepts bitcoins will be threatened with legal action and a few would even get raided in the middle of the day for accepting bitcoin (this happened with landlords that were leasing properties to cannabis dispensaries before they became legal).  

&#x200B;

What do you think the state of bitcoin would be in this scenario?  Ledger/Trezor won't be able to ship wallets into America without getting seized by customs at the border.  Apple and Google won't allow bitcoin apps in the app store for Americans so you'd have to Jailbreak for mobile, or run your own full node that you'd have to install yourself. 

&#x200B;

Literally no one will go through that much trouble in the U.S. Everything I listed above has happened in one shape of form to other things the government has decided to set their targets on (drugs, online gambling, prostitution, etc) and taking down the handful of services that are crypto/fiat onramps and offramps would be TRIVIALLY easy for the government to do if they wanted to.  I can list all of the places you can exchange bitcoin for dollars on two hands.  Maybe even one hand.  Of course bitcoin will survive internationally in the more free countries, but for all of us here we'll just be blacked out.   


I think we need to seriously stop taunting regulators and constantly poking the bear when we are so vulnerable.

"Is this guy a Democrat or Republican?  I can't tell the big government / deep state guys apart sometimes...

Edit: Ok just checked:  He's a Democrat.  From California no less.  Congrats to the California Democrats...

Edit(2): I love that they're worried.  It shows respect at a deep level. But let's not forget these deep state bureaucrats like Rep. Sherman can wield incredible power, and if the USA were to try to ban cryptocurrencies, as ridiculous as it might seem, and as impossible as it would be to do in any complete way, it would be a huge blow for adoption and would set us back a lot.

Just one little problem: any such ban would be a violation of the 1st amendment of the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution, the highest law of the land.  The Supreme Court of the U.S. has consistently held that both code and money are protected speech.  So, sure, go ahead and try to pass your silly law, but it will be struck down in the end.;17;2;False;Always_Question;emyj5am;Today in Congress Rep.

"[Brad Sherman is the Democratic representative from California's 30th district](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00006897&cycle=2018), and he is heavily supported by the fintech/banking industry. So yes, he is deliberately misrepresenting cryptocurrency technologies because they threaten his largest contributors.

Fuck him, he's a piece of shit. He doesn't care about the American people or even about ""financing terrorists"", he is too busy aiding the wealthy to further increase the financial disperity of Americans.
