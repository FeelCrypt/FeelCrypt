"It is a shillcoin. The people pushing for it are trying to trick people into thinking it's the main Bitcoin, and using incredibly shady PR tactics to do it. it doesn't solve the scaling problem, just postpones it while making it require better computers to mine and run a node, which further centralizes the system, that thing you claim not to want.

Yeah, but it was like this like 20 days ago too. Dropped from 20k to 13k around the 22nd, rose to 16k around Boxing Day and then dropped to 13k again before getting to what it is now.

"**Dot-com bubble**

The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the dot-com crash, the Y2K crash, the Y2K bubble, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet by businesses and consumers. During this period, many Internet-based companies, commonly referred to as dot-coms, were founded, many of which failed.

During 2000–2002, the bubble collapsed. Some companies, such as Pets.com and Webvan, failed completely and shut down.

"Every transaction you make is absolutely the wrong one, on a short timeline (you'll never hit the perfect short term top or bottom).

Can make 10-20% easy, in a couple hours, sometimes less, sometimes more, if you pay decent attention and have reasonable goals.

"I'm a btc supporter personally, but this is all kinds of dumb.

""Making it require better computers to mine and run a node...""
You haven't been able to mine btc on a cpu for years. BCH hasn't changed that. 
I assume when you say better you mean HD space. I think IF they had full blocks it would require like 400GB a year. But, they don't even have close to full blocks, and if they did that means the adaption/use rate is at least 8 times more than it is now.

""...despite the theoretical  possible need to have service providers...""
LN will only be useful if you setup a channel with one party where you transact many times. Opening a channel for one transaction would incur two fees making it meaningless. 
LN requires you to lock funds into the channel. Only a large hub can afford to lock funds into many channels. How many channels can you afford to lock funds in? Finally, no one says it's not ""cryptographically secure"". The argument I see made most is that it allows the hub used to route transactions to censor them i.e. funds to a certain user/address can be blocked by the hub

You can call bch'ers shills. But you really need to acknowledge that there are valid criticisms to be made about LN.";2;1;False;microgoatz;dsay2ns;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"This is what we know:

> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.

No one knows anything further than that. If they say they do, they are lying.

What does it mean? Well, you'll have to think for yourself and decide.

I'm not sure quite how the trade fees are determined, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply priority. You and Bob both want to send a transaction. Bob is willing to pay $0.50 more. You get booted; better luck next block (which happens every 10 minutes by design).

This system implies that there will be fewer and fewer lotteries to win, since there are a predetermined number of coins. That means the entire system will transition to trade fees.

Meaning we will eventually see a period where miners abandon bitcoin en masse, as they realize no one is willing to pay a trade fee that matches the current value of the coin. (The trade fee would have to be as least as much as the current lottery, since the current lottery is what justifies throwing so much computing power into it.)

This is the fate of Bitcoin. It cannot be argued, though many will try.

If Satoshi were still alive, he'd probably be stepping in right about now saying ""Wait! I only put the cap on to increase adoption and give a healthy network with lots of mining power. We still have an endgame to think about. We need to remove the cap on BTC and make it a consistent 5% inflation per year.""

But people think Satoshi would have said a lot of things. Either way, this is his legacy the world idolizes.";1;1;False;palish;dsb7bk8;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"In addition to what others have said, there are a few other theoretical ideas behind why it has value:

* It was designed from day one to be a trustless currency and store of value separate from any central control, meaning no government or bank has the ability to print more money (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created) or prevent you from sending money anywhere, etc.

* It is pseudonymous -- it is very difficult to trace a particular account back to a particular person. It *is* possible to trace transactions in certain circumstances, especially when using external aggregate info (like the IRS demanding info from Coinbase) but in general it is pretty private.

* It is extremely secure and well-designed. The original designer solved two of the toughest problems in computer science history to invent it, and it has been upgraded over the years by some of the best cryptographers on the planet.

* It is very censorship-resistant and attack-resistant. Look up the term ""anti-fragile"" -- basically every time it is attacked (hundreds of times now) it just gets stronger. This makes people trust it more.

* It takes an *extreme* amount of electricity to mine it. The mining network is effectively orders of magnitude stronger than the fastest supercomputer -- it was [four exahashes per second in 2016](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-four-exahash-per-second/) and ""the growth of mining pools has led many people to believe bitcoin is the most secure computational network in history.""

"In addition to having value because people will buy it, it has value because it has utility - Bitcoin is a different way to think about money.

* You can send Bitcoin to anyone with internet access without worrying about banks or borders in less time than the legacy banking system.

* You can store money with Bitcoin without worrying about physically storing or protecting gold or physical bills - you can even memorize a series of words so that your bitcoins can only be accessed by you, and you can do so anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

>Thats what people meant when they say yeah they can work harder to get that promotion only to move up in the tax bracket to be rewarded with a bigger portions of your earning being taken

This is an incredibly common misconception. When you move up a tax bracket you're taxed more *only on the money that is above the previous bracket*. So if you make just below a 40k tax cutoff and are taxed at 20%, if you get bumped to 50k and are now paying 30%, you're only paying 30% taxes on the 10K above the cutoff. You're still taxed at 20% on the 40k. So you're taxed more, but in no way do you make less money... you are always earning money.

"Let me explain the logic to you then.

It's like you betting on a coinflip with me for 10 dollars.  But you only get 5 dollars if you win.  The other 5 gets taxed.

So you stand to lose 10 but at best only win half because of tax.  Is that still a bet you're willing to go through?  Better think twice.


Now if you rigged the coin and you know you'll win no matter what, then of course it doesn't matter what tax there is as long as it's not 100% you'll go all in.  But can you really say that about crypto?

You're risking every dollar you put into it.  Nobody reimburse you when your investment fails.  But on the off chance your hard work do suceed.  Now they come in and you don't get to keep 100% of your wins either.

Thats what people meant when they say yeah they can work harder to get that promotion only to move up in the tax bracket to be rewarded with a bigger portions of your earning being taken.

"Correct. That is a non-fungible blockchain commodity. That is not a crypto currency. 

You understand what fungible means right? My only point, was that if a currency was not fungible, that by definition makes it centralized. 

So of course, with cryptocurrencies being decentralized, they HAVE to be fungible. With fungibility being the only definition of commodities, any decentralized currency, crypto or not, is a commodity. There is an overlap there. 

You correctly pointed out they are by definition commodities, my point is that it is soley because of decentralization. 

The only other currency that has ever been also directly considered a commodity, were precious metals which have other utility. Some places (like google) define commodity as:

That ""Woulda had $200k"" came from an $11k buy-in, back at the $1,150 peak bubble. (Yeah I bought in right at the top of a bubble, like an idiot. If I had waited a couple months then it ""woulda been $400k."")

That's reasonable. I think people do this calculation all the time. There are opportunities for extra money in many cases but people value their own time over working extra if they don't need it. Moving into a higher marginal tax bracket might change the calculus a bit too. However, you would have to be on the edge of a tax bracket for it to matter. Even then the rate of tax increases modestly between brackets so in the worst case scenario it changes the calculus marginally. In the largest tax bracket change you earn ~88% of what you earn in the lower tax bracket. Every other bracket change still results in better than ~93%.;1;0;False;PatSays;dsbmkl6;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"It's actually deeper and much cooler than that: the fee goes to the miners.

Who are the miners? They're the ones powering the system.

How do they power it? It's a worldwide distributed random lottery. The more computing resources you pour into it, the higher the shot of hitting the 15BTC jackpot per block. You know how it's a blockchain? That's because when someone hits the jackpot, another block gets added to the chain.

You can read about it in detail here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf but don't worry if most of it seems opaque. Lots of smart people pored over this and found few flaws. Satoshi had to drag us kicking and screaming here.

Anyway, the fees go to the miners because each block can only hold a certain number of transactions. That limit was reached. Meaning those who pay more, get to be in the next block. So you can choose to pay $0.05 instead, but your tx will never get incorporated into a block because everyone else is paying more.

Why not make the blocks bigger? That is a divisive topic in these circles, but two reasons:

1. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a currency. It's a store of wealth. (Ignore the ""cash"" aspect of the paper and pay attention to everything else. The current situation is outlined in 6.2, trade fees.) For lightweight transactions, use other cryptos.

2. Raising the block size would be bad news for BTC long term. You have to store the entire blockchain to participate. It's already gigabytes. If you 2x the block size, that will grow it 2x as quickly. And then we'll hit the limit anyway and be right back in the same damn situation.

BTC was designed to operate this way, and it's still going strong. And it will succeed if people just *don't change it* and let it be rock solid. Satoshi planned for this.

"My point is never about making less overall.

That'd be like saying once you reach a threshold you get 100% of your income taxed, so you take home $0.  But before you reach that you only get taxed 99%.  That would have been a ridiculous system.

I'm talking about calculating the trade off between your ""life force/time"" vs the money you make minus the amount that will get taxed on a progressive manner.

Imagine your job is hurling 20 tons of brick every day for 1X amount of money, and in order for you to make more money, your boss agreed to pay you 2X if you move 40 tons a day.  That's fair right?  Yet for twice the amount of bricks you have to put on your back, you will still only be able to take home 1.85X due to tax.  Sure it's still more than 1X, you're ""better off"" with that extra money that you can spend on stuff you enjoy.

But keep in mind you exchanged for it with twice the work/strain on your body/limited amount of time in your life.  But hey if that's worth it for you (sometimes it's out of necessity) then you won't see me fighting you over what you want to do with your life/time.  

But of course in my example, it could very well be that your equivalent job only have to move 21 tons a day and make 1.75X money.  Depends on the job/promotion so people can make their own calculation whether it's worth it or not.

First the limit is 21 million. Second mining is the solving of a mathmaticaly hard problem to verify a block, a block is a group of transactions linked to the previous block for a block to be accepted the miners must find a number which when put into a function with the block it gives a value below the current difficulty* because this problem is hard miners pick random numbers and check if it makes the block valid if it does they broadcast the new valid block to the network, in return they get a reward, new bitcoins. Third the limit is enforced by the colective if a miner trys to gI've himself more bitcoins all the nodes notice that, the reward value is wrong and they drop the block and the miner has wasted time and money to try that so he lost money so he won't do that in the first place.;4;0;False;Alonzo-Coeus;dsbe5zx;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
"* The 21 million limit is imposed by the software. The software only recognizes transactions that follow specified rules. If anyone modifies the software to violate the rules their transactions will be ignored. The core devs could make the change but then the rest of the network would probably just fork the code, roll back the change, and essentially ignore the devs from that point on and replace them. Nobody really wants the number to go up.

* Mining is the process of solving a *very very hard* cryptographic puzzle (randomly generating hashes until one with a specified number of leading zeros is generated) for the purpose of securing transactions. Miners are the systems that validate transactions, so when you submit a transaction to the network the miners put it into the next block that will be added to the blockchain. When they solve the puzzle they get the rights to ""seal"" the block and broadcast it out to the rest of the network. All user nodes receive the new block containing all the new valid transactions (maybe 1000 tx per block) and they add it to their copy of the blockchain. The way the system is written, user nodes will reject any block that isn't properly signed by a mining node that won the cryptographic race. This puzzle is what allows the entire network to agree on a single copy of the ledger.

"Intrinsic value is a pretty dated concept in economic theory. The problem is that value is never universal (maybe you think apples have intrinsic value, but if I'm allergic to apples I wouldn't pay you even 1 cent per kilo (other than to sell them to someone else who values them more)), and if you try to make it universal you'll end up at nonsense like ""how much labour does it take to produce"", which doesn't work on many levels.

Subjective value, on the other hand, actually works great as the foundation for better economic models based on people's individual behaviour. And it doesn't have trouble explaining the valuation of non-physical things like Bitcoin, because plenty of people are obviously stoked for it.

The difference between OT and digital currency is you earn OT.  Capital gains will be taxed HEAVY because its investing - not labor.  Also, when you transfer in and out of the non-alt coin's you will be taxed on the gains of all outside trades & and the gains off the BTC (example).  So by the end of it, you will have already likely spent the money, or have it held up in some other crypto, which you will then need to withdraw - take another tax on - and continue the viscous cycle.

Someone, please help I really have no clue whats going on and how this whole thing works. Call me stupid and dumb for putting in all that money I know I screwed up. But please just help me figure out whats going on. Anyone have experience with this website before?!

I like all the salty people coming here asking dumb questions about bubbles and value and what can bitcoin do that money cant, blah blah blah. PSA: Do you really think we are going to spend time convincing a total stranger of the value of this new technology and its use cases when you are too lazy to do any basic research yourself so that you can reap the rewards later the same as those who put in the time to understand this? This goes for everyone who posts like this on here or comes from r/all looking to defend what they gullibly get fed on mainstream media. ;-1;0;False;southofearth;dsbb1yc;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"Copied from the Internet:""•	You are not really investing, you are mostly gambling. Some of these companies will likely fail to deliver a product. Maybe they never even intended to produce one.
•	Do not rush.
•	Don't be greedy.
•	Do not ask: ""What is the best ICO at the moment"". Or do it if you want to create a potential non-investment list. Do your homework first.
•	Be a ""sane paranoïd"". People are not always what they pretend to be and scammers are gifted to seduce.
•	Due diligence is the key. You cannot just rely on other people comments, thoughts or so called ""analysis"". The interests of others are not necessarily yours.
•	Invest only what you can afford to lose.
•	Invest in something you do understand. You have to deep dive into the product: who, what, when, how? What about technology, team, market, viability, roadmap, token, supply, market cap, distribution, incentives, etc.
•	Does the product really need to be based on blockchain technology?
•	Is there a market?
•	Ask for informations. Ask again. And again. Exemple.
•	Do they have a product, github, etc?
•	What about the token? Necessary? Useful? What's the use? What about the incentives to use, hold or sell it? Is there a way to sell it?
•	Access to ICO smart contract's code before the ICO? Audited? Terms of ICO / Presale? Website audited?
•	As a token holder, what do you gain?
•	In your country, what are the legal and tax implications as a token buyer/holder/seller?
•	Think about it for a minute: the company is successful and Google buy it. What happens to your investment?
•	There is no free money. If the project sounds too good to be true, just go back to ""sane paranoïd"" mode and take a closer look.
•	Check accounts on reddit (history, karma, redditor since, write to who and in which subreddits).
•	Caution with pyramid / ponzi schemes. How to spot them? 1) Most of the time, guaranteed return on investment. 2) Aberrant interest rates (no one can give you 1% daily, nor 10% monthly. I know you would like it, but be realistic).
•	A lot of ICO rating/due diligence services, forums and websites are in a potential conflict of interests. If the service accept donation: caution. If a company has to pay to be rated or is encouraged to make a donation to expedite the procedure: caution. If the service shill the iCO: caution. If the rating service is also acting as an exchange, intermediary, consultant: caution. Just four examples: IcoBazaar.com, Icodrops.com, Icobench.com and even r/icocrypto which accept donation to support moderation.
•	Spread the awarness.

BTC was not made to be traded, it was made to be a form of currency. It’s only value is what people are willing to pay for it, like supply and demand. It is almost treated like a stock, if the price goes down, everyone will be fighting to get out, and options trading will force the value down fast, like shorting the BTC.

"This has been the best way to go about it. If someone is actually interested in doing this then I tell them to setup a bittrex/binance account and I send them $50 in whatever my short term alts are along with the sell targets for them. And we setup their blockfolio account. This teaches them that one day they'll be up 15% and another they'll be down 40%. But a week later they're up 200%. We practice placing orders and stop losses. 

I show them charts so they can understand the basics of TA (flags, wedges, all that shit). I show them a calendar site so they can see what news is coming down the way for what coin. I show them how to use explorers. I tell them that when bitcoin pumps weak alts bleed out. Show them how to set alarms. I show them my top 5 favorite youtube crypto channels. Who to follow on twitter and telegram.

It's kinda fun to see them research and find their own coins and make their own moves. It gives them an appreciation for how this thing works and what it takes.

Some people offer to give me their money and ask me to trade it for them, but that kinda sucks the fun out of this. I don't want to be responsible for someone elses money. Can't effectively trade under stress like that. Need to be comfy during dips. If I had to cut losses every time a price dropped 10% then their holdings would dwindle down to nothing.

">  I cannot believe people were taking out second mortgages to buy BTC in 2017.

Every time asks me about BTC I try to include the example of morons taking out second mortgages but buy in and make clear the person understands that even if bitcoin skyrockets and you turn your $250,000 loan into $100,000,000 they'd be complete morons. 

Likewise I also make sure they understand that invest and later sell for a nice profit they should not be hard on themselves if they could have made more money. As in ""oh no I turned $1,000 into $5,000 when I really wasn't comfortable with risking losing all of it at that point, but if I'd held on 2 more years I could have had $500,000"" and then launching into a spiral of depression that potentially results in suicide.

"The best advice is just HOLD.  There have been many days where my limit orders have magically hit the low for the buy side and hit the high for the sell. You feel like a genius. But it's also taken a ton of time, mental anguish, staring and refreshing.  Sad part is I've missed some very big run up as even when I pick a high sell limit much higher than the current going exchange rate.  It fills and keeps going much higher.  When I've re entered I've lost fees, exchange fees, and of course a high price etc. I've ended up with definitely less BTC or some alt coins than I should have.  

I do have to say one piece of advice as I exit some coins and buy some others is set a low, low limit exchange ratio price when buying.  Sure you miss out on some buys but they almost always fill because of some flash crash, unsteady hands, fud etc.  

Don't keep changing your limit order buy price higher as those .0001 higher price add up especially when buying the cheapo alt coins, you can sometimes get 50000 more coins but just setting a low limit buy price and not worrying about it.

I can’t do it. I’m diversified. In an untested industry like this I did not put anything more into it than I could afford to lose.

"I thought another large advantage of Bitcoin was that the transactions were free? Would transaction fees go away after we've hit that critical-point where miners abandon mining? 

It seems everything I have read is wrong and its really making me reconsider. What advantage IS there then? Anonymous transactions and secure transactions. That's about it. Sure maybe Bitcoin has the potential for zero or very little inflation but but it's so volatile that I don't think that's something of importance at this point. Maybe if it stabilizes but as long as new cryptos come out, the market will probably be volatile. 

From my point of view, one thing that Bitcoin has going for it is acceptance by business's as a currency. Maybe in some areas other cryotos are accepted but I only ever see Bitcoin signs. I think that would have an impact on public perception of it as a real currency and not just an investment. I think that will allow it to stabilize. Other cryptos will still exist but mainly as investments which will keep them volatile. This is all just my hypothesis, I guess you could call it.

"*See edits: this story is currently unverified. This comment will be updated one way or another.*

Since nobody read the article, it's pretty fuddy. Here's an important detail:

>Microsoft does not allow users to buy products with Bitcoin directly but **asks users to add a predetermined amount of dollars to their account balance, for which they can pay with Bitcoin**.

~~So the headline is completely false. Microsoft is making a temporary move to allow users to load their account balance with Bitcoin rather than making direct individual purchases. Essentially users are buying non-refundable ""Microsoft Bucks"" with Bitcoin, and I think this is a very reasonable move considering the circumstances, and one that Steam should take as well. [Thanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7osicy/microsoft_still_accepts_bitcoin_payments_shills/) to /u/entrepreneuby for pointing out this detail.~~ 

For what it's worth, I think it's clear that small retail payments don't make economic sense for Bitcoin right now. Bitcoin and various Bitcoin companies are facing the luxury problem of being in very high demand. Luckily there are plenty of people working to address these problem. You all know about [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ojkoz/lightning_network_megathread/) which is progressing constantly, and we will also see the [Rootstock \(RSK\)](http://rsk.co/) federated sidechain platform launch soon as well, both very exciting!

**EDIT:** Still researching this since the article is such poorly written clickbait. Let's get this verified one way or the other. The article author seems to have spoken with [MS support staff via chat](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/949979522635616256). 

**EDIT 2:** Still trying to verify this. At least one person has told me that Bitcoin is not available as a payment option when trying to buy a 1 year xbox live subscription. I've asked [@csuwildcat](https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/950107454628552704) (Head of Decentralized Identity at Microsoft) to clarify and he's currently unaware of any changes but is looking into it. Changing the topic's flair from 'misleading' to 'unverified' until we have a conclusion. 

**EDIT 3:** /u/cryptochangements34 does [not see](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7or2i6/microsoft_joins_steam_and_stops_accepting_bitcoin/dsc4k3o/?context=3) the Bitcoin payment option. Neither does /u/FraggleRockRefugee. This indicates that the story, while very poorly written, may indeed be true.

**EDIT 4:** More reports of the lack of a Bitcoin payment option on the Microsoft site. It's worth noting that [something similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3q248i/microsoft_no_longer_accepts_bitcoin_for_adding/) happened in [2016](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/14/microsoft-stops-accepting-bitcoin-on-windows-10.html). 

**Edit 5:** I've seen enough anecdotal claims that personally I'm convinced that Microsoft has indeed ceased accepting Bitcoin as payment. *Maybe* they goofed up again, but I doubt it. Can't say I blame them, although this is the sort of thing that should come from an official source rather than a tabloid site.

It's not a problem, it's a fundamental tradeoff. More decentralization means more communication overhead. Current networking and computing make decentralized networks possible on a global scale, but only up to a point. Even if technology gets better, local consensus will still be faster. But it's like nation states, you can have a few large organisations exchange value and within those global organizations there can be local consensus, secured by the larger global consensus. ;2;0;False;alsomahler;dsc58uc;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

It makes sense to optimize transactions before committing to bigger blocks. If all transactions went through SegWit right now, everything would be fine while we wait for payment processors using Lightning Network to arrive. The only issue is that wallet apps and exchanges aren't implementing SegWit quickly enough. I don't doubt that blocks will become bigger in the future, that will always remain an option. Right now, we need to name and shame the companies that refuse to implement SegWit. Ideally, we should use their competitors, but it isn't easy to abandon a product you've been using for years and trust for a smaller competitor that doesn't have the same track record.;1;1;False;Exotemporal;dsbwamx;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

"Stocks actually serve a purpose. In an Initial Public Offering, the public is given a chance to own part of the company and the company receives capital to grow its size. The stock market efficiently values companies based on supply and demand. Poorly run companies lose value. Well run companies increase in value and potentially return dividends to shareholders if the company makes more than it needs to invest in its future. Having a stock market where the general public can invest and participate is far preferable to businesses that are all private and opaque. Many years ago, the government required publicly traded companies to update its shareholders on the status of the business every 90 days, known as quarterly reports. This goes along way to keeping companies honest. Information is now widely available, resulting in a much more transparent market. Does it have problems? Of course, but in aggregate the stock market works well.

Wrong. Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bcash. Bitcoin Core is the name of the software. The currency is called Bitcoin.;2;1;False;Kalin101;dsby9xt;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/
"Bitcoin didn't split. Bitcoin Cash forked away from Bitcoin. There have been other forks before and there have been and will be other forks after the Bitcoin Cash fork. Most of these forks are failures though.

Bitcoin Core is a piece of software that works on the Bitcoin protocol, but there are other teams building other pieces of software. The team behind Bitcoin Core just happens to be the most active and competent team, so a majority of users choose their software. Any competent programmer can contribute to Bitcoin's development.

The only reason why Bitcoin transactions are expensive right now is because of Bitcoin's overwhelming success and because of spam transactions. SegWit addresses this directly. If all wallet apps and exchanges offered SegWit, the transactions would be affordable again while we wait for second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.

Bitcoin Cash's only advantages is that it allows for bigger blocks and that its user base is much smaller than Bitcoin's, making Bitcoin Cash transactions much cheaper at the moment.

Bitcoin could kill Bitcoin Cash overnight by allowing miners to mine bigger blocks. They don't do it because it isn't a sustainable scaling solution. You evidently don't want everyone's morning coffee to be recorded in perpetuity on thousands of computers, it's a completely unreasonable waste of resources. If Bitcoin Cash became successful and was adopted widely for everyday transaction, its blocks would have to become huge, which would inevitably lead to dangerous centralization.

The team behind the Bitcoin Core software chose a much more reasonable route. With SegWit, they reduced the size of Bitcoin transactions so that more transactions can be crammed into each block. Implementing Schnorr signatures will result in another large efficiency gain. Then there's the Lightning Network that will allow users to make instantaneous and very cheap transactions.

These three technologies will make Bitcoin much more efficient and scalable than Bitcoin Cash. Most transactions should become SegWit transaction once SegWit is implemented by all wallet apps and exchanges. Many of them are dragging their feet for political reasons, but it should happen in the coming months. Many highly competent developers are working on Schnorr signatures and the Lightning Network. We should have them in 2018.";5;1;False;Exotemporal;dsbyrom;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

"Agreed, but it has a community that still rallies very strongly behind the main dev team, which takes relatively substantial risks (in terms of drastic changes to the software) compared to bitcoin development. They've proposed numerous hard forks, and so long as they'd had good reasons and explained things well, the community just went along with it. This is what bitcoin would have if Satoshi were still around, but it certainly comes with drawbacks. A dev team that has a personality cult surrounding it is a point of centralization and possible failure. Still, I've got half of my holdings in Eth mainly because they're making an effort to innovate when it comes to solving the blockchain's scaling issue.

"What trends are you referring to? People won't leave because Bitcoin _IS_ the superior tech. 

This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed, if they are centralized. Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company. Anything about $IOTA can be changed by IOTA Foundation. None of their properties, whatever they may be, are real. They are not rigid, because they do not rest on a decentralized foundation. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who do not value decentralization above all are a misled bunch. None of the properties they value about a certain coin matter, if they do not first cement them in decentralization.

Reminder: You can build something anywhere on the spectrum of decentralized-centralized on a foundation that is decentralized. You can only build centralized on top of a foundation that is centralized.

Give me one altcoin that is better than Bitcoin on just one of these 3 ( Decentralization,Security and Speed of Transactions) but still doesn't compromise on the other 2. Bitcoin is the most balanced—that's what matters.

 Alts are not long for this world. They only exist because they have a lie about their utility. Lightning will help a lot, sidechains too, and the great awakening of ‘17 will accelerated the burn of dumb money (Removing the altcoin fuel). I’d give them 5 years to near zero.

"I live in the US. I pay $50/month for internet, which is pretty standard. I have a 1/TB month bandwidth cap. As a fraction of the my total cap, that 60GB/month would cost $3. My ISP, which is a total ripoff, charges $10 for each 50GB over the 1TB, so if I were paying at that exorbitant rate, it would cost $12 for the extra bandwidth.

In most cases, that 60GB/month wont actually cost the user anything directly, because it will be under there pre-paid allotment. A two hour Netfilx movie is 6GB, and people watch lots and lots of movies without paying 'extra' for bandwidth.

"I agree that Core has a lot of influence on such things because a lot of people just tend to follow Core. I am just saying that this is problematic. 

Open Source projects tend to fork if people disagree on the vision and the roadmap.

In the case of Bitcoin, many people have attempting forking to raise the block size. The leftovers in the main project stand behind the vision of small blocks, and currently [pulling out the champagne](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html) for how well their fee market is working. They aren't going to raise the limit. Open Source projects always generate meritocratic bubbles.

"> Its rather disturbing the companies especially would rather waste this resource and pass on costs to their customers while having no problem raking in mega profits from their fees. 

That's the world we live in and unfortunately many people do not want to see this.
Segwit is a scaling solution and it's here. People can use it, but there are many reasons as to why it is not getting adopted as quickly as many people hope.
Realistically we can be happy if we have 50% segwit adoption in let's say 6-8 month but this will not really help us in any way with the network congestion we have now.
As soon as fees go down, many people will start to do transactions that they are not doing now due to high fees and then we're back where we started.

In my opinion the only solution would be to push for further Segwit adoption AND increase the block size to at least 2MB, maybe even 4MB.
That should then solve the issue we have until LN will be fully available hopefully around mid 2019.
Since Core and many other people are too political about this topic, it will most likely not happen, so we are basically fucked for the next 18 month which will result in Bitcoin further loosing it's market dominance which is a pitty.

People would use SegWit if all wallet apps and exchanges supported it. Wallets apps and exchanges have been slow to adopt SegWit, that's where the issue lies. When your wallet app gives you a SegWit address and makes SegWit transactions by default and when exchanges offer cheaper fees if you send your bitcoins to a SegWit address, usage will skyrocket.

"Let me chime in with a little more tact :)

Microsoft wasn't actually ""accepting"" Bitcoin but merely converting it immediately to fiat anyways during the sale. Microsoft doesn't hold Bitcoin so this doesn't equate to a sell-off of any kind. This isn't a coin liquidation - nothing to impact the price in that regard.

More importantly, people don't buy Bitcoin so they can shop at Microsoft. A few folks may have, but if any sales were happening, the user most likely already held BTC by their own choice - not just because Microsoft started accepting it as payment. 

If anyone did hold BTC strictly because of Microsoft, well, you now see how few because the price hasn't changed. That's how few people really cared about Microsoft's involvement.

The only time Bitcoin's price fluctuates is when users buy or sell it directly. Before Microsoft was Steam. Before Steam was Overstock.com and TigerDirect.com. Many tech stores have started and stopped accepting BTC but the price keeps going up over the years. And I actually think you can still use Bitcoin at TigerDirect sooo. . . that kind of negates Microsoft anyways. You can still buy a SurfacePro or a copy of Windows10 with BTC. . .

"If you look at reality, then you will see that this is simply not happening!
Coinbase is not implementing Segwit and many others are also not doing it.
So discussing what WOULD be if all would adopt segwit today is completely useless, because it's obviously not happening for a multitude of reasons.

The second point in which you are wrong is that you say blocks would be half full by morning.
Under this assumption you believe that the transactions that are currently being done are the ONLY transactions people want to do which is totally wrong.
The transactions that are currently processed are the ones people STILL want/need to do even if they have to pay $30 in fees for it.
How many businesses have already stopped using Bitcoins, because of the high fees!
How many people have switched to alt coins due to that!

If Segwit would be adopted completely tonight, then yes, the blocks would be half empty tomorrow, but they would be full again in a week from now.
Of course fees would not be at $30 anyore, but they would be at let's say $5 and with massive amounts of new users coming in, they would be at $10 again at few weeks later.

So no, even full Segwit adoption will NOT solve the fee issue in my opinion, because even $10 fees are far too high and we need more than that.

A 2MB block size increase PLUS widespread Segwit adoption may safe us till LN is fully available. Better in my opinion would be a 4MB increase plus continous Segwit adoption of course. That way we should be pretty much fine until LN is fully operational and in addition we'd see a large increase in price as well. 

> Do you think coordinating a hard fork is somehow easier. 

I never said it would be easy, but certainly doable in my opinion.
At least better than to continue loosing market share on a daily basis and forcing Bitcoin users to pay millions of dollars in fees every day to miners.
We recently had a block where the amount of fees was higher than the block reward. Do you honestly think this is an acceptable situation?

Just saying adopt Segwit, what's so hard about that, is unacceptable in my opinion.

I agree 100%. Putting all of their eggs in one basket is and should be considered a big no-no for BTC. I think their ego is in the way of increasing the blocksize now. Just look at Luke Dashjr's twitter. He actually argues for shrinking the blocksize;112;2;False;lawmaster99;dsbqtkp;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/
"It's very strange to wait for ""them"" to fix anything. There is no ""they"". There is no authority to increase the block size.

The nature of Bitcoin is that *anybody* can change the rules by releasing software. This can result in either:

1. Nobody uses the new rules. This happens if you would for instance increase the supply.
2. Everybody uses the new rules. This would be a ""clean upgrade"" happens if you would for instance fix a bug.
3. Some people use the new rules. This results in a chain split and will eventually allow the market to decide.

Although a block size should have been a type 2 upgrade, it was a type 3 upgrade, due the persistently believed fallacy that small blocks somehow aid decentralization.

I don't see how it makes sense to increase the blocksize *again*, especially since big block advocates are now on that chain, so are even in a smaller minority for the main chain than before August 1.";25;3;False;tomtomtom7;dsbtmyv;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

">Just my thoughts.

Number one, nobody was buying anything from Microsoft using bitcoin, anyway... this was just a marketing ploy to begin with. 

But have you thought about the fact that Core developers are thoughtfully, purposefully designing systems that ready Bitcoin for 2nd layer functions (such as Lightning Network) that making Bitcoin useful and even preferable for retail transactions?

On chain transactions for retail just aren't there yet and this much is obvious, because they bloat the blockchain and require measures of centralization (increased bandwidth usage and storage) to solve- eg bcash. What is telling to me is how the Bitcoin developer community is not in a rush to action to solve the problem with quick bandaids and panicked solutions that sacrifice Bitcoin's core tenets of immutability and censorship resistance. They understand that these facets must be preserved at all costs for Bitcoin to maintain it's purpose. 

2nd and 3rd layer solutions are the way to attack this ""retail adoption"" meme, which, in my view, is just that, as most people really have no pressing urge to spend bitcoins for coffee and so forth, because right now, the system is much better purposed for other uses, such as storing value outside the legacy financial system. 

Only much later, when Bitcoin has become more ubiquitous, will actual mainstream adoption drive demand for retail solutions for joe schmoe millenial lemming consumer. Meanwhile, Core developers will have had taken their time designing processes such as Segwit, that lay the groundwork for this, and will be perfectly positioned to leverage them. 

Case in point, [watch Roger Ver try to sell bitcoin retail adoption to an average joe Schmoe grocery store owner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBv3GgiG_ro) in, ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"" documentary. It's a joke. Roger is earnest and well-intentioned, but the idea is just a joke to the guy, who really has no interest in exposing himself to a payment system that is not driven by innate demand from the people. It works fine for Roger, but it isn't ready for most others. Only Roger would sell bitcoin to some grocer using a bitcoin wallet (Blockchain.info) whose main graphic is a damned Rubick's Cube (at the time). As if Bitcoin wasn't puzzling enough to the avg consumer already, heh.

You guys acting like this is bad for the price when it's probably good. Microsoft probably didn't keep any of the BTC spent on their website, they exchanged it into USD which would slowly drive the price down if lots of us spent BTC there. BTC being a store of value is best case for it going up in value. LN will kinda change that but the good thing about LN is if they want to withdraw the funds they will need to pay a fee so it maybe best to just keep it.;-2;0;False;BeastMiners;dsbreu4;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

So the situation for merchants and payment processors is MUCH WORSE than people think. They pay fuckton of money to accept BTC.

"While transaction fees do need to be reduced, I think the  panic is unwarranted. As is the claim that if Bitcoin can't be used for coffee purchases, it will immediately be replaced by something else. That whole line of thinking seems dangerously flawed. 

The only way that would happen, is if all the new adopters of Bitcoin and crypto were actually trying to use it to buy coffee. The truth is I believe the people using crypto for small and frequent transfers of that type are simply a vocal minority. Buying coffee is not the killer app, even if it were magically free to do. Price volatility and confirmation times makes it absurd to think small retail transactions will be the main use case driving growth. This is an old idea a lot of Bitcoiners seem to be having trouble letting go of. 

Bitcoin can and will be money with solutions like LN in the long term which get at the root of the problem in scalable way. It's absolutely essential to its long term success. But let's not pretend there's a wave of people rushing into crypto so that they can buy mocha frappacinos and will switch to even smaller and more volatile coins to facilitate that if Bitcoin can't do so today. That's patently absurd. 

Before we freak out over a big brand name dropping Bitcoin payments let's first ask ourselves a couple of things. How much was microsoft ever really receiving in terms of bitcoin payments, even when fees were cheap?  And do we really think them doing so an immediately converting to fiat was ever really going to drive adoption? We're people really throwing their money into Bitcoin and learning a whole new system and technology to do something with it they could already much more easily and reliably do with traditional payment methods?

">I'm well aware of a 51% attack. And I'm also well aware of how it's impossible to even do so. And I'm also well aware of how it's impossible to even do so.

40% of hashing power has already been in the hands of a single mining group before.

You think 40% is possible but 51% is beyond the realms of possibility?

Economies of scale make further concentration of hashing power more likely, not less. All you're hoping for is that no mining group ever does get 51% of hashing power, and if it does, that its more profitable for them to not abuse their power than to abuse it.

"> Gold comes from super novas

Nuclear fusion occurs in super novas. Nuclear fusion is when two smaller atoms fuse together to create a bigger atom. That's how you produce elements like gold from smaller elements.

You can also do nuclear fusion outside of super novas its just really expensive which is why no one can cheaply create more gold than already exists on earth.

Where do you think people store things in cities? Warehouses, storage units, garages.

If you think everything but food is going to be worthless why would you want to even live in a city? Cities don't grow enough food to feed themselves, and if nothing else is worth trading then everyone in cities will starve to death and kill each other for the last remaining food pretty quickly. 

>Gold and silver won't be worth shit either because why am I trading food for a hunk of metal? 

Metals have been more valuable than food since the Copper Age, yet somehow breaking cryptography will make all metals worthless? So we'll be back in the stone age?

If you could just buy up dollars and then sell them on for 20x more a year later, there's an obvious reason people would stop using dollars to trade.";1;0;False;suninabox;dsanrvu;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg

it's not a question of who will want to, but who will *actually* have 200k to drop on a coin?

">I'd rather have my money in a system that isn't hackable and can never be taken from me

Keeping your money in a publicly accessible blockchain does not make it unhackable.

Google how the 51% attack works, and how quantum computing can break the cryptography that bitcoin is based on.

also assuming you ever get or put your bitcoin on an internet connected computer then its hackable.

If you want something unhackable bury gold somewhere no one knows.

>This argument is becoming weaker and weaker with the amount of adoption and new layered technologies being rolled out. Bitcoin has literally become the internet of money

Look at how many of the top 500 US retailers accepted bitcoin in 2014, now look to day, and tell me adoption is increasing, not decreasing.";1;1;False;suninabox;dsan0xm;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg
Thanks for teaching me your infinite wisdom Mr I know everything about everything. What you just claimed is the complete opposite of what you actually are. Lol. All you did was correct me about some wild ass future that is so far fetched and complete unrealistic. Lol I bet you're fun at parties. Enjoy you you're time on this sub teaching others because clearly we are inferior to your infinite wisdom. You're probably the 2nd biggest tool I've come accross on this sub.
