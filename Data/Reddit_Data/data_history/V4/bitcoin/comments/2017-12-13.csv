"[Bubble?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2p6vzc/this_is_probably_the_most_accurate_price/)

If there is a bubble, it doesn't work the way you think it does and it's not popping until we see some massive figures. This is like buying a house in 2007 way under market value and being prepared for the crash because you can see it coming. buying now isn't a bad investment if you have a good exit strategy, which means you're either prepared to sell before the local optima that immediately comes before the ath and crash, or you're ready to transition to profitable altcoins around that same time. Either way, there's at least 1 year of growth available here that you won't find literally any place else. If you want to think about investment wisdom when it comes to this, ask yourself what the people with real money were doing during the housing crisis, not the chumps.

"You don't know what an analogy is, nor do you understand what the guy's main concern was. Fiat currency is an inflationary asset. There's an incentive in spending it now rather than later. Bitcoins are a deflationary asset. People aren't going to be incentivised to spend BTC now if they think its gonna quadruple in value in the next month. It has to stabilize somehow before it can be used as a currency. Right now, what gives bitcoin value other than the people who are willing to pay for it? And why would they (the people who are looking for quick returns), keep their money in BTC once the returns get stale? It has no government guarantee, nor is it tied to a physical asset with industrial value. You're vastly underestimating how few people with a skin in the game believe or even understand the underlying technological marvel. I don't expect the majority to weather the harsh dips/crashes and come out the other side.

I love bitcoin and blockchain and have put money in various blockchain projects, but don't fool yourself and others with this blind cult worship. Bitcoin has it's kinks.

If you play the slots you have no control other than whether to pull or not.

"It is unfortunately neither. For reference, all currently accepted currencies normally share the traits of government issued, circulated in economies, and price-regulated. Granted almost no 1st world currency balances itself on the gold standard anymore (USA stopped in 1973) but they're still regulating these currencies by purchasing other currencies and selling their own to balance inflation/deflation. 

Noticeably, bitcoin does not do that. Bitcoin is definitely a stock, not a currency, due to its inability to be used as a currency. I get that they're trying to solve this but there's a few things that's going to harm their attempts now rather than if they attempted this 1.5 years ago. The biggest issue with bitcoin as a stock is it doesn't actually back a company. If you invest in Microsoft, you're actually helping further their productivity in a way. 

What does bitcoin as a product gain from your investment? As far as I know, well... nothing but your money. They can't improve their currency outside of it's value, they can't produce a new, better product, they're... an idea. Bitcoin is at the end of the day nothing more than an idea that we have accepted as a currency. 

Now with Bitcoin's rapid rate of growth and WallStreet's entering, the writing might as well be on the wall: This bubble is going to burst eventually. Now is decidedly too late to invest in bitcoin. If you haven't invested, don't touch it. There's too much risk and those guys who have been here since the beginning just don't have to face that risk because they bought their shares for pennies on the dollar. My broker always tells me that the bubble will come down to at least where the price was before a 45% increase per annum occurred. I don't know where that lands bitcoin but 1500% in 36 months suggests way closer to a 14k loss (where they were in JANUARY OF THIS YEAR).

A global deregulated currency is needed. It may or may not be bitcoin depending on if they can improve transaction speed/cost to match how many people are adopting it.

"It isn't exclusive to bitcoin, that's the point.  It's about speculative investors and it's called the ""bigger fool fallacy"". It's been around forever.

One difference between bitcoin and MOST of the stock market, however;

Bitcoin is purely speculation, while a stock can be an investment OR speculation.

People investing in stock own a portion of a company's assets, and often are receiving dividends based on the company's performance in an actual activity.   General Motors produces autos, sells them at a profit, reports their profits, and pays a dividend to shareholders.   People want to own the right to those dividends, so they buy the stock and drive its price up.  Some are speculating with intent to sell for a return on equity.
some are looking to the dividends as the primary form of return, this is often less lucrative, but much less risky.

Bitcoin has no underlying asset or promise.    It is not a stock, but a currency.   It doesn't promise a dividend or an interest payment.  The only way an investor can profit is by speculating that if they buy today, the price will be higher when they sell it.   

Don't get me wrong, stocks and even commodities can be purely speculative as well, but a smart investor generally avoids pure speculation, and looks at underlying assets and profitablility.

Some non-crypto currency scenarios that this sentence clearly apply to include the South Sea Bubble, the Tulip Trade, the modern Bullion trade, and penny-stocks sold in the market today.";1;1;False;Tinnitus_AngleSmith;dr792wr;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg
"The stock market, while driven by human emotions, is backed by business fundamentals; bitcoin is backed by the premise that it's able to effectively replace currency (false due to poor scalability causing high transaction fees) without relying on a central banking organization.

They're both investing into concepts, but one is based on the success of a business (stocks) while the other is based on the (semi-)widespread adoption of a currency backed by no entities, or more specifically, whose value is completely dictated by the market with no fundamental value driving its price.


A company can be over- or under-valued based on its fundamental operations; BTC is worth exactly as much as someone is willing to pay for it, and the price today in no way reflects what the price will be in a day, week, month, year, etc. The same issue exists with government-issued fiats but those are backed by the government themself; BTC has no such risk mitigation.

tl;dr they're basically the same with the caveat that BTC is a shell whereas stocks represent something that actually generates (or not, based on the company's fundamentals) wealth.";2;0;False;thrway1312;dr78bd4;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

Not using it properly, (like the majority), results in hacks and theft. I don't ""store"" money in the bank for an investment. It's because it's fdic insured and safer than having cash in a safe. There are plenty who rather hide it in a mattress.
Learning how to manage a wallet and use cold storage isn't easier than the current banking system. And as of now, it's not even cheaper with the higher transaction fees.

Most of the world needs their money to pay for rent, buy food, clothes, and other necessities. The average person who does invest puts some money away in a 401k and doesn't worry about investing or checking their bitcoin price everyday. 

Your numbers for 100 million users or percentage of total population is out of tune with reality. 

Bitcoin is worth whatever it's users and adopters want it to be right now. Such as fine art and jewery, rare commodities, collectibles, etc.

But unless it can be used to buy things in the real world, using percentage of a world population is just a bogus stat.

Yes? I think you missed my point, which was that people are buying into BC right now when the actual value is less than what they are paying for it which will precipitate a crash. Yes, like the stock market, which is much more comparable to cryptos than currency, and yes like the housing market/car market. The trouble is that nobody is actually sure what the value of BC is. This makes it much harder to predict when the crash will happen. Bitcoin has crashed before and it was rough on people who bought at the peak.

"You can't carry your cash on your person completely securely though. Large sums take a lot of space. Cops or border agents can seize it, so it's going to have to stay in your country and ideally in your house. Assuming that you can hide it well enough that you'll never have to worry about theft or confiscation, which is a stretch, it could still get destroyed by fire, water or rodents. Then there's the fact that many countries forbid cash purchases above a certain amount, which can be quite low. Also, I'm only 34 and live in a rich Western country, yet I've seen my country's bank notes become obsolete 3 times.

Using bitcoin securely is super easy with deterministic wallets (wallet apps and hardware wallets) that provide you with a 12+-word seed. This level of security is completely sufficient. If you delete the wallet and memorize the seed, no one can know that you own bitcoins and no one can force you to make a transaction. Hardware wallets are foolproof and hack-proof and if you're dealing with a large sum, that's what you're going to use. Reasonably careful people don't have viruses on their phones. With time, securing your bitcoins is getting increasingly easier.

A physical deterministic cold wallet generator with its own screen and open source code could be made for $5 and it would be completely foolproof and hack-proof. You could house them in a temper-proof housing with no port, only 1 physical button and power it with a solar cell.

Banks only insure relatively small sums (100,000€ per client in my country) and don't protect your money from garnishment, seizure or an incompetent government that destroys the national currency like in Venezuela. Bank runs have happened recently in Greece. I don't doubt that services that offer insured bitcoin wallets will appear at some point though, but they'll negate the censorship resistance of bitcoin and I wouldn't use them personally, but paranoid people might.

Bitcoin will be used as a currency after the implementation of the Lightning Network and once the price gets a chance to stabilize. The day PayPal or Amazon starts accepting it, adoption will explode. You can already spend your bitcoins though PayPal or Amazon with a bitcoin debit card, but it's a stop-gap service. People in China have embraced WeChat Pay and you can already live in Chinese cities without ever touching cash or a credit card. They even pay their utilities through WeChat Pay. This will happen in the West too eventually and hopefully bitcoin will be practical enough to be integrated in what will become the equivalent of WeChat Pay.

WeChat Pay has over 600 million users and Alipay has over 450 million users. That's just one country and the technology is very new. Bitcoin is international and has plenty of great features.";1;1;False;Exotemporal;dr7gj1q;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

"I mean, drug dealers have been storing and moving cash for decades. So""if stored properly"", it can be done as well. I'm not arguing crypto will be easier, because it definitely is but now with the blow up, crypto lost alot of those advantages.
Just like when the US found out some banks were aiding in large money movements, they are going to start tracking crypto. It's already being done and considering it's all public, it's even easy to track. You won't be able to spend it in the US without them knowing, well you know, unless you break the law.

And why do you keep talking like bitcoin can't be seized? The US does it all the time. Other governments have seized it too.
And what happens if I lose my cold storage device with no backup or that gets stolen? It's the same thing man. I bet 99% of people buying bitcoin don't even understand or do cold storage. I got a buddy moving like 50k on stocks to crypto just cause of the investment and he has no idea about it, just expects exchanges to be safe, like how he doesn't have to worry about it when he leaves his money Meryl edge. 

Wechat, all pay, venmo,  all those are based on actual fiat currency. That's why people use it. Your argument doesn't even help bitcoin. Yeah we're moving to electronic payments. It's way easier. But it's still based on fiat.

Bitcoin debit card? Have you used it to buy coffee? It'll cost you 10 bucks for a 5 dollar cup of coffee. 

All the benefits your stating aren't limited to cryptocurrency dude. Fiat currently does it better than crypto and way faster. 

I'm all for crypto man, but people keep using examples like if it's exclusive to bitcoin or cryptocurrency. If Amazon or PayPal start taking it, yeah it'll move towards being a real currency, but because of the explosion right now, it's actually moving in the opposite direction. It's becoming less useful as a real currency.

And lets say bitcoin does become a widely adopted currency. It means the value has stabilized. Who's gonna mine it later when it settles and there's not much left to mine? They'd have to make money off transaction fees alone and that might not even cover costs. Right now I pay ZERO transaction fees to use venmo, my credit/debit cards, PayPal, Amazon pay, Google pay, Apple pay, wechat. In fact, they pay me to use it.

"If you break down the ""grades"" that have the US placing 15th and higher in science, math, etc.. into socio-economic rungs, our students perform as good or better than other top nations, so to say we have a crappy school system as a whole is short-sighted. We have a poverty problem on a scale that nations, especially the Scandinavian ones, do not have. Schools can't solve every social issue.

Vouchers take away from the schools that need the money and give it to a private school. If the voucher system was largely fair, i.e. truly random selection, buses provided for students that can't afford it, etc.. then I would still have issues with it, but I wouldn't be as vehemently against it as I am currently, but that has been shown to not be the case.

There will always be struggling and crappy schools as long as the US has such a large population living in and around poverty. Vouchers take away from the schools that need the funds the most and give to schools that could provide scholarships.

"What I’m saying is that it doesn’t need to be adopted as a currency to stabilize.  It can be adopted as digital gold first, and it already is.  I’d even go as far as to say that it doesn’t even need to become a currency at all to be valuable, but if it stabilizes and is widely distributed throughout the world, it will probably naturally become one.

Gold is not a currency, and its uses in industry and jewelry etc don’t justify it’s value - but it has been the best way we’ve found to store value because it has certain properties, for example it’s scarcity, and the fact that it’s difficult to counterfeit.  Bitcoin has almost all of the properties of gold, and those properties are superior in basically every category.  It’s not an immediately intuitively thing to understand, but I can highly recommend this presentation to bring it all into context:  https://youtu.be/L7BnrsIc3X0

I’m not asking you to buy bitcoin, because it doesn’t matter to me either way.  I just want people to understand it better, mostly because I ALREADY feel bad for all the people in the future who are going to wish they looked into this a little more deeply (honestly not trying to be condescending).

And yes, I did get involved early on :)
But if I had discovered it today, and came to understand it as well as I do now, I would still be buying at $20k, $100k, whatever it’s at.

The only “suckers” are the people buying in hoping to get rich, and not taking the time to really understand what they’re getting into - because those are the people that buy high and then sell in a panic at a loss.

"You can't take anyone's bitcoins if they're secured properly and you can't know how many bitcoins a person owns if they don't want anyone to know. Even if you tortured the owner, he could give you access to a dummy wallet and keep his actual wallet secret.

The price is increasing because people are buying more bitcoins than other people are willing to sell at the current price. A majority of people are keeping their bitcoins as opposed to wasting them, which wouldn't make sense. If this changed because of a catastrophic bug or bad news affecting the entire world, the price would plummet.

At the current price and with the current supply, 100 million owners can own 0.15 BTC each (less in practice because very early adopters and powerful investors own a non-negligible percentage of the supply and there's probably more than 1 million lost bitcoins), storing only ~$2,500 per person. If bitcoin keeps succeeding, we can expect more than 100 million users (1 human out of 75) and we can expect that the average user will want to store more than ~$2,500. Increase the number of users and/or the amount of money they want to store and the price will increase mechanically.

">It’s not a currency. It’s not a commodity. It’s a technology.

Everything is a technology. That doesn't mean that it's magically a ""new asset class"".

>I’m sure the horse and buggy people thought that there was an “automobile bubble” when the value of those companies started skyrocketing

I'm not having the argument about whether or not there's a bubble. I said that a person who is seasoned in all other markets is able to recognize common signs across all of those markets. Nobody was claiming that automobiles were an entirely new asset class. Every single other class of asset can experience bubbles. Every. Single. One. 

>Crypto isn’t looking to exist within the market, it’s REPLACING the market, disrupting the market. That means it will continue to grow with increasing exponency as the market begins to saturate.

I don't even know how to respond to this. 

>Crypto isn’t looking to exist within the market

What the fuck do you mean it's not looking to exist within the market? Everything exists in the market. The market is an overarching term for all mass psychology when applied to economics. This is like pre-econ 101.

>it’s REPLACING the market

What fucking market is this? Currency? There are so, so few cryptos that people are viewing as actual currency (as in, they plan to use it in their day to day life) rather than an investment. So is it replacing the investment market? Absolutely not. So what is it replacing at the moment?

>When the market has neared full saturation, it will become far more stable and will function much more as intended.

Well, no shit. That has absolutely nothing to do with the point I was making, which is that this is an asset class just like any other and asset classes are all vulnerable to bubbles and have similar signs that broadcast them. The professor said stay away from it right now. He didn't say it was going to fail in the long term.

Because they don't know how to regulate it properly yet. This isn't a fundamental, inherent quality, it's a function of the fact that nobody understands what the fuck cryptography is.

>negative inflation

This is determined by whether or not the developer of a particular crypto chooses to place a cap on the amount of coins and whether or not the developer will keep the cap in place when the shit hits the fan and deflation sets in. This is not an inherent quality of crypto. 

Additionally, see how it's increasing in value right now? That's regular inflation. If it can experience inflation for this long it's not inherently deflationary.

Secondly, people keep using the phrase 'investing in BTC'. While I understand this is a common phrase, isn't this a misnomer to the extent you're just *betting* on it? It's not like you're buying stock in order to get return on equity.

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

The difference being tuition increase was over a span of 30 years where as Bitcoin has only been over ONE year.

A fucking string of goddamn bits that people artificially inflate because of their fucking pyramid scheme to make themselves rich illegally (alt-currencies aren't legal in many countries despite those countries being scammed into allowing them; just because one law ignores a previous one doesn't make it legal) isn't a good investment either.

"> they’re trying to compete in price with other universities

That's the funniest thing I've heard all day! If you understood basic supply and demand, you'd realize that because demand is artificially inflated to the extent that it is, but supply isn't growing at the same rate, they can charge whatever they want and still get ""customers"". They're all packed to the brim by a high school system engineered to push as many students in as possible, there's no need to compete.

> The dollar isn’t backed by anyone? Have you heard of the U.S. fucking government?

And how, exactly, does the government ""ensure"" that someone will always accept it? Can I call up the police and have them point a gun at the head of a store owner because they don't want to take my money? It must take *astounding* historical and economic illiteracy to believe that a currency has any value just because it's issued by a government. Heck, it takes regular old illiteracy to believe that a currency exchangeable for nothing by the issuing body is ""backed"" at all. If it's ""backed"" by the government, then what's the exchange rate? How much ""faith and trust"" can I redeem 1 dollar for? The fact that you think a ledger has no value just demonstrates the depth of your ignorance: companies and your vaunted government both pay *fortunes* to keep track of their money.

> the real value of the US dollar has actually increased 3x in value

No, the value of *all U.S. dollars put together* has increased 3x. If you put money in a savings account in 1980, and then withdrew from it today and tried to buy something, you'd only be able to afford 1/3 of what you could back then.

Shares entitle you to dividends on profits.

">And if gold is useless as a money, what good is it?

The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry industry, and a little bit from electronics and other industries.

Gold became useless as money because it was too deflationary. Gold kept increasing in value too fast so no one wanted to spend gold coins when they could spend copper, iron, zinc, brass coins instead that wouldn't go up in value that fast.

People would shave gold coins and melt them down because it was more valuable as gold than as currency. 

>Secondly, people keep using the phrase 'investing in gold'. While I understand this is a common phrase, isn't this a misnomer to the extent you're just betting on it?

When you buy gold, the demand for gold goes up, and gold miners make more money, which allows them to mine new deposits of gold. Bitcoin supply is fixed so no matter how many people buy bitcoin there won't be anymore than there was going to be anyway.

Neither is strictly investing, but money spent on gold causes more gold to be produced, money spent on bitcoin doesn't. Speculation on gold is self-regulating because if the price gets high enough it makes it affordable to extract more gold. There's more gold in the oceans than on land, its just too expensive to profitably extract. If demand for gold got high enough we would start extracting gold from seawater, and if it got even higher we'll extract it from asteroids and other planets.

Scarcity isn't a good thing, we want as much gold as possible. Gold being expensive is a product of it being naturally scarce.

A student mentioned the new bitcoin ATH and he broke down and went on a tangent. “ this is what you can expect from 30 years of your 401K game here are the pessimistic and optimistic returns. But who cares about 401ks when you can make 1000+% return on your investment in bitcoin.” The man completely rekt his macro by putting in radical numbers.

"All the staff at a university are inevitably useful, if they weren’t they’d cut them and invest in infrastructure, they’re trying to compete in price with other universities. 
The dollar isn’t backed by anyone? Have you heard of the U.S. fucking government? The point of having it backed is that someone will always accept it for as long as it exists, ensuring that the value of it could never completely crash unless if the entity backing it disappears (and if the U.S. government falls you’ve got bigger problems than getting your bond paid back). 
The U.S. dollar is also backed by the fact that it represents work done, if you see someone carrying $10 you know that someone gave them that for providing a real good or service. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is rewarded to people running a program that updates a god damned ledger, providing no good or service, only wasting power.
The dollar has inflated to 1/3 of its value, you’re right. But that is per dollar, and that doesn’t mean shit when the money supply has increased by 9 times, meaning the real value of the US dollar has actually increased 3x in value. Meanwhile, bitcoin will never increase supply, it is strictly limited to 21 million coins.

I mean I'd be fine with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if people actually used them as currency. However as it is now people are using it as an investment which defeats it's whole purpose. If the price is so volatile no one is going to be willing to spend their bitcoins out of fear that the bitcoins they spent would drastically increase in value and thus making whatever they purchased seem a lot more expensive than was initially thought. The purpose of currency is to be an exchange medium, but if that medium's value is constantly fluctuating people won't be willing to use it.;2;1;False;The_Wanderer2077;dr7416g;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

Therefore, bitcoin investors believe value investors are wrong. But how wrong?

Crytography is also related to information theory in that numbers have certain properties as well, which also serves to maintain the network.

"Can you please check out ESMA. It's an acronym for ""Egyptian Society for Mercy to Animals"". It's a nonprofit organization in Egypt and its only aim is to save animals and shelter them until someone adopts them. Another one is called APF which is short for Animal Protection Foundation. Both organizations do the same thing and actively update their Facebook pages (linked below) with information regarding the animals they find in the streets and share images/posts.

It would be great if you donate any amount of money you can to them as it will significantly help them afford medical supplies, shelter, food, and more for the animals. Any amount of money will really help them.

"A bit of a long post here but please give it a read if you have the time:


Five years ago, someone very dear to me was forced to fight a gruesome war he did not choose, and gave his life along the way. This person meant the world to me; he was my blood, my family, and most importantly, he was my friend. This person was my amazing grandfather, who lost a war against cancer. Four years later, while the wounds from my grandfather’s death were still fresh, cancer visited my family again, this time taking my aunt with it.

We all know someone in our lives who’s been affected by cancer in one way or another. Whether it’s a loved one or a stranger, our global community changes ever so slightly whenever cancer attacks one of our loved ones. But deep down I know that we cannot be silent observers of this war – there is much that needs to be done on our side to win this war that has been going on for way too long. However, as individuals, we lack the appropriate resources to do so.

And this is why I, along with a group of 30 amazing human beings, will be running 4000 miles across the United States in the summer of 2018 to raise funds for cancer research. We will be running from San Francisco on the West Coast all the way to Baltimore on the East. Our pilgrimage is called the “4K For Cancer”, and each runner will have to raise a minimum of $5000 by April 2018. For now, my target is to raise $1000 by the end of 2017, and it would mean the world to me if you guys would support my cause by donating.

If you would like to be a part of this small but brave cause, the link to the fundraising page is down below. Donations can be made via debit or credit cards, and there is no fixed amount to donate – remember, every cent counts! Also, if you want to donate via Bitcoin, reach out to me and we can make something work!☺️

My friend Dan Weishar established the [Andrew Weishar Foundation](http://www.weish4ever.org/) to honor his brother's legacy. Their mission is to provide immediate resources to families with adolescents or young adults stricken with cancer. They provide financial assistance to these families in need at their more dire times.

"I applaud your generosity, the world needs more people like you. May I suggest WarAmps? They provide funding for children with amputations for their prostheses for their entire life, and encourage all of them to pursue sports and provide them with devices for sports. They have yearly seminars where young amputees and their parents get together and share stories and experiences, learn how to deal with the everyday issues of life as an amputee, and some of the difficulties it can present as children. How to deal with bullying is a major concern. They also match up families of children that have similar amputations so they can learn from each other.

These devices are very expensive, ranging from $5000 to $30,000 or higher. Until around 18 years old or so they require a new device just about every year due to growth.

Another vote for a donation to OMF.ngo from a ME/CFS sufferer. Please support them.. We patients are suffering with no help. I got sick and never got better.. lost my job, independence, apartment 4 years ago. I used to have a Director level job in NYC, and now I am too ill to leave the house, and my family takes care of me. It’s a devastating illness. You become so ill with cognitive deficits, headaches, and unrelenting debilitating weakness and fatigue. It leaves you unable to participate in life, or even care for yourself. 

OMF is an innovative foundation based in Silicon Valley. They fund work at the Stanford, and have put together a stellar team of scientists to tackle Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.  But, they need more funding to be effective. They cannot hire researchers unless they can show a runway of funding for several years work.

"I like the idea of effective altruism, but I think the goal of ""saving as many lives as possible"" is very arbitrary and in some ways shortsighted and counterproductive. We don't need more human life on Earth, but less in absolute numbers, and more in terms of a higher average quality of life. So, I would say that the best charities are those who help people to have smaller families and healthier, safer lives, in a healthy, protected environment. Saving a child from Malaria is useless if that child doesn't get any education, and later starves because of a drought that is due to climate change and bad planning by a corrupt government.

That way the money will never run out and I can still give a ton away every year.

We're also trying to hopefully be able to hire a few folks to get some more help cleaning up the UI, managing social media and scaling up!

"Hello Pineapple,
I've been trying to purchase Antminer S9's ASIC hardware to create a mining farm and donate to research for Multiple Sclerosis and Tinnitus.

I so far have collected 6,000 euros and I am waiting for 2 S9's in January 9th delivery.

My idea is to donate 60% of all my profits to researchers. Imagine if you have 15x14,7/th antminer s9's mining all at once. I could donate over 10k per month, for life.
Imagine if you have 150 of those, I could donate more than 100k USD per month...

I am trying to donate them because I myself have been suffering from Tinnitus past 8 years and MS symptoms have been progressing past 3 years. It's not a thing you want in your life but you can't do nothing about it, especially those damn medicines that have so many bad-sides that may even worsen condition.

If you are interested and have a trust in me, that I could pull this off, I would love to send  you a PM with more info how my plan would go. If it helps, I could name it Pineapple MTÜ (Meaning Pineapple NON-PROFIT-ORGAZINATION) in our country.

Even a donation of bitcoin mining hardware would be better since I would have to buy those anyway with the money donated, my whole goal was and still is to run 15 antminer s9's - two of them I could afford, rest is still to gain. Even when you won't donate, no problems, I understand that you help alot and that is f*****g unbelievable. 

Faith in humanity restored. Thanks Pineapple!";-2;0;False;packard99;dr79szq;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

You know I have thought about it a lot. About who one should help when being a philanthropist. There is a lot of people helping the poor, animals, nature etc. But I think one issue that is overlooked is (like one of the comments stated in a joking manner) is to help hardworking people out of their endless debt spiral. One if the worst stress point in families are financial concerns and it occurs in a lot of hardworking families, and also the cause of many suicides. I know I went through a rough patch myself before and am currently trying to help a good friend through his. The thing is how to do this is an issue, as said people are usually too proud to accept assistance... with my friend it is obviously different.  I thought I can convince some of them into buying Bitcoin but then they can't afford buying any and will panic on dips. Just a thought. Maybe people smarter than me can figure out how to do this.

"Hello!  

Bright Beginnings for Kittitas County is a 501(c)3 nonprofit early learning center in Kittitas County, WA (www.bbfkc.org) and we target poverty in our communities by engaging families with young children in building stronger foundations for their future.

BBFKC provides high quality, individualized intervention services for children under 5 including a Birth-3 program connecting children with physical and cognitive disabilities with special care service providers and in-home education for the parents to help their child better interact with the world they're growing up in. 

Kittitas County has experienced a drop in child care providers and capacity that significantly impacts access to child care for the residents of this rural county especially when taking into account approximately 72.2% children under 6 have all parents working and 1 in 6 of all children under 18 in Kittitas County live in poverty.

As the largest early learning provider in Kittitas County, these results make it clear BBFKC is a driving force in our community to provide early learning opportunities for its residents, and indicates BBFKC needs to adapt to the changing market by creating a plan to expand hours and number of children our programs can serve. 

Funds for expansion will help BBFKC break the cycle of poverty by providing more families in Kittitas County access to high quality early learning resources and will decrease the unemployment rate for families currently unable work due to lack of childcare.

We've applied through the website with detailed contact info. Thank you so much for the opportunity!";1;0;False;brightbeginnings;dr7ihvo;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"[Cape Cod Samaritans](http://capesamaritans.org/) 

These people do great work around my neck of the woods. They recently hosted Daryl Hammond (absolutely moving performance) to mark their anniversary and to help get the word out. 

Suicide prevention is a huge issue on Cape Cod, given the tourist driven economy and long cold winters.  The work they do is difficult and are always on the lookout for any and all help. 

Recently they spent 6 months writing a proposal to get a Federal grant and thanks to their tireless efforts they are now in the process of hiring to fulfill the grant!

Money donated to them would be very well managed. I can put you in touch with the woman in charge if they’d fit the bill.

"Please, please, please donate to the Huntington's Disease Society of America! From community services and education to advocacy and research, HDSA is the world’s leader in providing help for today and hope for tomorrow for people with Huntington’s disease and their families. 

It is a VERY UNKNOWN disease with NO CURE yet; scientist are working extremely hard to find something that will work, but it's hard to do that when no one even knows what it is. 

Huntington Disease along with many other disease that don't get a chance in the spotlight (unlike cancer), makes it extremely challenging to get the funds that they need for research. 

As someone who has a history of HD in my family and was diagnosed as positive for it at the age of 19, any amount of help you can give them would be wonderful. Thank you so much for all that you are doing; God bless! 😊❤

"Hi Pineapple, 

Excellent idea! Would you consider **investing** for social/environmental impact instead? There is an increasing number of investment funds all over the world trying to invest in businesses that are solving social or environmental challenges (e.g. access to clean energy, health, education, poverty reduction). Many impact investors argue that you can improve the state of the world (particularly in developing countries) and still make a financial return. Worst case scenario you lose your entire investment in which case you have simply made a charitable donation (well without the tax break), but if the business is successful (and there are many examples) you will earn a return on your investment, which you can then re-invest in other good causes. A gift that keeps on giving!

Donating to Mast cell disorder research would be a great cause. Not too much research has been done, compared to other medical research, and the effect of mast cells on the body is huge and not fully researched. I’m a veteran and got sick during the Iraq war and after years of doctors it turned out I had developed a mast cell disorder (MCAS). It’s only gotten worse over the years and right now the only treatment is pills, and they’re not even the best at stabilizing the mast cell. I’ll forward this to some non profits doing research, it would be a great cause. ;1;0;False;RadChadAintYoDad;dr7k2vf;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Another ME/CFS patient here. 

Notice my username? It’s because I’ve considered doing online sex work as a last resort to avoid having to file bankruptcy— at 26 — because I got sick my last year of university and still have to pay back mountains of student debt I thought I’d be able to work full time or more to pay back. 

I was healthy until I wasn’t (never fully recovered from a flu), and I never expected I’d become disabled right out of university. Had I known this would happen to me, I would have forgone education in favour of working for those 5 years so I’d be able to access disability support. At this point I’ve never actually taken payment for sex work, because I managed to find a job I can just barely manage at 10 hours a week from home. 

Here in Canada, it’s estimated that up to 2% of our entire population could be affected by this disease, yet there is no support from our government or medical system. A large donation to the OMF could make a difference in the lives of millions of people on a global scale. 

I hope anyone reading this will understand I’ve told this story the way I have to show how difficult and desperate life with ME/CFS can get (suicide is a big killer among our patient group), not to try and gain personally from my “sob story.” Thanks!";29;2;False;princesscollegefund;dr74jcn;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Another very sick patient here. Mostly homebound and bedbound. Excellent doctors who simply don't know what to do. 

Copying and pasting from my comment on another part of the thread: 

This was written by u/AlexanderSupersloth on another post and it does a nice job of explaining CFS. I will also add the OMF applied to The Pineapple Fund this morning, so hopefully something comes of it. 

> Hey man. This is remarkably generous.

> I'd like to propose the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). The OMF is an organisation that funds research into chronic complex diseases. The diseases it targets are often drastically underserved by both public and private financing, as well as being misunderstood by the public at large.

> This is something which actually strikes very close to home for me. I unfortunately suffer from very severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Many people have heard of CFS/ME, and think it is just a case of simply being tired. This misunderstanding has caused chronic underfunding and wider social stigma, which has unnecessarily prolonged suffering of patients for many years.

> This depiction of the illness, however, couldn't be further from the truth. Very few chronic condition can become as severe as CFS/ME without causing death. Around 25% of people are completely bedridden. I know people who cannot speak, cannot sit up in bed, cannot chew food. These patients are left in this state for years or sometimes decades. Hooked up to feeding tubes, they are completely aware of their situation and in excruciating pain.

> Despite the possible severity of the condition, we do not know what causes it and there is no treatment.

> I am 27 years old, but I am completely bedridden. Fortunately I am not as severe as the patients mentioned above, but I am still extremely limited. I used to run 20 miles a week. I kayaked and mountain biked. I had an active work and social life. Now my legs cant even support my own weight. The last time i left the house was 6 months ago, and that was on a stretcher so i could get to a hospital appointment. Other than that, I haven't been able to leave the house for years.

> I need treatment, but we don't even know why I am sick. Research funding is desperately desperately needed. I and millions of other patients globally would be extremely grateful if you were able to donate to research via the OMF.

> Please feel free to ask any questions.

"Among the medical-focused organizations, I'll stick in a plug for The [Cystic Fibrosis Foundation](https://www.cff.org/) (CFF), who I also recommended in the other charity post.

They gather funds to support research for finding a cure for the ~70,000 individuals struggling with Cystic Fibrosis worldwide.

The Foundation itself has been recognized as one of the few medical-treatment-focused charities that's actually seen new drugs and treatments come to market because of their funding that have significantly extended the lives of those patients they're seeking to help. That's due in large part to the way they've been managing their donation money; most organizations focused on curing a specific medical issue offer bounties in the form of ""if you create a cure, we'll give you X dollars"", but that places all the risk on the pharmaceutical companies themselves (if they do all the research and come up with nothing, it's their loss). CFF instead does more with ""If you are doing active research on a cure for CF, we'll pay you Y dollars/year"", which shares the risk with the foundation itself. 

Because of that, the foundation has much more insight into drugs that are in various stages of readiness (not just the drugs that are past clinical trials), and leads to a [pretty full pipeline](https://www.cff.org/Trials/Pipeline) of promising drugs.

In the interest of full disclosure, I do have a bias towards CFF because I have a family member with CF.";2;1;False;MidnightLightning;dr6wysy;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"If you want to donate to someone who's on the cutting edge of a new frontier in the biomedical sciences, look into Michael Levin at Tufts University, and his Institute for Regenerative Biology at Tufts.

He's a computer scientist that did his PhD in Developmental Biology at Harvard. He looks for top down mechanisms of control regarding morphology and development that can be used in regenerative medicine. His findings regarding the role of membrane voltage outside the nervous system will rewrite text books in a few years, as well as many other major topics, like mechanisms of biological memory. He does every level of analysis important in a scientific, he doesn't just publish the results of experiments, he develops mathematical models, explores the philosophical significance, pushes new theoretical foundations and promotes new ways to do science. If you want to get a sense of what topics he's interested in, check out his recommended books page in his resources section, or just skim the titles of his publications. 

A real world application: he's shown that cancer, which is often A failure of patterning, can be corrected by modulating the membrane voltage of cancer cells. No genetic interventions or toxic treatments necessary, just some ion channel drugs applied in the right place. 

I've corresponded with him on a few ocassions and I'd be more than happy to assist in the process of dontating to him / the institute of regenerative biology, should you choose to.

"It would be a ""generic med"" in the same sense that antibiotics are. A given antibiotic targets a specific class of microbes, and each variant of DRACO would target a specific class of viruses, but in both cases these classes span multiple disease agents. They're likely both to be medications available only be prescription for similar reasons. (DRACO-resistant viruses can and will develop, although many diseases are likely to be eradicated entirely, so making these sorts of antivirals available over the counter would be asking for long-term trouble.)

Why is big pharma not putting money into this? Because it is insanely more profitable to sell treatment regimens that lessen symptoms and extend life expectancy rather than fix the underlying problem. This is not conspiracy but simple plain-as-day fact: the revenue that could be generated by curing a disease is pennies compared to the opportunity cost given up when there is a once-a-day antiviral regimen that keeps it at bay instead, at $10's of dollars or more per-patient, per-day.

"Dear PineappleFund,

If you support [SENS](http://www.sens.org/), then you will also support [LEAF Science](https://www.leafscience.org/).

Talk to Steve Hill about it. His Facebook is: https://www.facebook.com/steve.hill.560.

His Reddit user is /u/jansen1975.

I support both SENS as well as LEAF Science. I'm not here to convince you of how to split your Bitcoin between them.

I just want to emphasize the following:

Depending on the size of your contribution, you might very well help bring the cure for aging a couple of days/weeks/months/years closer.

For every single day that your donation brings it closer, you will save 100,000 human lives.

Because that's how many people die from aging every day.

Aging is the world's most important problem, because it creates the greatest amount of grief.

There is no more efficient way of donating your Bitcoins in terms of decreasing world suck, than to donate it to life extension research.

You are in the unique position of:

- holding lots of Bitcoins
- supporting life extension
- willing to donate to life extension research

Make no mistake. No other person on this planet is currently wielding as much power as you are.

There has never been a greater technophilanthropic anywhere on this planet, in the entire history of mankind.

Donate to life extension research and you shall become the unsung hero of the 21st century.

"Nobody wants money. Money is either something you exchange for something else you want, or a status symbol and power over those who have not. It's not an end-goal in itself.

What do you want in life? Most people fail to answer that question because whatever the answer is they haven't enough money to achieve it, so they seek money and put off asking those questions. Maybe that's what you mean?

I'd suggest sitting down and really sorting out what you want to accomplish, what makes you happy, and what would be a life worth having lived. Like 99% of the people out there, you will find that the answers to these questions require resources you don't have, and the near-term solution is to work longer, invest more, and generally make more money. But unless you have a weird (and sad) money-counting fetish, I suspect mere accumulation of money is not the driving purpose in your life, or the lives of the 99%.

Most people want security for themselves and their family -- meaning a house that's theirs and food on the table, indefinitely. Good health. Time to spend with their family and friends, or doing hobbies they enjoy. Obviously money buys time, security, and the consumables of life. Many people, though sadly not most, want a purpose or cause to work for, and money gives them both the time to work towards that, and the leverage to achieve it. But none of these motivations are for money for money's sake. If that's what you're chasing, I suggest you take some time off to consider what you're doing with your life and why.";11;2;False;maaku7;dr7axgt;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Giving money makes him happy. A lot of people have to focus on money to even survive, therefore they are motivated to go to work and make money and that can sometimes be all they do if they're working 2 jobs.

Hello! I literally made a Reddit account just for this. My buddy above^ and I started this charity because after years of handing out sandwiches to the homeless in our community we collected their feedback on what they wanted, and it was so simple it broke our hearts: a place to shower and wash our clothes. After researching some other awesome charities like LavaMae we, too, wanted to bring a shower bus to our area.

"From /u/Aaron_FF below...   

Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://www.maps.org/). They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.

MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.

In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.

"I'd also suggest GiveDirectly. I've donated to them a few times when I've been able to spare the cash (although slightly lower amounts than you're bestowing, OP!) 
They're one of the highest rated charities on GiveWell, and they take a highly evidence-based approach, undertaking detailed experiments to make sure donations are used as effectively as possible.

But my favourite aspect of GiveDirectly is that it treats charity recipients as adults. Instead of assuming a foreign-based charity knows how to come in and fix their problems, they recognise that even extremely low-income households know what is in their best interest but just require a bit of help to achieve it. They've shown some amazing results with this approach and have some really lovely case studies. 

But whatever charities you choose, you're doing an amazing thing that will really make a difference to a lot of people's lives.

"Another bedbound ME/CFS patient here.

This is an excellent cause, one of the most under funded cruel and devastating diseases. It’s also been misunderstood dismissed and marginalised for years. Uk funding was ~10 million over the last 10 years compared to ~74 million for MS which has half the number of sufferers. A lot of that research in the Uk was been hijacked by psychiatrists (approx 7-8 million) who have hoovered up a lot of funding and blown it on poor research to try and promote their exercise based psych treatments which don’t work and harm patients. It’s a modern day medical scandal. Recently There has been a paradigm shift away from these treatments led by patients, Alem Matthews requested data via a FOI the university tried to vilify patients as vexatious, the court ruled these claims were unfounded and released the data paving the way for reanalysis showing that the research claims were bogus. Alem is sadly bedbound now unable to read, his mum reads him ME news and messages. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now dropped the psych treatments CBT and GET from their list of recommended treatments for CFS/ME and NICE in the UK are reviewing their guidelines.

"This was written by u/AlexanderSupersloth on another post and it does a nice job of explaining CFS. I will also add the OMF applied to The Pineapple Fund this morning, so hopefully something comes of it. 

> Hey man. This is remarkably generous.

> I'd like to propose the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). The OMF is an organisation that funds research into chronic complex diseases. The diseases it targets are often drastically underserved by both public and private financing, as well as being misunderstood by the public at large.

> This is something which actually strikes very close to home for me. I unfortunately suffer from very severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Many people have heard of CFS/ME, and think it is just a case of simply being tired. This misunderstanding has caused chronic underfunding and wider social stigma, which has unnecessarily prolonged suffering of patients for many years.

> This depiction of the illness, however, couldn't be further from the truth. Very few chronic condition can become as severe as CFS/ME without causing death. Around 25% of people are completely bedridden. I know people who cannot speak, cannot sit up in bed, cannot chew food. These patients are left in this state for years or sometimes decades. Hooked up to feeding tubes, they are completely aware of their situation and in excruciating pain.

> Despite the possible severity of the condition, we do not know what causes it and there is no treatment.

> I am 27 years old, but I am completely bedridden. Fortunately I am not as severe as the patients mentioned above, but I am still extremely limited. I used to run 20 miles a week. I kayaked and mountain biked. I had an active work and social life. Now my legs cant even support my own weight. The last time i left the house was 6 months ago, and that was on a stretcher so i could get to a hospital appointment. Other than that, I haven't been able to leave the house for years.

> I need treatment, but we don't even know why I am sick. Research funding is desperately desperately needed. I and millions of other patients globally would be extremely grateful if you were able to donate to research via the OMF.

> Please feel free to ask any questions.

What a number of organizations and scientists propose is to invest money in preventing the plastic to reach the oceans rather than trying to clean it up afterwards. In the end, maybe we need both but if money is diverted to the the TOCP instead of going to early catch of plastic then it is globally negative.

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 10 years ago (im 42 now).  I had surgery initially to remove 12 inches if my small intestines, and started Remicade afterwards.  I have been in deep remision for over 9 years now. I get Remicade drip every 8 weeks for the rest of my life or until there is a cure.  Without insurance, it would cost around $6000 / session.  With insurance, it comes out to about $900, and Remistart, a program to help Remicade patients with their costs, takes care of about 80% of those costs.

"There are statistics that show that the higher child mortality is, the larger families tend to be. If you expect your children to die, you have more. Even if some of them die, that's a lot of time and resources being spent. If you lower mortality rates, families have fewer children, which saves resources to make their lives better in other ways.

I forget the terminology, but Peter Singer's book *The Most Good You Can Do* also talks about a metric that measures ""years of healthy life"" or something like that, so some charities certainly focus on that.

Not to say education, environment, and government corruption aren't important topics. There are many metrics that can be used to define ""good,"" so it's hard to come up with a single best one. I guess ""lives saved"" is just the easiest to think about.";12;1;False;MrBlackchevy;dr7gej4;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"- It isn't just ""cure a child from malaria and then drop him/her in a ditch"". Their estimations include difficult value choices like ratio between saving a life and elevating one's income from poverty. You can look at different value calls (as well as other less ephemeral assumptions) of GiveWell [here](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models). If you have a worm in your body or your child is sick, you can't really be productive. These interventions boost economy as well.

"1. I'd also rise my support for Effective Altruism. They are very smart people on the planet thinking about how to help people. It was founded on ideas by Robin Hanson and eg. Peter Singer has endorsed it. I think anyone who logically starts to think how to help people will end up something like Effective Altruism. The main idea behind EA is that most charities exist because people want to help but or completely uninterested in EFFECTIVENESS of the charities. When you actually start to rank them, demand RCT's and stuff like that.

3. Donate to end animal suffering. I'm not even animal activist but on intellectual level I appreciate the work they do: https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/

4. Medical research. Horrible diseases that cannot be cured. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's, Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases and 10 other diseases nobody knows about. Very few of them accept bitcoin I think.

9. Well FLI does work on existential risks to humanity (eg. climate change): https://futureoflife.org/

10. ALLFED is an organization that support work on securing food supply in case of nuclear war, asteroid impact, supervolcano eruption etc. I have once read paper that securing food supplies for future generations would save more epected lives than all developed nations charity combined. http://allfed.info/

11. Maybe MIRI. They just do research to help keep future AI safe. They accept Bitcoin. https://intelligence.org/

12. Donate to: https://80000hours.org/
They help people find a career which let people have great impact on their life on the world. I don't know if they need money though.

13. Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

14. There are lots of open source projects (eg. Linux foundation) who would probably need more money but given that the effect on human welfare is close to nil I am not going to recommend any. I think it would be easier to start a foundation for ""unfunded open source projects of importance"" and donate to them. For example EA uses criteria of: important, neglected, tractable.

15. I'm going to be devil's advocate and say politics. Usually only the government has the coordination and money to do something about and electing smart people is way to go. I am not going to say who or what to support. What is your goal here? Reduce suffering? Lots of things to do on health care, sanitation, infrastructure, education, basic research etc. Support candidates with science-background to be honest. I think if something that should be defended is reason and Enlightenment against populism. The candidate which I would support in US would be different I would support in Sweden.

16. The truth is that efficient charity is really hard. First of all, what is your goal? To end suffering? Well probably most of suffering is in developing world? How do you quantify it? What is the most effective approach? How about future lives? How about existential risks? Does that charity ever reach its goal? Opportunity costs? EA answers these questions quite well but the same kind of scrutiny does not usually exist outside EA supported charities (because the value of helping say people with rare disease is much smaller than helping the real poor in Africa).

"Exactly. I really hope OP spoke with a tax accountant and estate attorney (who specializes in charitable trusts/foundation's) before putting any of this through.

Avoiding a ton of tax on all of that gain is the tip of the iceberg.

I'll copy and paste something I wrote elsewhere recently:

""The very wealthy can get more benefit from their charitable aspirations though. My favorite strategy is this:

* Place highly appreciated assets into an Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT). Maybe you own $10m of Bitcoin and you originally paid $25,000.

* You receive a huge tax deduction that can be carried forward. You also avoid paying tax on all the gain those appreciated assets had.

* You receive income from the trust as long as you are alive. This can be setup in a few different ways, but is often 5% of the value of the trust.

* At your death, the remaining assets are given to a charity that you had chosen.

* Funny thing is, you designate a foundation. A foundation that is formed at your death.

* This foundation's purpose is to monetarily support a cause (e.g. a foundation that awards a scholarship annually for low-income students interested in programming).

* Your offspring manage this foundation, drawing salaries (finance, accounting, attorney work etc.). Foundation's are generally required to output 5% of their assets annually to support their cause. These salaries eat into that 5%.

That's a whole lot of benefit. It's kind of fucked up how many crazy opportunities open up when you have a lot of money.""

Now, the main problem that strategy is that the charities don't see benefit until you pass away. Really, you could just give part of your income to charity each year. Or, you could just put 50%/etc. toward the remainder trust instead of the whole thing and the rest could go into your foundation right now. You could then start giving how you want now with the foundation, while receiving income to live off of from the remainder trust which will eventually pay a huge sum to your existing foundation.

Sci-Hub is a website with over 64.5 million academic papers and articles available for direct download. It bypasses publisher paywalls by allowing access through educational institution proxies. Sci-Hub stores papers in its own repository, and additionally the papers downloaded by Sci-Hub are also stored in Library Genesis (LibGen).

Sci-Hub was founded by Kazakhstani graduate student Alexandra Elbakyan in 2011, as a reaction to the high cost of research papers behind paywalls, typically US$30 each when bought on a per-paper basis.

Not that what OP is doing is wrong, I admire them very much, I'd personally just appreciate 1 on 1 basises of help for 1 person, family, or class at a time that can really appreciate that *you* helped them.;1;0;False;therestruth;dr73kjq;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

It was ruled that these people could not be held against their will and since they all have mental illness they tend to make bad decisions.  If you've ever known someone schizophrenic you know how daunting it can be to get them to take their medication.

"Actually empathy is going up, and violence going down, as natural selection weeds out the oversized, anti-social dinosaurs of the human world.

I don't recommend actually reading the whole book by Steven Pinker, unless you really love overly detailed history, but the Better Angels of Our Nature talks about this.  And also, just looking at the statistics of how many people give resources (monetary, material, intellectual, or emotional) support to even total strangers across the planet, will help you see that we're getting more and more connected as a species, and feeling more like we are all in this together.

It might not seem that way on the surface, with governments and politicians and Hollywood being all about the psychopaths of life, but the general public is very different, when you get to know them personally.";1;1;False;Turil;dr7ima7;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"**Epidermolysis bullosa**

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of mainly inherited connective tissue diseases that cause blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, with an incidence of 20 per million newborns in the United States. It is a result of a defect in anchoring between the epidermis and dermis, resulting in friction and skin fragility. Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.

The condition was brought to public attention in 2004 in the UK through the Channel 4 documentary The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off, chronicling the life and death of Jonny Kennedy, an Englishman with EB. In the United States, the same could be said of the HBO documentary My Flesh and Blood from 2003.

"I like your idea but i dislike that you will be donating it all to charity. There are so many tech, med and agricultural startups that need funds desperately.

Investing in companies like these will allow you to actually help more people. We need companies to research the advancements that will be needed and we need investors that are willing to take the risk.

Charities help but in the long term clean energy, clean food and advanced medicine will help humanity a lot more.

For charities I can only name a few I know need funds critically in south africa:

SPCA (animal welfare group)
Red cross

Why not just donating it.

Why collecting more bitcoins? Why not motivate others to just donate, why it should go thorugh your wallet?

"My wife has Crohns disease, an auto immune disorder where the body attacks itself throughout the entire digestive tract. It is non-curable, only treatment and management of the symptoms can be done. In 3rd world countries (like where we are) the cost of medicine in order to keep her in remission is outrageous and that is where a lot of our money goes to in order to keep her well. If there are charities or donations towards Crohns or auto immune diseases that can help to produce biologics and medicine to then sell at a lower price then that would be an amazing donation. 

Started investing any extra money into cryptocurrency to make gains so not worry about buying medicine again in the future for her, and also to go above that and try make enough money to purchase a house for us where we can  be close to a hospital for her. All proving very difficult with the expense of medicine though.

"Please consider these organizations:

* [Harvard Personal Genome Project](https://pgp.med.harvard.edu/) - providing an open science platform for people to donate their health and genomic data to the public (and science).  They also sequence participants when funds are available.
* [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) - providing an open science platform for people to share their health and genomic data and connect participants to scientific researchers
* [OpenSNP](https://opensnp.org/) - providing an open science platform for people to share their  genotyping information (e.g. 23andMe, Ancestry.com, etc. data) as well as providing questionnaires for participants.

All of these provide an invaluable service to the scientific community in providing free/libre and often unencumbered (as in CC0) data to the public at large, instead of a select few researchers.  They're almost always chronically underfunded and could definitely use the funds.

For some context, whole genome sequencing is about $1000. $10M could theoretically sequence 10k people.  Imagine what kind of machine learning, scientific insight and data analysis could be done on 10,000 whole genomes that's made available to the public.

* More than 10,000 experienced developers have gotten even better developer jobs.

* FreeCodeCamp is 100% free and doesn't charge **anything** for certifications.


I did learn web development at FreeCodeCamp myself, so I can confirm that it's a great learning platform and community.
In 2016, while I was studying there, we run a [survey](https://2016-new-coder-survey.freecodecamp.org) to find out that people all around the world use FreeCodeCamp to learn coding.

"How about the Syrian American Medical Society? They provide a wide range of medical care within and around Syria for those affected by the war. The situation has been and still is desperate for countless innocent people in Syria.

I traveled to Syria before the war and couchsurfed with a guy in Aleppo who I still keep in touch with. His family made it safely to Turkey, but his brother is an MD and would travel into Aleppo during heavy fighting to provide medical care. There was a time when the city was surrounded and everyone feared a civilian massacre. Turns out he was actually behind enemy lines and all of us were terrified he would be killed. He somehow made it back to Turkey safely.

This guy was super fortunate to have made it out of Aleppo with his family (I mean what else matters in life?), only to risk his life and the financial stability of his family to selflessly help those in the most dire situation. He was working for SAMS during all of this. I had never donated anything in my life but after learning about all of this, I now give regularly and without hesitation. I met a ton of Syrians as a solo backpacker in their country and EVERY SINGLE PERSON treated me with a level of hospitality that blew me away. I like to think that my modest donations have helped at least one of those people or their loved ones.

"Hi, I'll try to get in contact with the local shelters I'm about to mention and get them to apply, but first I'd like to give them a signal boost here, just in case you see it. :) 

The first shelter I'm going to mention is RescueCats (http://www.rescuecats.org/home.aspx). This is where me and my boyfriend got both of our sweet babies. They're a no-kill charity that (contrary to their name) saves both cats and dogs. In addition to taking in shelter overflow. they take in animals that most county shelters would simply consider putting down, ones with life-long diseases like our cats have. Even if their cats never get adopted, they keep them. Nox and Muffin, our cats we adopted, are FIV+, which is feline HIV. Please consider giving even a little to these awesome people. They're not very good technologically, their website is crap and their FB is hilariously non-marketable, but the group is just a bunch of sweet older-people who are just trying to do the best they can to make a difference. In addition to this, if you know someone who is good with website design, they've asked for a volunteer to re-design their website. Here's their FB if you wanted to get in contact with them: https://m.facebook.com/rescuecats.inc/?tsid=0.014401316697298272&source=result
 
They tend to answer FB messages fastest. :)

The second shelter I'm going to try and put out there, is the Georgia House Rabbit Society (https://www.houserabbitga.com). I actually volunteer here fairly regularly- they're amazing folks. In addition to being a no-kill rabbit shelter, we've also rescued birds, squirrels, and guinea pigs. We're in the process of trying to build a larger facility (because our place is basically a house that we've done our best to convert), but things are always tight at the shelter. We take in so much overflow, as well as being called out to catch rabbits that people have reported, and we take in big rabbit dumps (I think the largest we've ever taken in at once was the Big Tree dump, it was like 40-something rabbits found by a creek, but Jen, the shelter manager, would know for sure). Our shelter is constantly full, but we take as many buns in as possible. Sometimes we barely have walking room, haha.

I know that a lot of people think that rabbits can live in the wild, but that's simply not true. There's the north american cottontail, which is the non-domesticated breed of rabbit, which is fine in the wild. Then there's basically everyone else. There's a lot of misinformation about rabbits out there (that carrots are good for them is probably the biggest), but buns are as sweet and kind an animal as any cat or dog, and bunnies deserve the same recognition as friends that we bestow upon other pets.

I'm not sure if you'll see this, but if you do, please consider helping these shelters out. Also, if you're considering giving to your own local shelters, please don't try to do so through the HUSA (Humane Society of the United States). Only 1% of their donations go to the local shelter that bear a similar name (Humane Society of Cherokee County, etc.). Just donating straight to the local shelter is typically the best option.

Thank you so much for any consideration you've given to these places, and congratulations to you for hodling long enough to make it this big. :)";3;1;False;nightgoatgoesbaaah;dr6udl2;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I'm sure you're seeing all kinds of posts about charities, so I'll add mine here as well. 

I recently left my New York City job as a software engineer at Yahoo to CoFound a small startup with one of my best friends in my local community. We started out giving food to the homeless every day, but we have a dream of creating the very first shower bus on the east coast. 

Our goal is that we can use this bus to provide free hygiene, first aid, haircuts, and health services to our local community. If the homeless don't appear different than anyone else, than they won't be. 

We only need about 300,000 to retrofit the bus, we just ran our first successful fundraiser earlier this year after becoming a 501(c)(3). 

I've been following the Bitcoin community forever but have always been too cowardly to invest myself. 

We've submitted an application to the Pineapple  Fund. If you were willing to support our mission I would be incredibly grateful, and the underserved homeless community of New Jersey would appreciate your sacrifice. 

You can find more info about the mission here: https://ArmNewBrunswick.org 

Whether you choose to support us or not, thank you for doing this. You're making the world better.

"Shout out to [Stichting Ambulancewens](https://www.ambulancewens.nl/) *(Ambulance Wish Foundation)*.

This is a Dutch non-profit organisation *(also do work in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Israel and Sweden)* that grants wishes to terminal *(non-mobile)* people and their families. 

These kind souls granted a wish for my mother last year *(only a few weeks before she past away)* and I will take any opportunity to spread the word of the awesome work they do. My mother had cancer and was unable to move after she broke her leg and pelvis after falling *(her bones had become too brittle)*. Stichting Ambulancewens granted her wish to have one last day out with her family *(my sisters, her husband and myself)*. Two awesome volunteers came to pick her up with the ambulance and gave her one last fantastic day out in the open air with the people she loved. Due to her complications this would not have been possible without them.


My mother was so touched by their work, that she wanted people to donate money to Stichting Ambulancewens, instead of buying flowers for her funeral.


This is a relatively small foundation and any form/amount of donations has a huge inpact on it and the people they help. They are 100% volunteers and put all the donation money towards stuff like new equipment (such as second hand ambulances) and the wishes of the people.

"Check out Giveth.io :-D We are very very close to launching our alpha where you can create your own blockchain based ""charity"" that we call a Decentralized Altruistic Community.

We are a 100% nonprofit decentralized community DAO-ifying charity, Empowering Donors to provide oversight over exactly how their donations get used and connecting the donors directly to the people making the change they want to see in the world (no charity in the middle).

We are on Ethereum right now but are very closely connected to RSK and will deploy our platform on their side chain when once we feel we have a steady DApp working on the Ethereum Blockchain. We presented at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference and I shared the stage with Deigo from RSK (and Peter Todd and Trace Mayer) and one of our founding members, Grace, helped RSK organize the conference. 

We accept ETH donations at `revolution.eth` which resolves to 0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc If you send us ETH from an address you own, you will receive Giveth Tokens which will be used for Giveth’s governance once we go full on DAO :-D

"My wife has Crohns disease, an auto immune disorder where the body attacks itself throughout the entire digestive tract. It is non-curable, only treatment and management of the symptoms can be done. In 3rd world countries (like where we are) the cost of medicine in order to keep her in remission is outrageous and that is where a lot of our money goes to in order to keep her well. If there are charities or donations towards Crohns or auto immune diseases that can help to produce biologics and medicine to then sell at a lower price then that would be an amazing donation. 

Started investing any extra money into cryptocurrency to make gains so not worry about buying medicine again in the future for her, and also to go above that and try make enough money to purchase a house for us where we can  be close to a hospital for her.

"Welp, I submitted a more selfish one.

I work in a disadvantaged rural school school in Australia. Our kids limit of technology and stem exposure is a few PC labs and a couple Lego robots kits.

We've applied twice for a grant supposed to supply up to $4million to exactly our situation in buckets up to $50k for laser cutters and maker spaces, and been knocked back each time.

So I applied and asked for $100k. We could by a massively useful laser cutter, a few 3d printers, maybe even a small educational milling machine. This is tech that otherwise doesn't exist in 300 miles for our kids.

I realise in terms of total impact, eff, Wikipedia, and lots of others could likely get much more impact straight up, but this would make a massive amount of difference to a few hundred students every year for potentially decades.

Shrugs. I've submitted and op is the decision holder.

"There are a lot of projects that would benefit from this, and though not charities per se, but they are beneficial to everyone, as they're free and open:

1. https://matrix.org/ - decentralized, federated chat protocol, with optional encryption, that lets you bridge other networks, so you can use one client for all you chatting needs (well not really as bright looking now, has rough edges, but really promising project)


1. https://www.libreoffice.org/ - Office Suite that has been forked from OpenOffice when Sun acquired Oracle

1. https://ardour.org/ - open source cross-platform DAW

1. https://www.blender.org/ - probably everyone knows blender already (if not, it's 3D graphics suite), so I think they are doing pretty well, but yeah, great project

1. https://www.gimp.org/, https://krita.org/ and https://inkscape.org - for different kinds of 2d graphics

1. https://donate.mozilla.org/ - probably even more known than blender, they are really doing great job.

1. https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/- charity that takes care of multiple open source projects.

That's just from the top of my head, there's a lot more projects that would need help, if anything else comes to my mind, I'll keep adding it here.

"Well done, it's good to see someone do something nice and worthwhile with their 'good luck'.

Have you thought about buying (and holding or even burning) some GridCoin and CureCoin? These are not your usual cryptocoins in both the way they are created but also what is achieved..

Both are issued/created from the data processing done via 2 volunteer computing projects called BOINC and Folding@home, run by Berkeley and Stanford Universities; These projects encompass many sub projects much of which are also run by International Universities.

The projects that data is processed for, and which is how the coins are created and issued, include Academic and private research projects doing work on various Science, Math, Technology, Climate change, Medical, and many other important projects.

Medical projects including those trying to find cures and doing research on: Aids, TB, Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, Cancer - as well as general Protein folding.

Other science projects include: tracking Asteroids, Modelling climate change, Encryption, Proving/Disproving Mathematical conjectures, and many others.

    https://boinc.berkeley.edu
    https://folding.stanford.edu

Obviously by purchasing and holding (or burning) CureCoin and GridCoin it will decrease supply and increase demand, thereby rising the price - which in turn will then bring in new generations of those looking to 'mine' these coins, later finding out that rather than producing pointless hashes, instead they are actually processing data for important research projects.

In terms of donations, both BOINC and F@H as well as most of the sub projects have a way you can donate, including in some cases by cryptocurrency also.

Anyway, either way, again well done for sharing you good fortune to make the World a better place.";2;0;False;chriscambridge;dr7n7g9;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Fairly unreal of you to do something like this. I work in medical research, specifically stroke prevention, utilizing high resolution MRI imaging to identify potential plaque features that may be predictors of an incoming stroke. We are trying to expand our efforts across the world, currently training and sharing our sequences and findings with multiple sites. 

Stroke prevention research is criminally underfunded, most dollars go to stroke recovery, which is just due to natural human tendencies in my opinion. Seeing a stroke happen, you want to fix it. Preventing one, most people think ""oh eat better, exercise, you'll be fine"" but fail to realize we could be SO much better at predicting  your chances of one, and stopping it in its tracks.

"Hi!  I'd like to put in an idea for the 'Ghost Fishing' organization.  They aim to recover fishing equipment lost at sea that continues to kill marine life that it entangles.  They also work to create more sustainable fishing equipment (biodegradable) so that less damage is caused when these items are lost.

I first learned about it from the Podcast ""Stuff you should know""
https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/ghost-fishing.htm

I am an ocean lover and have chosen this problem as one I would like to see solved in my lifetime.  


>‘Ghost Fishing’ is what fishing gear does when it has been lost, dumped or abandoned. Imagine a fishing net that gets snagged on a reef or a wreck and gets detached from the fishing vessel. Nets, long lines, fish traps or any man made contraptions designed to catch fish or marine organisms are considered capable of ghost fishing when unattended, and without anyone profiting from the catches, they are affecting already depleted commercial fish stocks.

"I am not sure if you would consider a centre in  Ireland. I have always wanted to give something to this charity. https://lauralynn.ie 
The work that this charity does is phenomenal and I have always wished to do something to raise money for them after I saw the owner and one of the families of a very ill child being interviewed on TV. If not, either way what you are doing is amazing. Hats off to you.

Unfortunately, and fortunately, I am new to crypto but hope that someday I can make enough to give something to my own kids but also kids in this charity. This might sound odd but I am fortunate (touch wood) that my children are healthy and hopefully have a long life ahead of them but this charity will definitely get a chunk of any profits from crypto.

"Hey man,

Awesome on giving back, that is amazing. I wanted to let you know about another charity. First of all, I'm going to say I'm sorry for even letting you know about it, because honestly this charity has been in the back of my head for a while and I give to them every month, but not much, only what I can afford right now, but this guy is doing god's work. 

First, I know animal welfare is kind of a taboo discussion, but this guy works to help animals in basically the worst positions on Earth. His name is Marc Ching, he goes to China to help dogs and cats that are involved in the dog meat trade. He also helps other animals in other welfare situations in the 3rd world, like labs, or fur factories. Now this is China.. where animal welfare is basically non existent in the laws.. he is working with the government and trying to bring some kind of order to these places. 

I'm going to say also, I am not a vegetarian and I'm not saying eating meat is bad and all of that. However, what is happening in 3rd world countries honestly is kind of unreal, and extremely traumatizing.

In the dog meat trade, animals are literally tortured because it is believed it makes the meat more ""tender"" or something and therefore more healing. 

When I say torture, I mean like, straight out of a horror movie torture, like boiled alive, skin ripped off alive, burned, gagged, banged on the head. I can't even watch the videos, they make me completely sick to my stomach and it is just a complete travesty of everything humanity stands for. Even the fur trade stuff with foxes, man it is so unreal and so sad on every level, like straight up ripping the skin off before they even are dead. why? :(

Like I said, I'm not vegan or against meat if it's ethical, lbut I mean, to straight up torture animals before death is like, fucking unreal man, unreal

Our boy, /u/vernetroyer/ made a video about them. Verne, is there anyway you can reply to this post and talk about how this charity impacted you? I know it touched me a lot too, you can see the video he made here where he visited the guy: https://animalhopeandwellness.org/vern-troyer-speaks-about-saving-dogs-from-the-asian-dog-meat-trade/ 

Now, please, if you feel like you might get sick from watching this videos, or can't stand it, I suggest not watching it at all. I literally can not watch them anymore, I felt so bad afterwards, I really mean that, if you like cats or dogs, this is unreal what is going on over there. You can see their facebook here though: https://www.facebook.com/animalhopeandwellness/

Anyway, me personally I'm working on business stuff and it is on my list to one day be able to donate as much money as I can to this guy. He never says no to helping animals. He actually brings the animals back to America when he can and gets them adopted here too.

I feel bad even posting this and writing about it. I know it will make other people sick to their stomach, and I feel bad when it is such a negative thing, but I read this post from my phone while I was out before and I knew I had to try to make this post. 

Even if you can't donate a lot, anything would be helpful for this guy, I only give a small amount, wish the impact could be more though.

"These people are looking for a vaccine for T1 Diabetics to help them produce their own insulin.  
http://www.faustmanlab.org   
My GF is a T1 and she stopped doing all the donation walks because most of those companies only research for new treatment methods (injection methods, monitoring devices, ect), not an actual cure.  
It looks like this company is trying for an actual cure that would save people thousands a year.  
As a baseline, my GF is a T1 and she spends hundreds a month on testing supplies / insulin to inject. She will max out her insurance premiums in less than half a year ($2500) so after that her insurance pays for everything for the rest of the year. Which is amazing, but also a huge cost and can be a huge burden to a lot of people if they don't have anyone else to help pay for stuff.  
So donating to a company that is finding a cure would make her day.  

Or just donate to my GF because I love her :) (and we would use it for a wedding / honeymoon)

"What about the ALS foundation? I lost my father back in July to a rare form of ALS. They just do not have nearly enough research on ALS in general let alone the rare forms of it. He only lasted six months from diagnosis. I moved them into my house and took best care of him as I could to make him comfortable but there literally was nothing that anybody could do. The form of ALS that he had was called bulbar onset.

There is no treatment no nothing that they can do.

[Camp Kita](http://campkita.com)    

Here is our vision statement:   

To provide a safe, nurturing environment where child survivors can connect with one another while learning constructive ways to deal with the often unspeakable and fierce emotion of losing a parent to suicide. By creating a space for child survivors, we effectively ease the stigma around what it means to have lost a parent to suicide. The campers’ shared loss and experience grants them the opportunity to form deep, knowing bonds with others and thereby forging supportive connections that we hope will last a lifetime. As a community of survivors, our week-long focus will be to provide and explore constructive forms of self-expression. We will practice self-awareness as a way of identifying feelings and communicating them in a focused way.  Our focus on grief—on shattering apart—will dovetail with an equally significant focus on hope—the power and purpose of piercing oneself together. Most importantly, we will empower campers to utilize the tools and resources we provide so that they may draw upon them throughout their lives.";1;0;False;tombloomingdale;dr6z6i5;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I'd like to recommend a small UK charity, run by a good friend of mine, called The Horse Course.

They intervene when troubled, at-risk children with behavioral issues are not responding to traditional therapy or counseling. The problem with these types of treatments is that a lot of the kids that need them most are simply not willing or able to communicate their problems verbally. They ""Shut down"" and disengage, and the therapy goes nowhere. 

When you replace the therapist with an animal, who responds keenly to the vibes you give out without the baggage of dealing with another human being, suddenly these kids find it a lot easier to communicate, understand and fix their behavioral problems.

The charity is regarded as a leader in evidence-based evaluations of their performance - i.e, in delivering actual results; in young offenders, they achieved a 28% reduction in re-offending. There is an extensive evidence base, including endorsements from academics and the like, on their website.

They operate on a very thin margin and a donation could make a huge difference on how many therapies they are able to deliver.

You can find them here: www.thehorsecourse.org . I hope you decide they are a worthwhile cause, they are brilliant and I have seen them change lives for the better firsthand!

"Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://www.maps.org/). They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.

MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.

In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.

"Many important causes already. Definitely I'm seconding FSF or here in europe FSFE and OpenStreetMap.

Close to my heart is VR on a free software stack. VR is going to be an important technology for the future and currently if you want to do almost anything with VR on PCs, you need a proprietary stack like, windows, Oculus SDK or SteamVR, Unity or Unreal Engine. Far too few people care, but for the future we absolutely need a free software stack.

OpenHMD is reverse engineering HMDs and other VR hardware and writing open source drivers for it. They have a bitcoin donation link, but better check with them before sending a larger sum. http://www.openhmd.net/. It's a relatively small project, but there are people who are part of Khronos' OpenXR group around.

"Hello,

I just want to say first off, this is what keeps the community as a whole healthy and not only are you doing good in the world you're also giving bitcoin a good name. Thank you for doing something like this.

My brother had cancer when he was younger and he's since recovered but we were invited to children's cancer camp to help the children with cancer cope and relate to people who are going through the same circumstances as themselves. The siblings of the kids also get to come because often times the siblings don't receive as much attention (when your brother's life is on the line you often feel neglected and it's hard to cope for younger kids who don't quite understand selflessness yet). I was invited when i was 15, 9 years ago. I've gone every year since then, volunteer as a counselor for the past 6 years.

The camp is called Camp Sunrise & Sidekicks and was funded by the American Cancer Society. 4 years ago the American Cancer Society reallocated all funds towards only cancer research and we lost funding. The directors of the camp whom have been volunteers for 30+ years started a new foundation to continue the camp called Southwest Kids Cancer Foundation.

The camp is still going strong but since losing funding we've had to cut down a lot of what we used to do. The camp is growing in numbers still and we're always trying to get sponsors and donations to keep up. It would be a blessing to receive any sort of donation and if not i still appreciate what you're doing.

"Oo! [Aubrey de Grey did an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7i9vrj/this_is_aubrey_im_starting_the_ama_now_and_i/) not long ago! The SENS Foundation is small right now (at least compared to the big guys like the Red Cross), so that kind of money would make a huge difference in their ledger. Here's a video explaining what they're about: [Rejuvenation Biotechnology: The Fourth Age of Gerontology - Aubrey de Grey - RB2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CWkb2gObg0) (19min 53sec).

Tl;Dr: It's a new area of study in medicine: Repairing the damage from the process of aging itself before it gets to the point of pathology and disease. We could live healthier for longer. Aging affects all of us, so any research into this area helps all of us.

Aubrey de Grey is the ""face of the organization"" as it were, and gives talks about the basic principals a lot. He's been doing these talks for some years, the way he explains it makes sense, and he seems invested in making this successful - a great talk to listen to! 

Aubrey has categorized looking at the problem like this: - Altering metabolism to prevent damage from occurring. This is difficult, because metabolism is a complicated system and you can't expect to find a simple solution. - Dealing with the diseases of aging after the damage has led to pathology. This is how gerontology currently works, with treating things like Alzheimer and whatnot. - Repair the damage as it accumulates, like doing preventative maintenance on a car. This is what he's putting the most emphasis on. Currently not many people are researching in this area, and therefore needs more people addressing it, and is what the SENS Foundation focuses on.

Aubrey says what he sees as the 7 types of damage that accumulates over time, and that by categorizing them like that, it breaks the problem into something manageable. They are: Cell loss/cell atrophy, division -obsessed cells, death-resistant cells, mitochondrial mutations, intracellular waste products, extracellular waste products, and extracellular matrix stiffening.

Besides that, nice picks, dude! :D The EFF have been on my mind lately, as I'm figuring they're gonna be the big guns going to court to have the FCC's decision overturned if they vote for Pai's plan tomorrow.

"Please donate to any number of the organizations fighting to end drug prohibition in the United States.


The drug war and the prison industrial complex that has been built upon it has ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and cost the lives of untold more due to violence from the cartels that prohibition props up; or cost the lives of those who have been unable to benifit from marijuana medicinal uses (such as CBD oil to resolve seizures or pain relief), and are forced to use other much more dangerous and addictive drugs.


Just to quote the most insane statistic.
In the last 30+ years our prison population has gone from 300,000, to over 1 million. With 80% of those incarcerated for simply the possession of marijuana.
This disproportionate effects the poor and minorities and rips families apart.


On top of this the taxes can be used to fund schools, and we know how desperately they need it.

Without electricity, fridges will stop working, gas stations won't pump gas, farming will break down.  In short, our civilization could end.

The American military, and a Congressional EMP task force has investigated this, and admits the risks are real.  Help harden our electric grid.  When an EMP happens, god forbid, you could be responsible for saving millions of American lives.  Please feel free to ask me for further resources, ask any questions, or I can even put you in touch with patriotic and highly qualified Americans who have dedicated their life to this issue.  

PS.  no electricity, no bitcoin.

"I would love if you found a way to donate to any of the refugee-related international charities, such as [The International Rescue Committee](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwilk9vF4ofYAhVl_4MKHQwNBR8QFgg1MAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rescue.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw3ALF_-yMh6NNzIkO9KrHfD) or the [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/).

There is an incredible number of refugees and the United States is largely closing their borders to them. For reference, last year the budget was for 110,000 refugees. This year, President Trump has cut that to 45,000. However, because of several Executive Orders and bans, that number is only on pace to be about 15,000.

We have a lot of refugees in my area who are trying to reunite with their families. These are people who have spent years trying to track down family members in other countries, have spent multiple years going through all the vetting and processes, who are no longer going to be able to have their family members join them. It's heart-breaking, because many of them are new but now their families won't be able to follow them. In addition, President Trump also ended a program that allowed legal immigrants to bring their children (under 18) into the United States from Central America.

All of this was done in the name of national security and counter-terrorism. Which is sad, because out of the 3.2 million refugees resettled here since 1975, only 3 Americans were killed from terrorist acts, and there's no evidence to say they were brought here for that purpose, as some were brought here as children. These are the most vulnerable people in the world, and we have a system already in place that properly vets them and filters out bad actors. However, this program is being scaled back over 80% in just one year.

My wife works with these refugees and would be happy to share more information with you if you would like. We could both tell you stories about the things the refugees have told us and what their lives were like in the refugee camps. Some of them walk off a plane into the United States after not having electricity or running water for sometimes up to 15 years. Some of them are college-educated who have to take manual labor jobs because none of their education transfers here, but they do it because they love their family so much and will do anything to provide a good life for them. These people possess the greatest American spirit, willing to do anything to work hard for their family. They are really inspirational.

"Hi there. This is incredibly generous of you. I foolishly sold my btc for what now looks like a hilariously paltry sum a few years ago. This is an incredible idea and I'm sure many people will benefit. 


I was going to suggest a donation to the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). OMF is working to develop a cure for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a misunderstood disease that affects an estimated 17 million people and often leaves them unable to work. 25% of those people are so sick they're unable to leave their bed. 


This time last year, I was working a full time job, recently having completed a purchase of my first property, going to the gym 3/4 times a week, and generally enjoying life. Then I caught a virus which I never recovered from. Fast forward to now, and I've been living with my parents since then, who are my primary carers. I rely on them to cook for me, help take me to doctors appointments, and help me with going up and down stairs. 


The reason I have to rely on my parents for this, is because I suffer from an extreme feeling of illness all day. Imagine having the flu, but constantly, day after day, month after month. In addition, I get dizzy if I sit upright, feel more sick if I spend too long doing cognitively 'complicated' things like watching tv or reading. My muscles are severely weak, and I get frequent joint paint. I have to rest, with no stimulus, for hours every day, to even be able to be on speaking terms with my parents. When people visit they're surprised to see me able to talk and seem 'normal', but what they don't see is that after they leave I feel horrifically ill as a consequence. 


My story is not unusual among those with this disease. We are, by and large, left alone by the medical profession and left to fend for ourselves, with a poor prognosis and scant hope of recovery. There is no universally suitable or effective treatment. OMF relies on charitable donations to survive, and has assembled a world-class teams of scientists to cure this horrific illness. 

All the best to you, and I hope you consider them as a worthy beneficiary of your donation.

I would highly encourage you to take a look at this foundation. 

I think it's something that can really benefit mankind and reduce suffering. If you ignore the immortality, the core of the research is to remove the suffering of ageing not actually stop it. But one of the side effects of curing diseases associated with ageing is that you tend to live longer. 

What you are doing is truly remarkeable and selfless in itself so you should be very proud but I implore you consider this foundation as I believe it's a huge investment in everyone's future.

"Please fund DRACO research.

**\#EndTheVirus**

*Some history:* before the antibiotic was discovered, bacterial infections were usually a death sentence. People with syphilis would die horrible painful deaths, and things like the Bubonic Plague spread like wildfire unstoppably killing masses of people.

Then the antibiotic was discovered, and now most bacterial infections are easily treatable with a regimen of pills or a shot.

BUT viral infections STILL have no cure.

Whether it be the common cold, or herpes or HIV, we can only treat the symptoms, and not actually cure the body.

BUT DRACO changes all of this.

It is the ANTIBIOTIC to viruses.

In short, it can induce cell-apoptosis on all cells with double-stranded RNA (which is produced ONLY by viruses, and is NOT normally produced by cells not infected with a virus).

This has the potential to cure ANY virus-caused disease, whether it be the common cold, or even HIV.

**tl;dr: bacterial infections were ended by the antibiotic. DRACO can bring an end to virus infections.**

In my opinion, this is possibly the MOST GROUND-BREAKING recent discovery in the medical field.

However, they are getting [barely any funding](http://www.process.org/discept/2011/11/17/draco-death-to-the-virus/)

> We’ve really struggled along for the past 11 years, barely getting enough funding to stay alive.

Those who need large quantities daily, such as those suffering from epilepsy or cancer are especially in need of support. Additionally, there are many parents across the US who would like to move to states that offer legal access to their child's medication but simply can not afford to move, forcing them to rely on ineffective pharmaceuticals or to break the law (in some cases at great risk to their own safety and freedom). ;1;0;False;mrsegraves;dr7baof;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Effective altruism is a movement that is aimed to find, evaluate and support most effective charities.

"Spend 1% to hire some people to do the charity research for you. EFF, Khan, it's all great, but it's a power law distribution and they are getting 90% of donations.  Because marketing, and it's hard to find smaller charities who you can trust. It takes time and can be risky. But it's very possible that with a little research they can have much bigger impact for the same money. GiveWell does something like that but I would suggest  trying on your own. If you do, please post the results on the fund site or here.

You probably could find reasonable people in academic circles to do the research for you .It's a hard  problem and I know you want to donate money not time, but it may be worth it.

Rock on.

edit. In case you need to convert your BTC to USD before donating somewhere, ask some exchange for 0% fee cooperation. They will very likely do it for publicity and these fees matter with this kind of money.

"Sustainable food systems are important! There are several organizations that work to support farmers, researchers, educators, eaters, builders: folks throughout the food system engaged in transitioning farms to more sustainable/ecological/holistic practices. Here are a couple:

- National Center for Appropriate Technology: https://www.ncat.org/ ATTRA is the NCAT relevant sustainable agriculture subproject.
- Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research: http://foundationfar.org/ A result of the 2014 Farm Bill, the goal is to fund ag research and involves matching govt. funding.
- Ecological Farming Association: https://eco-farm.org/ Mostly focused on providing educational resources smaller-scale California farmers.
- Land grant university cooperative extension agencies do incredible work, not sure if it meets your criteria, but might be worth looking into as well, list available here: https://nifa.usda.gov/land-grant-colleges-and-universities-partner-website-directory?state=All&type=Extension

There are also many groups with much more focused interests such as soil health, regenerative growing practices, food policy work, programs for environmental stewardship, farm to school etc. Some work at the very-local level, others have chapters all all over the world.

If you need a closer/broader look to identify specific organizations (even outside of those listed) doing work in sustainable food that align with your donation priorities, let me know and I'd be happy to help.

Bonus links, environmental/conservation groups:

- The Nature Conservancy: https://www.nature.org
- National Resources Defense Council: https://www.nrdc.org

"I don't know if this will reach your interest, but there is a great group of people helping poor people in Kosovo. Yeah you heard that right, Kosovo in South East Europe :)

So the project is called [Jam for the Cow](https://www.facebook.com/Jam-per-Lopen-170035566413651/) (Jam per lopen in Albanian), different artists (bands/singers) play for free for a concert, usually once a year, some painters give their paintings as donation on auction and similar giveaways and all the money raised is basically buying a cow or two for different poor families living in rural areas in Kosovo. Latest concert raised for 2 cows and fixing a roof for a house.

Here's a short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFJZB3iNFGY

"Please donate to the excellent researchers that are researching chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a relatively common life-destroying illness that strikes young people for which until recently, very little research funding was allocated by funding bodies like the US National Institutes of Health. 

To put it into perspective, until recently the NIH allocated about $5 million per annuum to this illness for the last 20 years, which is peanuts. Compared to CFS, there are about half as many people with multiple sclerosis, and the disease has a similar suffering and disability profile, and gets about $100 million per annuum. In other words, the ratio of dollars spent per patient is shockingly low.

The good news is, there is new awareness about the illness (see the documentary [Unrest](https://www.unrest.film/) for example). The [NIH very recently also opened up CFS research centers](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-announces-centers-myalgic-encephalomyelitis-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-research) and other countries are also showing signs of wanting to solve this problem.

Unfortunately, the research funding continues to be too low to make any real progress. The current system in place works well for diseases that are somewhat understood (you need funding to make progress, and results to get funding, and it's hard to get results with a poorly understood illness while having too little funding, and researchers tend to go where the funding is, etc.). What we need is to give this research a push with an infusion of money. If you could donate a million or more it would help tremendously. Many patients are already donating but there's only so much sick and disabled people can do.

I can recommend several excellent research teams that will use donations wisely:

The [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo/).

The [Cornell Center for Enervating NeuroImmune Disease](http://neuroimmune.cornell.edu/).

The [Columbia Center for Infection and Immunity](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/center-infection-and-immunity)(specify that the donation is for CFS).

The [Unutmaz Lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-unutmaz-lab) at the Jackson laboratory (specify that the donation is for CFS).

Hi there, I don't know an exact charity but donating to something that is working to push humanity itself forward I think would be a worthy investment.

"Hi!

Can I recommend the Internet Archive? (archive.org)

Among other things the Archive hosts the Wayback Machine, which is of infinite value generally speaking as a cultural history of the web, but in the recent political climate has also been a mechanism for preserving an invaluable record some are trying to redact.

Beyond the famous Wayback Machine,

 the Archive (a California library) is also involved in massive-scale book scanning and lending, both with Open Library and the current Open Libraries initiative to bring _all_ libraries onine;

the TV News project, recording and making searchable television news from dozens of markets and countries 24/7,  making television news a citable medium and subjecting it to large scale analysis, e.g. to track the appearance of political advertisements as they flow through different markets;

the Great 78s and other music projects including hosting eTree, the passionate live music taper community, including about every known recording of bands like the Grateful Dead, as well as many net labels, podcasts, etc.,

and on and on.

Additionally the Archive is an ally of the EFF and has been at the forefront of supporting the decentralized and open internet.

The Archive is a non-profit entirely supported by donations, including from individuals.

Look at helping some of the homeless population or see if you can get the ball rolling on whatever is closest to your heart & your geographical location.

I'm not super well off, but definitely not homeless. There isn't a greater feeling to me than helping / trying to help people that can't even afford a sleeping bag or a pillow. 

Don't forget the majority of these folks that are homeless have mental illness, some don't of course. But I know where I'm from over the last 20 years they have drastically defunded mental illness rehabilitation and closed down many hospitals. Those people are forced onto the streets & then they are forced into the drug cycle. It's sad, we often forget those affected around us.

"Great initiative. In fact it is my hope for more super wealthy individuals to come forward bootstrapping science, research, humanitarian development etc where necessary. And I have more hope on us nerds than the super wealthy from the old age :-)

Here's my suggestions:

**1) [Machine intelligence research Institute](https://intelligence.org/research/)** 

If you are not already mixed up between euphoria and existencial terror regarding AI, I'd suggest you to read [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) essay. In fact, I'd prefer you to check out that essay instead of further reading this post, if you have to choose. It had a similarly huge impact on me as when I first dived into Bitcoin.

**2) [Parsemus Foundation](https://www.parsemus.org/)**

Medical research, their project with the most attention being a cheap longterm reversible male contraception. If humanity survives 1) we'll need this soon :-)

**3) ""Opensource CPU and Hardware""**

Sorry no link, maybe someone can chime in here. Intel and AMD CPUs contain microcontrollers with closed source software and access to memory, data and networking interfaces. An can't safely and securely be deactivated. As we need open source operation systems and software, we need open source hardware too. It's a disaster waiting to happen, and maybe alreay happening behind closed doors for years. There's [Talos](https://www.crowdsupply.com/raptor-computing-systems/talos-secure-workstation) building a POWER8 open hardware computer, but I don't know what state they are at nor if they are an NGO or ""just"" a for-profit company. I'd consider this a first-world luxury problem, compared to 1) and 2) though.

**4) [The PENG! collective]( https://pen.gg/campaigns)**

They use clever media campaigns to fight the big guys. Like for example

* staging a peace prize ceremony for one of the biggest weapons exporters

* getting into a young-researchers competition by Shell, then ""exploding"" their machine live on stage spilling oil everywhere, shutting down the complete competition

* dropping flyers over NSA headquarters, billboards in view of the bureaus with ""intel exit""

and a dozen more. It easily takes 6 months and more to prepare for those campaigns. I am in awe of their clever and funny campaigns, and how they engage right at the biggest supercorporations, national states and intelligence agencies. They are not exactly saving humanity as a whole, but work on making world a bit less evil. I think a donation with a fraction of your regular donations would help them out big time already.

Well, what more can I say than ""thank you for doing your part"". :-)";26;2;False;ente_;dr6tzi0;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

"Anytime you put in more than you're willing to lose, it's a risk. I agree with this. 

I also agree that bitcoin is MORE RISKY than a generic diversified portfolio. No argument there. 

The problem is comparing it to casino gambling (provably -EV) or saying that ""if it hits (100k or 250k) then our entire government's financial system will collapse."" That's extremely negligent analysis based on zero evidence. These arbitrary psychological barriers are what cause panic sells.

Yes it is a big problem if people are investing so much that their lives are ruined if the price goes down.

"I decided to write this a few days ago concerning BTC and other cryptocurrencies, enjoy the read and if you have questions about it, feel free to ask: Also like and share this article if you enjoy the read!

Between the years of 1634 and 1637 there was a similar phenomenon to our modern-day Bitcoin (BTC) that we are currently experiencing. It was known as Tulip Mania where the Dutch blew up the price of this flower because of the rarity of it and the increased demand. In one month, the prices inflated just over 2,000% and people were given anything and everything they owned to get a piece of the action. Again, we are seeing something similar with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, but what protected the Dutch and what is protecting us today with these prices? The answer: nothing at all.

Sure, even I have jumped on the bandwagon of buying and selling these currencies and have enjoyed every minute of it, but just as Tulip Mania, we are eventually going to face this infamous “bubble” that major economists are rambling on about. Tulips at their initial release to the Dutch community became a luxury item, where bulbs were being sold at almost 10x what a normal laborer was making during that period. You are certainly seeing something similar with BTC and other coins and the growth that is happening daily. Many are projecting BTC to reach into the million-dollar mark for a single BTC, which at that point even the wealthiest 10% in the world can’t even afford. 

We have reached the point that the tulip market reached in November of 1636, futures are starting to be offered on BTC and guess what followed 3 months later? The most abrupt “bubble” popping and a complete market crash. Community members had sold of their homes, livestock, and even the last few bucks they had to their name to acquire these tulips. As the market for BTC continues to grow, even the most basic individuals are putting their minimum wage checks into these exchanges and wallets in hopes of striking it rich, just as their predecessors have done in the past and are currently doing. Apparently, the world never learned from Tulip Mania or the great depression, where people lost everything because they were putting their money in places without any security and ultimately lost every bit of their monetary lives. Maybe it could be put into a simpler comparison of what bitcoin is. 

If you have a smart phone, you most likely have downloaded games such as candy crush or clash of clans with those pesky in app purchases for their “currencies.” Probably wondering where I am going with this and you might already know what is being implied. All you have is some in-app currency that you get to play with daily and make a few bucks on, but, it’s just a game. Some guy that literally nobody knows, created some currency and got a lot of people to believe in it, but not really. People purchase these coins and then sell them to get their everyday fiat money in return. If you truly believe in these currencies, why are you not holding on to them and why can’t you spend them at your neighborhood market? All everyone is doing, is making this guy “Satoshi” extremely rich and whenever this guy decides that he’s had enough and the game is over; he just goes “click” and shuts everything done and has ultimately schemed everyone out of trillions of dollars and everyone is left looking at a computer screen with no money in their bank account and wondering what they are going to do going forward. 

So, if you are going to get into the game, make sure you know what you are doing and have a plan to get out. You may think I am being a hypocrite because I myself have bought into this, but I have also received my initial investment back and just playing profits. I want everyone to have fun and make a little bit of extra money, but if you believe that this will ultimately take over currencies around the world, you have another thing coming. Until “Satoshi” comes forward, there is public backing of these coins, and the market accepts it everywhere; be careful and invest wisely. Until then, you are playing the ultimate game of monopoly and “Satoshi” owns all 32 homes on the board.

"Speaking of Coinbase fees.. you might consider minimizing coinbase fee PERCENTAGE, by buying the max for a particular fee. They are in $1 increments... so, for example:
$1 fee:  up to $200 (so $1 fee if you buy $10, or $200)
$2 fee:  $201-301
$3 fee:  $302-402
$4 fee:  $403-503
$5 fee:  $504-604
and so on... you get the idea..

"> it simply questions the level of certainly in knowledge gained through the empirical study of economics alone.


Nobody in mainstream economics says we should only use empirical data. OBVIOUSLY something must be rationally true in order to be empirically true, but I must say, if something appears to be rationally true but empirically it cannot be demonstrated to be true (as with much Austrian theory), it doesn't mean anything and isn't worth being taken as true.

And that is the main problem with Austrians, sure maybe they do some empirical work, but overwhelmingly they will not discard their praxeology if data suggests it is not true.

>Their issue is that, unlike with the hard sciences, many observations in economics lack the possibility of a control or repeatability, bringing an unknown level of uncertainty to your results.

I believe you mean social science, nobody calls economics a hard science.

">I highly doubt I would be able to agree with this causality. Maybe you could point to a textbook to support your argument, and I could definitely point to a textbook saying the opposite. And none of our pointing would actually prove anything.

Economics is highly polarized along political lines but one of the few things there is close to a consensus on in economics is that monetary deflation triggered the Great Depression as a result of the Fed not being able to issue more currency because of the limits of the gold standard, more specifically it turned an ordinary recession into the Great Depression.

If I point you to an economist who backs up what I say you can accuse me of cherry picking and bias so just google ""causes of the great depression"" and then read a variety of sources and you can validate this for yourself.

>Again, I point to the entirely of the 18th, 19th and 20th century. Even IF the Great Depression was caused by the gold standard, the economy overall was up MASSIVELY. So the weight of evidence we've discussed at this point is in my favor. i.e. the evidence that gold is not disastrous.

That was because of the industrial revolution, not because of the gold standard. If the gold standard was responsible for that level of economic growth then we would have seen every country that went off the gold standard take a significant hit in economic growth, which isn't what happened.

Economic growth increased after we got off the gold standard which is if not evidence it was holding us back is at least evidence that fiat isn't any worse.

"Unregulated? You seem to have confused some terms.

ISPs won't regulate the Internet but just the part of infrastructure that belongs to them. And that is perfectly OK, because it's their property. They rent the infrastructure to customers by mutually voluntary contract and customers may accept their offer or refuse it and not subscribe.

The ""neutrality"" **is a government regulation** that puts limits on the use of property by ISPs. An artificial limit on use of your own property, as long as you don't use it to cause harm to others, sounds like unpleasant thing, doesn't it? I'd say it's plainly immoral.

The root of the problem is that ISP market has been regulated. To provide Internet to customers one has to apply for licenses, permits, provide data retention or wiretapping backdoors and comply with a set of government requirements. That creates monopolies or oligopolies where providers don't compete for customers by offering better and cheaper services, just because the government limits protect their market positions from new competitors. (I don't know the specific situation in US, so please forgive vague terms, but I'm pretty sure the ISP market isn't free there.)

So, to cure problems caused by one regulation (of the ISP market) the government will create another regulation (Neutrality) instead of abolishing the former. Over years that will create a pile of legal acts that everyone will have to comply with. This raises costs, which will be reflected in internet access prices. Also, it will cause pathological situations in many places just because the government isn't omniscient and regulations don't apply well to all possible situations.";1;0;False;e-mess;dr5t17y;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!
