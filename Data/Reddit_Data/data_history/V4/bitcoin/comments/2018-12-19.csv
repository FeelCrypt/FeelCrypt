That legitimately sounds awesome.  I have two questions:

1) How do you pay off your CC with BTC?  Did you find a bank that lets you do this, or do you sell on an exchange, transfer to your checking account, and pay the CC?

2) Who does your taxes?

">That sounds great until you realize you bought €500 worth of bitcoin last month to spend on Christmas gifts and now you only have enough to buy €275 worth of gifts

But I didn't ""buy €500 worth of bitcoin to spend on Christmas gifts"".  I ""sold all my euro for bitcoin to spend on everything that I want/need to spend money on"".

It's true that between earning it and spending it, the volatility can mean I lose out a bit of purchasing power.  That has indeed happened throughout most of 2018.  But since most of 2017 involved having more purchasing power later in the month, it pretty much evens out (and looks quite positive over the longer timescale).

"There are a few ways, really.

1) Presume 3 month bear market (general consensus). Sell a small chunk (5%) for Cash, rebuy at depressed prices. Go back to all-in Feb, March. I do this and profit handsomely (like 40% BTC to BTC returns this year - obviously I should have done it more, earlier).

2) Diversify for spot plays. Privacy coins are good at tax time (I got some Monero & BTCP). ETH has some potential (IMO). Maybe it goes from 27 to 22, but issuance is getting a 40% haircut in 1 month. Make of that what you will. If market goes south, I got some BTCP as my hedge. It takes a *very* small amount of marketing to make BTCP pop - I speculate some big man will buy in, and try to corner the market.

3) Go 5x in March at good price. If price is like $2,500 come March, I will gladly go 5x leveraged, if I can.

But these are all plays. I'm Long BTC and keep most my money in that, if these plays hit I get 100% profit, but only on 5% of capital. Confidence is low, but profit potential immense.

The only serious move I'm doing is a play into ETH. I might regret it if bear market continues until March, but by June either ETH will have completely died (don't foresee this) or the reduced issuance will pump price, sharply. That's the only play I *strongly* recommend to casuals is to have *some* ETH prior to the 40% issuance cut, with a hold period of 'till June. Or BTCP is you like to gamble.

I do something else with another coin, but too complex to go into.";2;1;False;Bitcoin1776;ec4bojg;Here we go again! Upvote to gain momentum! To the Moon! <3;a7ln25;https://i.redd.it/hul5q64x08521.gif
"Sort of true, and not. At some point you got to express your wealth. Living frugal is great (I do), but if the economy downturns you are equally vulnerable as if you had borrowed debt.

Say you are a millionaire. Let's say your car is $5,000 & furnishings $5,000. Let's say *others* are at $20,000 - this is peer group, not millionaire to millionaire.

Now economy goes south for 5 years before recovery. Now you still have more investment than peer group, but it's like $500,000. You now have trouble creating new connections as you are judged as someone worth $50,000. Everyone knows the economy is bad, but you show it. Now upon recovery you've spent 5 years with depressed marketing potential, because you refused to upgrade when opportunity knocked.

Better is time market correctly (best you can), and upgrade at said time to meet (or slightly exceed) peers. Project yourself 5 years out, what are your minimum tastes, in terms of assets?

Now economy crashes, but you have $10,000 of new things to show for it - doesn't take much to impress the poor. Now you look like you were unaffected by the crash, either smart and profited or so rich you didn't give a shit. Now opportunity arises to 'buy the dip'.

You now got $20,000 of goods to use as collateral for loans (potentially), etc, etc. Generically, no matter how much wealth you have, I suggest expressing 5% of it in hard assets. A millionaire with less than $50,000 in furnishings, car, house, etc is *leveraged*, not frugal, IMO.

In particular my hard asset is owning a business, which is a rather substantial sum of capital I cannot easily liquidate even if I wanted to. I have absolutely 0% expectation ownership of the business will provide more than Bitcoin, but I can't liquidate so... but I could loan against, if desired to. I also upgraded my life *reasonably* during the Bitcoin boom, took a vacation, etc. I'm not in *lifestyle debt* or whatever you may call it.

Despite what Millionaire next door teaches, etc. I find it better to invest in yourself to some extent relative to wealth. I also invest in the extended children of my family, buying them computers, teaching them to code etc. Just because the market crashes for 5 years (pretend), doesn't mean I can tell the kids to stop growing - and it's far more profitable to grow kids properly than to be so leveraged that they suffer. Sure you say, in 5 years they will thank you, but even though this is not *technically* debt, it creates a similar outcome.

"Nothing. That's the problem. In that regard, cryptocurrency is still in the same place that it was when I first got interested in it almost a decade ago. It's a technology with interesting potential applications that still hasn't found a mainstream purpose.

But sometimes it takes time and a technology requires other technologies to be developed before it finds its purpose. The touch screen was invented like 50 years ago. It started appearing on some ATMs in the late 80s. Then, it made its way onto PDAs in the late 90s. Finally, it become a central technology on a ubiquitous device -- the smartphone -- in the late 2000s. It was thanks to advances in microprocessor tech, digital storage and battery and display technology that it became so central to people's lives.

From a conceptual standpoint, cryptocurrency and the concept of a blockchain only becomes more interesting IMO as our lives become more digitized as it's the only technology that gives digital ""goods"" properties of physical goods without the need for trusting a third party.

We're still in the early days though of move from living in the physical world to living in a digital one.

"Past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes*

You essentially have a lot of people that got lucky on an investment, and now think they understand the complexity of markets. It’s important imo to understand that BTC is not a diverse market, it’s a single asset, that not only can fail, but absolutely will eventually. There is absolutely no benefit to holding through a long term downward trend. You should not ever be investing in anything without first having a strategy that includes reasoned projections, and an entry and exit point. 

That said, I picked up 5% today, and typically average a 1 - 2% gain weekly, so I’m not too pessimistic, I just hate seeing people throw money away on inapplicable investment aphorisms that they don’t understand. It’s really sad, because crypto in general is a great tool for learning how to invest wisely due to the low barrier to entry. You can put 100$ on any exchange and apply whatever investment strategy your learning, as you sharpen your analytics. If you’re using a 1 - 2 % stoploss, it’ll last you quite a while even if you lose every position, and in that time you’ll gain real understanding if you’re studying and applying a consistent back tested strategy.";1;0;False;KanyeTrump2020;ec2yf7c;Real scenario.

">Only if you think Bitcoin is as addictive as drugs and alcohol

Hi, my name is Dale and I use occasionally illegal recreational drugs for a variety of reasons - including just ""having fun"".  I'm not addicted to any of them.

The fact that some drugs are addictive has very little to do with the overall demand for illegal drugs.  While there are some drugs that have a strong ""addict"" customer base (e.g. heroin, cocaine, and meth), there are many others that are popular, sell very well, and the majority of the customers are not addicts (LSD, MDMA, 2CB, etc).

>The mechanisms behind Gold are a bit more complicated, as it has tangible value.

This argument is very tired and very wrong.  Gold's market value has nothing to do with its potential non-monetary uses.

">Imaginary coins are ALL imaginary

All money is imaginary.  It's worth what people are willing to give you for it.

That doesn't mean it's useless or valueless.  Imaginary money is extremely useful and valuable.  This is really no different to language.  Words are just ""made up sounds"".  They only mean what we agree with each other that they mean.  They're totally imaginary in exactly the same way.  Language is one of the most useful inventions people have created.

>There is NO utility

This is untrue.

Bitcoin's utility is the ability to send money from one place to another without requiring a middleman, completely pseudonymously, and increasingly irreversibly over time.  If you see no value in that, fine, but *very* many people do.

>Bolivars and $ are backed by their respective governments.

True.  They are backed by the threat of violence.  Note that I'm not actually saying that's necessarily a bad thing, it's just a statement of fact.  It's not without practicality to have a currency that you are required to consider valuable, because it forces your neighbour to consider it valuable as well and gives you a reasonable expectation of the ability to trade.  However, just because a system works (or better said, ""kind of"" works), it doesn't mean it's the best system.

">Hi, my name is Dale and I use occasionally illegal recreational drugs for a variety of reasons - including just ""having fun"". I'm not addicted to any of them.

Hi Dale. I don't mean this to sound insulting, but isn't that what every addict says until they try to stop using drugs and realize they can't? Addiction isn't caused just by drugs. It's wiring in the brain formed through a reward feedback loop. Anything that produces pleasure can become addictive with enough misuse. It's just that some things, like drugs, cause addictions to form faster. You'll find that, over time, your brain will learn that ""having fun"" through the low energy act of taking a drug will outweigh virtually all other more long-term productive forms. That's my take, anyways. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope you say ok.

> The fact that some drugs are addictive has very little to do with the overall demand for illegal drugs. 

Sure it does. Price is a function of supply and demand. Hypothetically, if we made supply equal for all drugs and made them all legal, the only factor would be demand, and that's based on how much people want a particular drug. Yes, addiction isn't the only factor into why someone wants a drug...but it's a massive part of demand. People don't typically buy alcohol because it's a good antiseptic. They buy it because when they consume it, it makes them feel good for a short time, at the expensive of their long term happiness. If all drugs were legalized tomorrow, I'd bet we'd see a lot more demand for the more addictive drugs than for, say, pot, even though pot may have some other beneficial uses.

>This argument is very tired and very wrong. Gold's market value has nothing to do with its potential non-monetary uses.

">I don't mean this to sound insulting, but isn't that what every addict says until they try to stop using drugs and realize they can't?

What kind of timeframe is necessary to say I've ""stopped"" from your perspective?  Currently, I use mind-altering substances (to the extent that I'm clearly 'under the influence') around 3 to 4 times per year.  When my wife was pregnant (both times), I didn't use anything from 6 months before birth to 6 months after, so that I was always in a fit state of mind in case of any emergency.  From my perspective, that's enough to say that I'm not addicted.

>Addiction isn't caused just by drugs. It's wiring in the brain formed through a reward feedback loop. Anything that produces pleasure can become addictive with enough misuse. It's just that some things, like drugs, cause addictions to form faster.

Sorry to say, but you have a very naïve and pop-culture view of drugs and addiction.  Psychological addiction is a thing and can be to anything enjoyable.  Physical dependence is a thing and is a property of several (but certainly not all) recreational drugs.  Psychological addiction is generally classed as such when - and only when - it begins to be a detriment to the wellbeing of the individual or those in the individual's surroundings.

To be clear: I have formally studied the appropriate neuroscience involved in physical dependence and am well aware of the ""reward feedback loop"" you're talking about.  There are very few drugs that hijack or interfere with this system directly (notable ones that do are specific stimulants like amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine).  Even most other highly addictive drugs are actually primarily addictive in that the withdrawals are very unpleasant, which is an effect of physical dependence rather than having anything to do with this reward system.

>Yes, addiction isn't the only factor into why someone wants a drug...but it's a massive part of demand.

This is simply wrong and unless you can provide evidence to back it up, I don't see how you can claim it.

>People don't typically buy alcohol because it's a good antiseptic. They buy it because when they consume it, it makes them feel good for a short time, at the expensive of their long term happiness.

True, people drink alcohol because they enjoy it.  However that is not *addiction* for the majority (although I freely admit that alcohol is a highly addictive and highly dangerous drug; even compared to most of the ""hard drugs"" that you're taught to be scared of).  Also, responsible moderate alcohol use is not ""at the expense of their long term happiness"".  You're more likely to have increased long term happiness if you are well socialised, which in most societies means moderate consumption of alcohol (I'd prefer it if other psychoactives were more accepted, but I don't mind the occasional drink; I do avoid drinking too much though as I don't enjoy it).

>If all drugs were legalized tomorrow, I'd bet we'd see a lot more demand for the more addictive drugs than for, say, pot, even though pot may have some other beneficial uses.

In the short term, probably, but not in the long term.  Interesting statistic: Germany has a higher per-capita use of cannabis than the Netherlands.  In Germany it's strictly illegal and the laws are enforced.  In the Netherlands it's ""tolerated"" and sold over-the-counter to anyone over the age of 18.

Personally I don't use cannabis, for similar reasons to avoiding too much alcohol - I don't like being ""out of control"".  The drugs I do like are those where I am able to remain rational, even if I'm experiencing artificially altered emotions or perceptions.

The ""beneficial use"" argument is one that always annoys me.  Yes, if something has beneficial uses, it should be used for that (MDMA is great in combination with therapy for PTSD for example).  However, this should have no bearing on whether or not it is legal or illegal for personal recreational use.  The only thing that is relevant there is the question of unintended and uncontrollable harm.  We don't make skydiving illegal just because it's potentially dangerous and doesn't have ""beneficial use"" (and if you claim that the recreation aspect of it is beneficial, then I'll make the exact same claim for recreational drugs).

Everything in life has risks, but do those risks (when clearly and objectively analysed) both outweigh the positives of recreational use (including basic cognitive liberty) as well as the negative effects of keeping it illegal (e.g. dangers of black market impure drugs; black market secondary crime including murder and slavery; lack of education about responsible use; etc)?  If the answer is yes, then it should be illegal.  If the answer is no - which I truly believe it is for pretty much any substance you can name - the only responsible path is clear and careful legalisation.";1;0;False;dalebewan;ec4buqf;Once you understand how bitcoin works, you also understand how futile banning it is..

">To disregard regulatory risks is foolish.

This is an important factor to take into account. There will always be all sorts of workaround to buy and sell cryptos, especially Bitcoin, as we have seen over the past few years. In most countries at present, there are various obstacles and limitations that make the exchange of cryptos difficult. For many users, it has become like a game of cat-and-mouse.

Despite the bans and obstacles, no country has actually been draconian yet in their response. Not even China, despite their much-quoted ""ban on Bitcoin"" last year. It will be different should governments view cryptos as becoming a serious threat. Then we will see the screw turned progressively as governments try to contain this threat (real or perceived). 

One rather easy way for governments to put the squeeze on crypto adopters is through the banks. They will freeze the accounts of those suspected to be dealing with cryptos, and thereby creating a lot of problems for those affected. That will create fear among adopters and trading volume of fiat/crypto will see a sharp reduction.

One big reason for the sustained interest in cryptos is the ability to go from fiat to crypto and vice versa fairly easily. Even if one believes cryptos are the future, he needs fiat right here and now. Forget the cavalier talk of ""dying for liberty and freedom"" - for most people, if their access to the fiat system is threatened, they will yield to the people controlling it. Unfortunate, but that's how things are. 

So, back to the main point quoted - we'd want to be onside with the government when it comes to cryptos. Even if a government can't control Bitcoin, for example, it sure can make things very difficult for the crypto's proponents in that particular country.

That's right, but we've seen how it went with China. First they banned Crypto exchanges in China, these exchanges then moved to Korea, Japan and continued to operate in a very unregulated way. In came crypto regulations in Korea forcing identification and banning foreign transfers, effectively making S.Korea a crypto island with divergent prices. In the end it's probably safe to say that the vast majority of Chinese bitcoin trading simply disappeared over the course of this and last year. Not 100%, but perhaps 90%.

"How easy is it for a significant percentage of the population to GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES...?

How many percent of the wealth in China do you think is in bitcoin? And to those who do hold bitcoin, how are they using it to pay for various expenses? Maybe a few people might pay with it at the even fewer places that accept it...and then tweeting about ""increasing adoption of Bitcoin in China!"" after paying $10 worth. LOL! 

No, it's not about the Yuan being a 'shit store of value' as you erroneously claim. As with practically all other places, they had converted SOME of their fiat to Bitcoin as a commodity to speculate on. In the hope that its value will be significantly higher when they convert back to fiat...which they are and will be using to pay their way in life. And this 'shit store of value' - tell that to the Chinese who had bought Bitcoin around this time last year. I'm fully sure they'd rather have that 'shit store of value' back if they could turn back the clock LOL!

'India has always been a GOLD country' - you mean the people there transact in gold? It's obvious you aren't aware of the fact it's mostly a CASH economy. That is, a significant number even get paid directly in rupee paper notes. Sure, some people there do have Bitcoin. But again, like in China, how many percent of wealth is in this? I'm betting INSIGNIFICANT when compared to the value of rupee in circulation.

'2 billion unbanked' - you mean they will be totally unaffected if the bank accounts of others in their country are frozen? They don't live in isolation - when those accounts are frozen, there will be a lot less work and business for them when the account holders can't get access to their own cash.

""Those who need Bitcoin"" - and who are these beyond those in countries with raging inflation and capital control? For the rest of the world, things work fine enough with their country's fiat. What reason do they have to convert their wealth to Bitcoin and move to another country - just because their government makes it difficult to buy and sell Bitcoin? LOL! That's definitely not a reason for any reasonable person to take such drastic steps. Not even 'crypto bugs'.

Face the fact: Bitcoin can be useful in certain situations. Personally I also hedge some of my money in it for prudence's sake and ""just in case"". But I wouldn't bet against the fiat in any country that is in reasonably good political and economic situation. For it has the power of government behind it.

"You are making one big mistake in your reasoning.

We are now living in a world that fully relies on technology.

Bitcoin is a technology that can and will enhance various processes in society.

If one country decides to ban bitcoin (as in, shuts down all exchanges and fiat tarnsactions, ban establishments from accepting bitcoin, rendering it virtually useless within their country),

they are automatically putting their country in a **major technological disadvantage**. Rendering themselves useless on a global scale. It's like banning internet and throwing themselves back 2 decades to the past.

Some naive 3rd world country with an incompetent government might try this. But their experiment won't last for long.

Game theory makes it virtually impossible for a country to ""ban bitcoin"" per your definition.

Just like it is impossible but ""possible"" to ban the internet, 

it is similarly impossible but ""possible"" to ban bitcoin.

The ""governments can ban it"" is an argument that was original made up by people who thought that Bitcoin is a product, comparable to how a random R-rated videogame is a (bannable) product.

But Bitcoin isn't a product. It's a technology.
