You just need a log of transactions. I actually kept it on coinbase most of the year as I was a dumb noob. I'm glad I didn't lose completely all of it to a mtgox duplicate. But yeah, coinbase has a log of transactions which you can give to the GOV to prove you sold and bought etc.;1;0;False;banditcleaner2;emuewje;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
Oh awesome. Good to know. This basically means that for any reasonable individual (middle class, maybe upper middle class) can invest and get back most of it in taxes but only slowly.

Nope, for BTC you have to sell or transact it.  For (a rough) example, If you buy BTC currently at $6000 and then hold through next year and it's then $10K, you don't pay any taxes on it until you sell. Appreciative assets do not require tax payments until being sold (OR transacted. Which means if you were to trade that BTC Into litecoin or some altcoin or something, then you would have to pay taxes on it.);2;1;False;banditcleaner2;emtkvth;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21

You belong to that latter group. You'll deny it, but I know you know I'm right.

"Ok idiots. Please do not go dropping your lives savings or rent money into bitcoin thinking it will go to “100,000!” like some have said. It will never reach 20,000 again, ever, and it has just bounced to 5,900 (6k) like I and many others have predicted it would bounce after the (also predicted) collapse. I mainly trade Forex and commodities but I have analyzed bitcoin after seeing so much wishful thinking while it was going up and then despair as it collapsed in these subs, and the sob stories that followed. Fundamentally it can never become a “new currency”, the technology can become adopted, but never bitcoin actual. In fact banks have started to buy into the tech, so I would say bitcoin will collapse back down to its marginal usage price level (the price that can be sustained due to usage) and leave its speculative inflated price behind forever. I’m not sure exactly what price the demand price would be, I’d say about 6-8k again. But never 20,000. Specially since more regulations and limitations will begin to be pushed by governments on bitcoin and other crypto usage, not less. Burn this into your memory even if it makes you angry and you’ll thank me later.

If Bitcoin does not prevail, it's not because of any inherent weakness in the model or the tech. Rather, it will be because the State will not allow it to. Why? Because the State will not tolerate - at least in it's present form - any mode of the circulation of value that it cannot control or dominate and Bitcoin and the related tech is something that the State cannot control thus the antagonism of the State vis a vis Bitcoin (and cryptos in general). But this does not mean that as a speculative asset the value of Bitcoin will not rise. Already one can see a cyclical pattern to how Bitcoin moves, which suggests that it will or is very likely to transcend it's previous ATH at some point in the near future.;1;0;False;robothistorian;emsauoq;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21

"I respond well to facts and good rationale, not your shitty (seriously, emphasis on shitty, be less patronizing) salesman tactics.

The whole ""research it yourself!"" is simply another way of saying ""this is bullshit"". Nobody who has a justifiable reason to be as confident as you are lacks the material to support it. Nobody who actually lacks the time to make their case spends so much time writing shallow Reddit posts defending their case without using the aforementioned material.

As for Google that just highlights your ignorance more than anything else you've said here so far, and that's saying something. Don't use it on the next person you talk to, they might know more about general investing than I do and *know* how to tear that argument down proper.
