"A lot of those things are patently illegal now and not because of unions while all of those things changed because the economics of our marketplace changed.

We were where China is now. People work those jobs to try and get ahead. Once they have in-demand skills and education (courtesy of their industrious parents working those jobs), they suddenly get pickier and also stop sending their kids to work.

The economic evolution of a country is a difficult but natural thing. Would you rather those kids starve, work hard labor on farms, or their parents work as prostitutes? That's what happens when these jobs don't exist, and those jobs have no reason to go to impoverished people and areas if they can't operate cheaply.

Doesn't mean they should do anything actually harmful (like pour toxic chemicals in rivers), but we also shouldn't force all of our standards arbitrarily on economies that aren't ready for it.";0;0;False;erdtirdmans;e5l8h4x;When Bitcoin price dips but you're a HODLer;9ds6dr;https://v.redd.it/i3xjpl96yrk11

"There is a giant risk this time around if the price gets too low. The 51% attack. There is so much hash power out there. Mining outfits are going to go out of business left and right if we crash. If that happens all that mining equipment is going to get used for something and it's going to become pretty inexpensive to attack various coins and even Bitcoin if the price goes low enough

That's the big difference between today and 2014. Back then there wasn't so much hash power

The other thing you should be wondering is if the price were to crash. Why exactly would that happen? There's no Mount gox this year. A crash would mean the people have just quit caring and threw in the towel. Maybe after a whole bunch of bullshit some people repair Bitcoin and try to relaunch it but it's going to be uphill struggle after all of the things that happened during that time. 

Personally I don't think anything like that is going to happen. I think the project tokens need to be eliminated from the market. I think they have been a major source of Fiat outflow. I think more new people will come to bitcoin if we can make it useful in Daily Society and potentially even if it just becomes a recognized store of value that the first world governments finally acknowledge

There are an increasing number of coding boot camps hitting the scene. Additionally, tech giants (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon) are no longer requiring CS degrees or ANY degree as long as you can get the job done. In your case, since you are transitioning professions your experience as a translator won’t carry over at all. I’m not sure which direction you are looking to take but my recommendation to you would be to BUILD something. I’ve come across a lot of people in your situation and the coding is a great first start. I would continue to learn more, but what will really make you pop is to build an app and publish it to the store. You can do this and learn at the same time and you’ll have something to show for it that will set you apart from the rest. If you are having a hard tome finding a job to start off, work with a recruiting agency (Aerotech, Robert Half, Teksystems, etc). They cost you NOTHING and will get the ball rolling for you.

In terms of getting your profile noticed...hiring managers can’t sift out the fluff pretty quick when reviewing profiles, they are mainly looking at experience. Your accomplishments and specific involvement in projects should be very well articulated and easy to understand. Once in a great while some candidates may slip through and get a phone screen, but very rarely will they get farther unless they have the core skills required for the position.

I have resume reviews with hiring managers multiple times a week, so I get to hear them think out loud while reviewing resumes often. I would say if you use wrote “unemployed” without explaining the gap of employment it will most likely raise a red flag. Having the qualifications is clearly what’s most important, but if you have a break in service without an explanation concerns may arise surrounding ambition or work ethic. Even if you simply just wrote “taking the opportunity to travel the world” or anything along those lines it’s completely understandable. Big plus if you have a personal tech related project that you worked on during your gap. ;2;0;False;MaydayMalone65;e5mm60o;Altcoin Master;9dyk1w;https://i.redd.it/febayr7qsvk11.jpg
