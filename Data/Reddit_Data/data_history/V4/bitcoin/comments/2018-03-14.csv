How is it struggling? People are doing great here. I’ve traveled all over the country, my biggest complaints are how dogs are treated (absolutely disgusting), unclean water, and rarely some foodsafe issues. Otherwise it’s a paradise. I’ve also traveled extensively through about 22 countries, and this place is particularly hard on dogs. I’ve never been to China or Russia tho.

I walk down the street in my gf’s neighbourhood, and these ugly ass looking pit bulls scare the ever loving fuck out of us literally slamming their faces into the fence and barking at you really loud. They damage the big metal gates. They were probably really nice dogs at one point, but being locked in tiny cages (a carport) their whole life drives them loco. Drives me nuts too. There are no nice dog parks to take them to, and if they were ever let off leash, they would go kill other little chihuahuas;1;0;False;ranplett;dvo5ivm;The latecomer’s BTC journey;83qeea;https://v.redd.it/hqzbut8or7l01

"I may not agree with this. Imagine how costly is doing the same job locally, it is much more efficient if an algorithm optimizes search results in advance, so then I just spent several seconds doing that. 

First on the physical level, just sum up the electricity consumption (of LCD etc), amortization of machines etc. The search algorithm doesn't need LCD whatsoever. 

More importantly, imagine how many brain-hours are saved in this way.. just a small improvement in their algorithm is saving several tens of lifes a day! That is where the real wealth is created.
