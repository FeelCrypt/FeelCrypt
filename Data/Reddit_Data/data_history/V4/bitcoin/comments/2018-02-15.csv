"The assumption that *anything* is specifically required for one's happiness is shortsighted. It's hard to separate personal feelings and experience from discussions, but always remember that people differ *wildly*.

Happiness, at the end of the day, isn't exactly real. It's all just chemicals. What makes me happy may not be the same thing that makes you happy.

By your logic, I could say something like ""You can't truly be happy without a watch."" or ""you can't truly be happy without family.""

These are both demonstrably untrue, and a little insensitive toward those who lost families. It gives us warm fuzzies to hold the notion of love above all else, but at the end of the day it's just science.

Go to my last post from three days ago. You'll see that I came up with very easy ways to bypass the things that you called ""not-anonymous"".

I misread one of your arguments in that case (I thought you said ""e-mail"" but you said ""the mail"") but I can still provide a way to bypass that. If you rent a hotel/motel/apartment room then you can use the address of said place. What stops you from doing that? Also does every single bitcoin exchange (I assume this is where you register?) require you to use the mail? What about those in foreign countries (I stay in a third world country and our mailing system is nonexistent but I know people with bitcoins)? With computers you can use a VPN to scramble your location/identity (or you can even use a public cafe). So yeah, I might be pretty ignorant right now (assuming these things have answers) but that's because instead of arguing and listing points to convince me, you've been ranting at me for not swallowing every single thing you say (you, a random person on the internet) and for not regarding everything I've seen elsewhere online as trash (with you being the sole source of truth).

>You have to mail cash. I'm sure you don't understand how this could be a problem. But anyone else reading this should immediately understand why this is a problem.

Answered above.

>Just making and using the accounts to try to make it look legal is a logistic nightmare.

1) Why is this so?

2) What stops a rich person with numerous resources from having the means to do this?

3) **""Nightmare"" does not mean impossible.**

>You can't just have money appear from a crypto currency and that makes it legal. The IRS and FBI will still want to know where you got it from.

This isn't my main argument against this, but I just thought of it now. You can use the art and charities you mentioned earlier to claim/clean the money.

But my main points against this are that (1) As bitcoin becomes more acceptable, a person might be able to spend this money directly as bitcoins more easily and (2) Assuming you pay with bitcoins through a proxy you can spend the money while removing yourself from the equation.

So that's three points in total. Please answer to them.

"Replying late because I have exams and haven't been on reddit for a while.

You pretty much said the opposite of this earlier when you were like:  ""*You don't even know how to LEGALLY launder money*.""

But I digress. That doesn't have much to do with my main point.

Me or you not having the necessary knowledge to regard ourselves as money launderers can be put aside. We're on the internet so we can see how money laundering can or can not be done with the aid of cryptocurrency. To reiterate, my point is that bitcoin, through its potential powers of anonymity can provide a way for money launderers to more easily store funds without passing through any financial institution that can record the passage of said funds. Money laundering being restricted to rich people or not is not important to the argument. My point is that it can be performed.

>That is the purpose, to legally claim the money. And no, there's no legal way to do it. But there's a way that is commonly accepted. For example buying and selling art. And charitable foundations.

We do have a spending problem in America, where people are encouraged to spend rather than save. Surely You must concede on that point.

"> Couldn't you also say ""Why would I spend a dollar today when I can put it in the stock market and buy effectively more stuff next year?""

Isn't putting it into the stock market actually *spending it*? Like, suppose you buy stocks in, say, an apple company. That money goes to either 

1. the apple company as investment, or 
2. someone taking their money out. 

For #1, the apple company uses that money to expand their business by buying apple-picking machines. That is, they spend your money, which goes through the economy.

For #2, someone else now has more money to spend. All else being equal, them having more money means them *spending* more money, on average. Or maybe they just buy stocks, which again has a chance of #1 happening. In fact, I'm pretty sure if this happens *without* a chance of #1 happening, it's a ponzi scheme.

"> The app could very well have been talking to his own backend, a backend which could be using the exchange APIs

What would be the benefits of that?  
We talked about the downside, but I don't see any benefits of this.  
Except that you can in some way fitler out the data - so the app receives from your hosted back-end different/modified data than the one the exchange gives. Let's say  you remove a few things because they are not needed, or maybe you add a few more that you've calculated.  
But the trade off to do that on some back-end serve rinstead of just in the front-end is not worth it.";1;1;False;RG_PankO;dua0e8t;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

"So let me get this straight. You are not 16, developed a desktop app (which is €13 on the store), wrote medium articles, got a good website to present this, have a ready press kit, had done interviews and mentions and you are present on social media.

"Unlikely to purchase as I'm not really interested in the product (thanks for sharing though!), but did want to offer a comment on licensing that largely echo's the other feedback you've had.  Relevant, only because I do purchase software, use multiple computers and I do pay attention to how the vendor both licenses and enforces licenses.  Please consider that much of your userbase is most likely users of multiple computers, might be willing to have it actively running on only one computer at a time, but want it installed on whatever machine they are using.  Limiting total activations may sound viable, but without a self service mechanism, you will quickly find users complaining about having to wait on you to fix something they feel they bought (that one on it's own in combination with free or cheaper alternatives that were 'good enough' prevented a purchase from me).

The best license mechanisms I've used have been ones that are just legal terms and it's up to me to enforce.  But since you feel that isn't option, it's your baby, totally understand, the next best have been ones I have to activate online with no limit to activations, but a vendor that pays attention to abnormally high activation counts and contacts me for verification.  Licenses that allow me to install on X machines, use on a single one at any given time and provide a mechanism to deactivate unused machines (Steam!).  In both cases, I would say that the licensing mechanism is pretty unobtrusive and enforces the developers rights.  Up to a point...the licensing mechanism is going to be reverse engineered and cracked eventually anyway.  Protecting your code provides value to you by theoretically creating more sales, but costs you development time that could be used to make the product better, which on it's own may create more sales.";2;2;False;doxavg;du9fzci;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.
