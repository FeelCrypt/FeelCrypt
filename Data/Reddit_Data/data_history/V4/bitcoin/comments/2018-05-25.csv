"The fact that the extra prizes hidden amongst this is confusing, there’s certain wallet seeds in here that will lead up in the write direction but also give the OP the heads up someone is close. 

I think that to infinity and beyond leads to the X cuts the “map” in half, with the => which lines up with the cuts leads to answer in this half.

The +1 and -1 is talking about blocks when someone is attacking them, this is the original hint given In the INSTRUCTIONS that the puzzle lead back to the underlying security features.

This also leads me other facts another hint which I’m keeping quite on..

But yet again it leads back to private and public key(‘s) which I have a strong feeling is in the seed (pairs but also oppersites).

I tried matching the dates and other numbers to their assigned bip32 words, but this I felt let me down.

Tried running brute force on the words I felt most inclined with (still running nothing so far, can pass on details in pm if y’all request it (Linux)) 

Clue four leads to what I was saying before about keys and also I think paper is a seed word in their for some reason.

Clue 7 I’m not to sure on.

Clue 3 I’m sure has to do with being written in C

Hmm idk throwing ideas up, like or don’t :) 

00212121 backwards gives the hexidecimal 0xb8f470

"I guess I have managed it. I played this game at school solving IQ questions. The way it works is to remove firstly all the ""SMALLEST"" words as they are for distructing. Since backup words are 12, you have to draw lines as:

Column: 4

Row: 3

Then get rid of all the words that are touching the lines and leave the ones that are in particular boxes. And here the games start. You have to collect the words 1 from each blocks and create 12 word combinations.

I havent tried but would be nice if any of you try it. And, please dont be greedy. When you break it, give some to me too :)

"My clues for you:

1. You are wasting your time on the +1, try +1 clues. That's common internet comment for agreeing or thumbs up. So the real clue is the message before. Like in the first time u/cryptogreetings said +1 the message it was reply to was ""That's a bitcoin address not a public key"" so that's the real clue. And when u/cryptogreetings said ""try +1"", it was reply to u/brblol's comment ""I give up"" meaning that they respect the effort or, the previous comment by u/brblol was about reference to movie. So he/she might have been on to something.

2. Clue: ""To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot."" To Infinity and Beyond is reference or just using the same known frase as in Toy Story. As u/pg3crypto pointed out. Or of course could mean that from x to ""infinity sign"" and beyond that, what makes me thing that why everyone is only focusing on the middle part.  -> This bonus clue was removed, because it's misleading or too revealing? I think at least partly miss leading.

3. The clue for getting rid of almost half of the words means of course that only half or such in the pic are not Bip39 words or only the small words counts.

4.  My guess for the now removed passphrase would have been Pac-Man. Since 257 is at the X, and 257 is the kill-screen in packman :)

And now u/cryptogreetings will give me ""1. +1"" and if I also got Pack-Man right/close I'll get also ""4. +1"".

I hope that saves lot of time from you not focusing on the falsely interpreted clues.

p.s. so if I get the Bip39 words and type it in to e.g. https://iancoleman.io/bip39 so which one of the key's I need to import e.g. to blockhain.info? There are so many options on the page when you scroll down, or is that part of the puzzle?

"I guess I have managed it. I played this game at school solving IQ questions. The way it works is to remove firstly all the ""SMALLEST"" words as they are for distructing. Since backup words are 12, you have to draw lines as:

Column: 4

Row: 3


Then get rid of all the words that are touching the lines and leave the ones that are in particular boxes. And here the games start. You have to collect the words 1 from each blocks and create 12 word combinations.
