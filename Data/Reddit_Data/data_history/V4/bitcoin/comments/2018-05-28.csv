"? ... and maybe that's why we have to also ""try 201"" or ""try +1""? To produce the value for the target in SHA256, and maybe the ""target"" is the ""x marking home"" on the missing glyph box within the puzzle font image unless it is suppose to be a Sigma and not the missing value? Maybe it is Sigma (the math symbol that looks like a funny looking ""E""), and we need the ACSII Hex for the letter/glyph that represents Sigma as the input ""int"" number for +1 and/or -1 depending on where and how such data is used; be it used for finding the starting 0's which is using -1 or be it using +1 for getting a target -- all this to maybe obtain a finger print verification which may use a string of words run through the SUM function of SHA256 rather than numbers as an input ... ?

These are just some ideas to try, but this process maybe the process used (from the video), but from what data inputs I'm still unsure about.";0;1;False;AmirisJBrown;dzpxiiz;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

"During March of 2013:
BTC had competing Berkley Database (BerkleyDB) vs. Google's Level Database (LevelDB) run time consensus algorithms. Of which the BerkleyDB version had a bug limiting the file descriptors.

Also during that same time frame, ""Bitcoin’s computing power distribution between 2 April 2013 and 1 July 2013. BTC Guild and 50BTC controlled more than 55 percent of network computing power, until ASICMiner achieved more than 20 percent of the hashing power"" (source:
https://www.infoq.com/articles/is-bitcoin-a-decentralized-currency ).

Thus, with the data presented within this puzzle I think the process we may have to take is this, (maybe that's the ""001"" in the puzzle is for and/or what the ""00212121"" clue is for in first running the SHA256 to get the finger print and/or a valid Block header of which may start and stop at specific places based upon the data presented in the puzzle so to validate the blocks between those two points and/or possibly just replicating or studying the Blockchain history of when the miners lost their Block Rewards for being on the wrong chain) as explained here in this video lecture:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fw3WkySh_Ho# (""Consensus Algorithms, Blockchain Technology and Bitcoin UCL - by Andreas M. Antonopoulos"" posted on aantonop's YouTube channel).

Also, if the missing input of an ""int"" number starts with two zeros then the, ""number has to be less than 'two' to the 254"" and maybe since the first zero used -1 this part of -1 for the math still applies for doubling to the next zero is my illiterate-to-math guess as in starting at, ""00"" (this is quoted from and explained around the 7 minutes and 45 seconds mark of Mr. Antonopoulos' video linked above).";0;1;False;AmirisJBrown;dzpw0iv;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"I'm a diamond ... lol jk

Anyway, em3s maybe staying cryptic due to being close but maybe not unlocking the wallet yet and thus don't want to volunteer a frog leap up for anyone who could figure out the steps if explained clearly and then surpass them in solving it?

::: shrugs :::

I don't blame em3s. That was my plan at first haha unless I teamed up, but now I'm posting anything and everything (eventually, I haven't sat down and uploaded all the pics I want to post here as reference), and so I have exited the two team up reply offers as of Saturday since I have my surgery funds to not die regardless of solving this puzzle or not (besides I doubt I would solve it by myself, I didn't even know 77 was a prime for example which proves I'm at a steep disadvantage here only knowing artistic design and BitCoin theoretical concepts, no grammar nor math to back-up either pursuit niche lol fml lol). Oh and I know too little of C++ to feel confident enough that I would be coding anything properly lol there's that too, as years ago when I did learn C++ even though I think I got a B grade in that course in college and a C or D grade back when I had it in high school, honestly I have always been but a mere incompetent script kiddie never an actual programmer (unless I can copy n paste chunks of code to mash up together in one big sloppy thing which works great in CSS haha, I'm not going to be building any solution using C++ anytime soon though lol).

With that said, when I get my oral surgery and on the road to recovery, I might try out of pure boredom at my hand in running some C++ for this puzzle -- assuming I'll be in less pain so to focus and think clearly and assuming this puzzle won't be solved by then still.";1;0;False;AmirisJBrown;dzq9mz0;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"My brain is fried so hopefully this information is useful to someone. 

* You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture.
* Think in pairs  
* Code easily, attack early  
* Lost transaction costs almost users  
* 00212121  
* Try \+1  
* Almost open  
* Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)  
* \-1

I put another users image in photoshop \(whoever filtered by BIP39 words\) and ended up cropping the image down using the clues. 

* For the top portion, I cropped to just above the **infinity symbol** \(infinity and beyond\).
* For the left portion, I cropped to the left of **code**
* For the right portion, I cropped to the right of **open**.
* For the bottom, I cropped to the word **easily**

Since **code** and **easily** were separated, I figured it was mentioned to crop by. I am then assuming **attack** and **early** is a valid pair and also allows **\-\-\- words** and **/** words.

I included the word **costs** because its right before **open** \(almost open\).

I counted, and there are 12 level words, and 12 angled words. I wrote them down in excel top to bottom, left to right and got the following for each one.

**Level words**

stay   find   ability   post   sign   attack   fee   entire   costs   now   problem   proof    

**Slanted words \(like early\)**

cash   rely   pool   use   main   early   else   split   race   gap   order   define    

When put side by side in the order they appear, top to bottom, left to right, here is how they match up. Notice how **attack** and **early** are paired together.

|stay|cash|
|:-|:-|
|find|rely|
|ability|pool|
|post|use|
