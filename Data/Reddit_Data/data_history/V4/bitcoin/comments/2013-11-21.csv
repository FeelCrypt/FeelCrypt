"The former is readily apparent, the latter is an animalistic reaction... pure and simple ""feelings dictating a response to stimulus.""

Every post I've made have asked Questions, which is part of the ability to Learn New things or engage in a conversation. I have also made Assertions, statements of understanding given currently possessed information. The Questions are asked in order to make adjustments to the Assertions.

Every post *you* have made have been name-calling, derision, and... what's the word?... oh, yeah... closed-minded.

I have given examples of my thinking, whereas you have merely stuck your tounge and stomped your feet.

If you aren't going to engage in an actual discussion on the topic, why continue participating? Are ya angry, did your feel-goods get hurt, or is it just that you really don't understand the nature of a conversation and debate?

Either give an **EXAMPLE** to support your position so that we can actually have a discussion, or admit that you're position is based in fear and insecurity and so doesn't warrant further investigation.

It's certainly a quandary, but I'd still make the argument that bitcoin has such marginal use as a currency that it should not be taxed as such.  It is more often referred to as a commodity than a currency.  ;1;0;False;3domfighter;cdjyfqj;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

""Backed by"" used to mean that portable land (gold, silver, ...) was represented by the piece of paper, thus the piece of paper was ""backed by"" something of actual substance.

However, what was the portable land backed by? Um... It looked pretty?

Effectively, in the end, all currencies are fiat (arbitrary mediums of exchange) and backed by faith (I trust it because you trust it ).

That may be so, but how can they classify bitcoin as a collectible?  People don't buy it to collect, they use it in commerce or save/invest in it.  I'd argue, along with everyone who ever existed outside of the IRS, that taxing gold and silver bullion at collectible rates is flat out BULLSHIT and designed to steer investors away from it.

I think that would depend how long you held it.  Personally I treat it essentially as a stock or ETF.  I don't report gains until they are realized, and when I do I classify them as long- or short- term based on the actual time frame for which I held the asset.  I think that's what you were saying. So yeah, I would treat it like a stock, but you won't get the neat and clean statement from your brokerage--you'll have to do it yourself.  ;1;1;False;3domfighter;cdjxkod;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"Important point missed in the 2nd day of the hearing.
Senator asked what kind of encryption was used for the general ledger and if it was trapdoor prime number encryption.

That was sort of a nonsense question, they should have responded:  ""THERE IS NO ENCRYPTION IN THE BITCOIN PROTOCOL.""

Importantly, the general ledger is not encrypted at all, it is public, and readable (requiring no subpoena) and it is also hashed (it has forensically verifiable integrity).

"While I'm impressed that you took the time to do this, I have to say that I don't particularly want the government involved, not for my ideals, but because of the enormous economic experiment going on here.

Think about it: this is the first currency that's entirely unregulated.  If anything, it could help us get a better understanding of basic economic principles, and it's for this reason that I've been participating in bitcoin.  I love the idea, and I want to see what happens.

If it wins, which I think it will, then hooray.  If it loses, then se la vi.

">I don't trade currency so I'm out of my depth there--are currency gains taxed differently from other asset classes if they've been held long-term?

[Yep.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1256_Contract)

With currency trading it doesn't matter how long you hold them, as gains and loses will be both taxes as short and long term gains.

The thing is, crypto isn't really an equity, and hasn't really been established as a currency, so it's hard to know what the government wants it taxed as unless they tell us.

Personally, last year I just figured out what taxes will be as an equity, and a currency, and just paid what was higher to be safe.
