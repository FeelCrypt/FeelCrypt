"As someone who's a 'Bitcoiner' and has been for a very long time, that post you replied to is filled with bullshit.

The answer to your question without all the misleading statements and lies is simply that as a consumer in the US in the vast majority of cases you would not benefit by using bitcoin. Especially if you as a consumer are comparing it to using a credit card(protection, cash back ect). It's not even close and it never has been. Anyone who ever thought or ever tried to pass off Bitcoin as a competitor in that area is misguided at best, and a conman at worst.

Perhaps in the future layers will be built on top of Bitcoin that enable consumers to use it in a way that makes it something to consider for the average consumer. But today is not that day, and it's not even close really. For someone who already has BTC and wants to buy something online or whatever like a game on Steam or something, it's a reasonable option sometimes. Still probably worse than someone who responsibly uses a credit card that takes advantages of rewards and such, but whatever we're not talking about a lot of money here and if you're using bitcoin on a regular basis on the web for a variety of reasons it's decent enough to use. I might use it that way, but I certainly don't think that this case is applicible to the average person. Nor should it be right now the way it is really. They'd probably end up losing their bitcoin through malware, phishing, hacking ect. That's just the way it is. Just like people get their credit card information stolen fairly often. Big difference here is that once your bitcoin is gone it's really gone. Whereas if something happens to your credit card and you wake up to $5000 worth of charges it takes one phone call and one signature to make those charges disappear and have a fresh new card shipped to you right away. 

For now Bitcoin is a unique, very secure system when used correctly that people are working on integrating into the global financial system. It has its uses as another tool in the financial tool box, like many other different financial products. For example it's a lot more interesting to people in China who have money but also happen to live under the thumb of an authoritarian 'communist' government than it is to your average person in the US. And unsurprisingly the volume of Bitcoin trading that goes on in China is multiple times higher than the US. Just ignore the charlatans trying to sell you something here. It's interesting, and imo pretty cool technology that adds a new degree of freedom in the global financial system, and it's always nice to have options and choice. One of the issues is that it tends to attract a lot of crazy people will get rich quick dreams who try to package it up as some bullshit that its not, sugarcoat it, and sell it to people like yourself. It's annoying, but I guess somethings never change and this situation comes up again and again every little while.";9;0;False;BeastmodeBisky;dh8jldt;Amazing bitcoin billboard near LAX!;69mugf;https://i.redd.it/f4dmhdwzexvy.jpg
"The idea of bitcoin is that the amount produced every 4 years is halved and as time progresses, transaction fees will increase and become the incentive for the miners to continue operating.  

Bitcoin is backed by a cryptographic code, complex maths questions need solving, all the miners work to solve it, whoever gets there first, gets the reward of bitcoin.  Your explanation of how useless fiat currency is, and that bitcoin is no different is spot on, at the end of the day they are both totally redundant, how you want to store your wealth while the option is there, is what this is about. I think most bitcoin advocates would say gold is still smarter/safer than bitcoin.  

Bitcoin fees are smaller than with banks for sure, but they are increasing with more users using bitcoin. Coinbase (popular bitcoin exchange) lets you buy/sell bitcoin with 1.5% fees, and buy with creditcard for 4% in most places. Most crypto exchanges have much smaller fees like 0.25%  

Cashing out doesn't have a fee of nearly 10% at all.. and the transaction fee is roughly the same size depending on sending $1 or $1000   

You have to trust the exchange when you had over your fiat currency, the same as you do with ebay, amazon etc. Once you have the bitcoin, you don't have to have faith in any recipient.  

Yes, if you don't protect your bitcoins you can lose them, same as if you left your bank password saved on mozilla? there are cold wallet storages devices with no connectivity to the internet for safe keeping of bitcoin.  

A quick google of north korea and bitcoin shows lots of news results, hackers over there stealing it and what not.. so yea I'd say, bitcoin is fairly invasive.  

The fees you pay to the miner who processes your transaction, his computer does the work to get your transaction logged onto the network, more miners come along after and further confirm it, getting a smaller chunk of the fee.  

Credit cards that use bitcoin are freely available, so you wouldn't have an issue there if you didn't want one. The point you're making here, is that it isn't fully adopted yet, which is very true, imagine how much it would cost if it was.  

Why would you want a currency with limited supply like gold, rather than a fiat currency where the banks just freely print more and your hardwork becomes less valuable? Who knows..

"The Blockchain has been proven very stable and anti-fragile, the more is attacked the stronger it gets. Governments can try to put barriers, but can't ban mathematics, can't kill decentralized systems, only can affect individual companies, but never bitcoin/blockchain itself. And it has been proven also very safe: Centralized companies/entities (Silk Road, MtGox, NeoBee, Butterfly, MyCoin, PayCoin/PayBase, etc) fail due to their own corruption and/or incompetence, and can be a scam or a ‘ponzi’, like in any other area. The Blockchain (the system/protocol/platform) remains untouched because it is decentralized and 'antifragile', evolving and becoming ever stronger.


We are far away from MtGox times. We have now secure software and hardware wallets very easy to use. Also,  exchanges like Gemini.com or Coinbase.com are fully licensed and regulated by the US Government and Agencies, they comply with all KYC/AML laws and regulations.

Coinbase Vault is very safe for storage, they store >99% of bitcoins offline in cold storage, so they can't be hacked/stolen. If you are not tech savvy (like >99% of world population) it's much more probable that you end up losing them (for many reasons) if you store them yourself. Even if the internet goes down, it will be only temporarily, and anyway bitcoin can be stored offline on paper or hardware wallets and transferred via radiofrequency/radiowaves, a peer-to-peer decentralized system is not going to disappear, the future systems will be decentralized and digital.

"Many have experienced oppression from their government's and banking sectors in the World. They freeze all your bank accounts and make you prove sources of funds completely disrupting your life for no good reason, they freeze your merchant accounts and destroy your business, the banks are insecure and get hacked often and people lose trust in that security, the economies fail and banks steal money from the bank accounts of people in the country, they won't let you send money to certain countries, they won't let you send certain amounts out the country or receive certain amounts into the country. Governments are introducing more oppressive taxing systems like double tax for some things which is just stealing from the population, governments are confiscating assets like gold in some countries if you have more than 100g, Governments are devaluing their currency and making life savings worthless overnight then turning off the ATMs so you have no money at all, they are eliminating the largest denominations of cash in some countries causing people to lose their savings and livelihoods if they don't have a bank account. Governments are making it legal to instantly hack phones and personal computers without needing a warrant making your bank information even more insecure, they are trying to force backdoors into various software to remove encryption making your credit card details even more available to international hackers. They are planning to make a completely cashless society in some Countries which would mean all the money you earn and save would be digital and can literally be turned off at the push of a button and you could do *nothing* about it.

Bitcoin solves all of these issues for billions around the World, maybe you have not personally faced any of these first hand. But if you  type each one into google you'll find out how many billions around the world suffer from the aforementioned issues - and it is getting worse. Probably the only one you've even heard of  as an example is Paypal freezing business accounts and causing entire businesses to shut down for no reason. It happens daily.

Now, as I said maybe this doesn't affect you yet. So why would you be interested in Bitcoin? Well, it is a new tech that solves a lot of problems for a lot of people and it is in its infancy. You might not have a particular use case for it right now, but others clearly do, so for you it is just a once in a life time investment. 

If Bitcoin achieves even 1% of what people expect it to, it will be worth 10,000USD within 10 years and some professional analysts have said each coin could easily be worth 500,000USD in 20 years.

Now consider, many bought in at 10USD 50USD 200USD 500USD and still see its adoption increasing and its use cases expanding as governments around the world become more oppressive.

BUT there is no guarantee!!! that the price of bitcoin is rising. And Bitcoin does not need new people to survive - that is false. It does not matter if bitcoin is 1 cent or 1000000 million Dollar.


Bitcoin needs miners who are ""responsible"" for the blockchain and those are generating new coins through a complex mathematical algorithm. The concept behind it amazes me to be honest. You could compare this to gold mining/miners.


But the price is also rising because of supply and demand. The more people get in and hold (don't sell the coins for some years) the less bitcoin are on exchanges - there are max. 21 million bitcoins available. That is just simple economics.


But you are right that you don't invest in something you don't understand. It is still a high risk to invest in Bitcoin. But look up Onecoin - countries ban it because it is a Ponzi - but they did not ban Bitcoin because there is no MLM scheme.

Plus, if the government of your currency happens to be very powerful, such as USD it pretty much forces people to use it.

I don't really think bitcoin is very appealing for the average person right now. It's still the early days of the technology. It has a while to go before it is easier to use. I personally think there is a lot of room for the price to go up. The higher the price the more useful Bitcoin becomes and the less volatility it has. I use it to make online purchase for band merch from hello merch. It's not that I really think it's better or easier then PayPal but I prefer Bitcoin over having to get out my debit card. It's still a developing technology and it has many potential use cases. If you are really curious about it just buy like ten buck so mess around with. ;1;0;False;project_trollbox;dh8b4p4;Amazing bitcoin billboard near LAX!;69mugf;https://i.redd.it/f4dmhdwzexvy.jpg
"> Trading gold futures is sending people gold in the same way bitcoin is sending someone money. 

The POINT I was making bringing up gold is a) bitcoin is a store of value UNLIKE FIAT and LIKE gold. b) gold is bad to buy things with because it's not easily divisible BUT bitcoin is. c) therefore bitcoin is electronic gold.

All I'm saying is that like a foreign currency, Bitcoin is also a Currency. The governing body for it, however, is not a nation, it's a protocol with a majority of the participants agreeing on the rules of exchange. Which, honestly, is how nations largely work in the general sense. And like any other Currency its value is mediated by supply and demand.


Wikipedia's articles on Currency and Digital Currency support this specific definition, as well as your more general definition. In fact the rest of the article on Currency deals with Fiat Currencies only and non-Fiat Currencies are relegated to other articles.


You and I both also agree that Apples are not a Currency. They're a commodity, they have a value and can be traded. But one apple may not have the same value as another.

The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.


**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**

* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (a few cents fee).


* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)

* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)

* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)

* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿

We know crypto can do so many things, but people still won't adopt. Why? Maybe it's just too early yet? I mean if BTC magically replaced fiat overnight people would learn how to use it and how to protect their stash and exchanges would be obsolete. That's what I'd like to see. Total user autonomy.
