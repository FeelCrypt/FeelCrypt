Man the day I decide to manage firends or family funds for them for crypto...ef that. People around me think it's play money and isn't real and shit talk it even though they prove my aguments about why BTC is so beneficial. Ain't no way I'm helping them out and dealing with the roller coaster with them on the seat next to me bitching about how they want to get off. I can't wait to throw it in everyone's face later. Does that make me a bad person? Even after I explain the benefits to people they still hair chose to say it shit or fake.

"> Well, the point of my comment was not related to reputation, but rather that you can't assume someone is new to the subreddit because their name is new.

Maybe not directly related but indirectly? Absolutely. My point is that since this is a forum built on reputation, you really have no choice if you want information from a credible source. Especially in this sub where r/BTC trolls seem to be common.

> But also, reputation means fuckall.

A simple search will tell you everything you need to know about this persons reputation specific to whatever sub you're on. You just did it to me.

> If your argument is so weak as not to stand on it's own without the support of an established username, you probably don't have a very good argument.

Since when did citing credible sources to substantiate claims start weakening arguments?

At the end of the day all roads lead back to the reputation of the person making the post. Me making this post alone will only go so far.

Hey, good for you. Here is what I would recommend that may help you. If you were broke before, continue living like you are still broke. BTC is going to fluctuate wildly. Don't watch it obsessively. I won't say forget you have it, just don't make it your focus, kind of like that cousin you have that you don't really like but you have to check in on every now and then because they are family after all. If things are going well in a year or so, maybe take your cousin our for a bit of celebrating, if it looks like things are not so good, continue to ignore him for a while. By then, you should have your regular savings built back up.

"A big reason for that is because of how abstracted they are from the way money actually works in their daily lives. Printed money or minted coins with ASSIGNED value. There is no actual goods backing the value like there used to be (gold). Third parties controlling their money. Credit cards make them feel safe because a third party provides certain protections up to certain values if anything goes wrong. This is what they are used to and what makes sense to them because it's the way it has been for a long time. Change is scary and they don't actually see what's wrong with current systems.

The current monetary system is almost a virtual currency at this point because money is moved with numbers from database to database. Someone in banking could just create money out of thin air. The only reason it doesn't happen is because banking is a business and it would be fraud. The books need to balance. We are trusting specific people and organizations to not completely devalue money and cheat the system.

Bitcoin is balanced by the system. It doesn't need to be audited and checked for fraud. No one can just say they have x more bitcoins than they have because all the books are completely public and backed by cryptography making transactions unalterable.

I think things will chain once cryptocurrency and the blockchain have enough abstraction layers to make it as easy as credit cards and a way to safely store their bitcoins like they do with money. I think people feel safer making someone else responsible for their money than themselves. Bitcoin right now isn't mainstream enough to have a form of ""bank chains"" where people can store their bitcoin and feel safe about it. It's not for everyone yet and there isn't a REASON for first-world nations to stop using their current trusted form of currency.

I'm going to stop here before I write a poorly-written endless essay, but I think I got my point across.

A friend actually explained this as a ""logical argument"". If he buys Bitcoin, the price should go up by a few pennies. Then, people will see the price rose, and as a result they'll want to invest more, thus raising the price. Eventually that will chain react into everyone buying it, and raise the price even more.

"That happens a lot in moments like this last month. Many of us finally decided to invest because we saw what happened in March. Even when we knew about Bitcoin since 2009/2010. For me it was the time. I couldn't before. I can now. But of course I wasn't expecting another March in June. Specially when you begin to know a bit more about this market. I just want to start investing and be there for the next moment when things start rising like crazy, because if I wait for the perfect time to start, I'll probably miss it anyway. I think many others started trading thinking this was like March all the time. People getting 20x their initial investment in days without a single dip. And many of them are dropping the ball now thinking this is all a scam or that crypto was a way to make lots of money a couple of years ago but not anymore. Blaming their luck for starting when the bubble was about to pop.

I'm not 100% sure, but I want to believe with patience, research and a little more every month, I'll look back 3-4 years from now and think this was a good idea.

"A Keynesian in our midst, eh? Begone, scourge of the Austrian school!

Seriously though, while I agree that policies like QE can have benefits, I would argue that the drawbacks of the system outweigh them. QE is unfair on the general population as the money does not seem to be ""filtering down"", and merely encourages banks to make greater risks with their money, for personal profit. It also allows for more currency manipulation. Another downside is that it creates a false stock market belief, and affects investment in company stocks and shares.

Your point about volatility affecting the everyday price of goods and services is valid, however the idea is that once there is enough market cap and liquidity in Bitcoin, this volatility should decrease. And not many people are expecting Bitcoin to be a replacement for fiat currency anyway, at least not for many years.

There are many other downsides to QE, such as constant inflation (which i don't believe is a good thing - I don't buy the ""hoarding"" theory, where people continue to hoard a deflating currency/asset, supposedly crashing the economy). I could go on, but in summary I believe the Keynesian system is flawed, and creates a kind of ""crony capitalism"" whereby banks, investors and rich people in general benefit, while the majority are worse off.

You are correct in saying that ""Bitcoin by design has no method of managing those swings.""

"Ah ok. I just felt like bitcoin's fluctuations are managed by the market/mining which are more natural and decentralized rather than giving the power to a third-party who can sharply affect the value themselves.

With bitcoin, as the supply decreases, the value will naturally increase per bitcoin, but we will just use fractions of a bitcoin. All the other factors will affect bitcoin the same way it affects money without the possibility of increased supply on demand by people in power.

I don't believe that bitcoin is a stable currency right now. Merchants who accept it are pricing them based on their local currency value and trading them on-the-fly to avoid getting caught on a downswing.

"Those aren't disputing my point: that fractional shares is a service provided by the dealer, who is willing to deal with the fractions in their own systems.  The shares actually traded are traded whole.  You can't go to a stock exchange and buy 0.5 of a share.

You can go to a broker and say ""I'd like 0.5 of a share"", and the broker will buy a whole share and then pair you up with someone else who wanted half a share and just perfectly forward all the dividends in proportion to each of you.  Note as well: I'm not talking about ETFs, they're different.

From the articles you linked:

> Not all brokerages offer the option of dollar based investing.
