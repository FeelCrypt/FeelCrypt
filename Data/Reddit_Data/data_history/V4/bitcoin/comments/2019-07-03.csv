"Your buddy is a fool. Bcash is just a fork of Bitcoin that was pumped up by Bitmain for a while in an attempt to scam the market. One easy to miss reason why Bitmain desperately wanted Bcash to succeed was that Bitmain for a while was secretly exploiting a flaw in the Bitcoin proof of work scheme. The gist of it is that the vulnerability allowed a miner to speed up mining by 20% over miners who weren't exploiting the vulnerability. Now 20% doesn't sound too bad on it's own but what you need to keep in mind is that's not just a 20% boost to profit, that's a 20% boost to total revenue for the same costs. Bitcoin mining has some pretty thin margins so for e.g. a miner making 10% margin and spending 90% of their revenue on electricity, building costs, and equipment that added 20% from Asicboost is just pure profit. So now instead of a 20% boost to profit, they now have a 30% margin of profit vs. 10% so it's a 200% increase rather than 20%. Needless to say that earned Bitmain a massive boatload of cash and allowed them to become a very dominant player in the market.

For convoluted reasons when Bitcoin added a backwards compatible upgrade to segregated witness data, that broke the possibility of using covert asicboost that Bitmain relied on, Bcash just forked their own cryptocurrency off starting with the existing blockchain from Bitcoin and increased the maximum block size in a way that broke compatibility with Bitcoin, but did nothing to prevent the type of covert Asicboost that Bitmain was using.

Bcash has no tangible benefits beyond low fees because there's no serious usage of it. They like to claim nonsense like ""instant transactions"" that are in the mempool but not actually committed in a block yet. You can do the exact same thing with just about any cryptocurrency, no one does it except Bcash because it's a retarded idea and until the transaction is actually included in a block and that block isn't orphaned afterwards that transaction is not a sure thing.

There's a reason why Bcash is trading at less than 1/20th the value of Bitcoin. At the all time low after Bitmain gave up trying to pump up Bcash it was trading for less than 1/40th of a real Bitcoin. The market agrees that Bcash is just some garbage altcoin.";1;0;False;MertsA;esnamko;Sooo.. I've found my old wallet back after almost 6 years.;c86sap;https://i.redd.it/k1ns29ifru731.jpg

But taking money out requires a signature by the owner.  Transferring to a bank account number is possible without the owners signature.   Your private key is what you use to sign transactions to spend Bitcoin.  It is truly a digital version of the checking system. However, trustless and signatures are unforgeable.;1;0;False;Adamsd5;esn4ao0;Sooo.. I've found my old wallet back after almost 6 years.;c86sap;https://i.redd.it/k1ns29ifru731.jpg

"pywallet can do two different things. It can find and export your keys from a wallet.dat file, but it can also scan an entire hard drive for a wallet file. This is what you want to do. The command looks something like this:

&#x200B;

python pywallet.py --recover --recov\_size=500Gio --recov\_device=/dev/sda --recov\_outputdir=./recovered\_wallet 

Notes: It only works with python2, not python3. You have to tell it the size of your drive, it can't figure it out on it's own. ""Gio"" is a French abbreviation for Gigabyte (I think).  The command line would be a little different in Windows, eg: --recov\_device=E:";1;2;False;sudomatrix;esolxpd;Sooo..

because in 20 years there'll be no ways to mitigate against any of this risk? I can sweep my wallet  to a new wallet right now and all inherent risk from past instances of reusing addresses is immediately null and void.;1;0;False;farqueue2;esnaj7u;Sooo..
