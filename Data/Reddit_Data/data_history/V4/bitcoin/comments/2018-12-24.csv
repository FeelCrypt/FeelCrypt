"Then you are not a ""Bitcoin guy"". 

This Xmas, only give BTC as gifts. If anybody in your circle want a gift from you, tell them to create a account on an exchange. They can even use your referral link. Then they have to send you a BTC address if they want something from you. You can send them the same amount that you were willing to spend on gifts.

I am doing it this year. So far I have receive 7 addresses!

ðŸŽ„Merry Xmas!ðŸŽ„
