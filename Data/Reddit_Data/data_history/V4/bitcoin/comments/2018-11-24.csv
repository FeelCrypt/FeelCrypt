"> > [...] Just because there's the slightest ""change in magnitude of State influence"" doesn't mean law enforcement is eliminated. [...]

> I feel like you're a victim of the common libertarian flaw/shortcoming, which is understanding government as a relationship between an authority structure and individual citizens. Naturally it's more complex than that and deals in the aggregate, with many different entities including business, zoning, etc. Your relationship to government isn't you vs. them, and naturally the ""law"" isn't just policing property and transnational relationships between individuals.

No, I don't think what I said indicates any of that, or that libertarians in general fail to recognize that individuals in society make up lots of different structures. But really I don't see how this is connected to this thread of the conversation.

> We're talking about public policy here, and the libertarian position is ""there should be less of it""

I could quibble with that characterization, but that doesn't even matter because ""there should be less of it"" doesn't imply that laws are all gone and people will be able to freely go around harming one another.

> Ah yes - back to the naive and very faith-based premise that a private-sector, fund-raised option can not only replace a public one,

Again, the suggestion that looking at something that exists and thinking ""Hey, that thing that exists is actually something that can exist,"" is faith.

> but do a better job at it in a more ethical and trustworthy manner. 

Better job? More trustworthy? Why would these be necessary? Are you saying something that is only as good at this as government currently is would be unacceptable?

Whether the method is more ethical or not is of course subject to analysis.

> Using the libertarian technique of course that a few gated communities in Florida are proof that every neighbourhood ought to carve out its only little volunteer private police village funded by voluntarily donations by home owners, via an HOA, to fund a mercenary speed limit enforcement force.

Of course that's stating the conclusions far too strongly and narrowly based. We're not just talking about a few gated communities, but also other places like some regular, un-gated residential areas. The examples don't offer ironclad proof of anything except that it's possible, and if you think that ironclad proof is required to count as not being faith-based, then I guess you've got a lot of faith in lots of things. According to this test, if you listen to the weather forecast and hear it might rain then taking your umbrella is just completely faith-based, religious activity that outs you as a ridiculous nutjob. Using the term 'mercenary' is just like one tactic used by people opposed to all-volunteer military service, and just as valid.

> What a sensible vision! Silly me for thinking that is absolutely ridiculous.

My criticism is that you're calling it faith-based. Whether you think it's ridiculous or not is irrelevant.

> No - if someone extrapolates recklessly as ""proof""

You're the only one here that keeps talking about proof.

> always

Your word again. Hey, do you have proof that your preferred system always solves everything perfectly?

> You essentially proposed a bucket briage solution to the speeding through the residential neighbourhood example.

No. This is just your imagination. It's like if I reference an existing private firefighting service, with trucks and everything, and you're saying it's a bucket brigade. Maybe you don't know what a bucket brigade is? Perhaps you think the words refer to the method of funding rather than the method of firefighting?

> Wreckless extrapolation is a common afflicition of fundamenatlists and dreamers

Just to be clear though, you seem to be doing the reckless extrapolation here.

> Volunteer fire departments work out in extremely rural areas, so naturally we can all have them everywhere.

As if that's the only method. Also I wonder if you think rural fire departments are all just bucket brigades too.

> At the end of the day, your core ideology is founded on the premise that laws and regulations and policies are, to a great extent, in a number of places where they are either unnecessary, ineffectual, or downright harmful,

No, the ideology is founded on various values. Then various analyses of policies, plus the values, pops out judgements about policies, and then the policies that exist can be checked to see if they're good or bad. Maybe you think the ideology is literally nothing but question begging on those policy judgements such that the final judgements are literally the premises, but in that case you are eliding, again, everything in-between. Whether you can see it or not, it should be clear to any other readers, even non-libertarians who think libertarianism is ridiculous, that the ideology contains more than that. Ignoring those things doesn't show they don't exist.

> and that they got there solely based on the meddlesome proactive expansion of the state

Well, that at least we can agree is completely ridiculous. The idea that a policy came to be as an expansion of the state wherein the state grew to cover new areas by enacting new policies? Insane. That, sir, is obviously a _reduction_ in the size of the state. These new policies are all consequences of _reductions_.

> It's a mix of overly simplistic reductionism, reckless extrapolation of isolated local case studies, juvenile contrarianism against authority, and good old fashioned ignorance-fueled conspiracy theories.

These are just assertions you haven't supported here. But at least libertarianism as been promoted from baseless religion to simply unjustified extrapolation from too-few case studies.

> I'll never forget the shining example of a libertarian analysis of why phosphates have been banned in detergent (as taken from Reason itself). ""Because the government hates your freedom of choice, loves to control you and, doesn't want you to have clean dishes""

Yep. That sounds like literally the whole argument they would have made. I'll bet you've quoted the whole article. I couldn't find it myself to check, but I'm sure that's it. And the author is clearly being literal; It makes perfect sense that there would be a conspiracy of powerful people who are very concerned with ensuring dishes stay dirty.

> Can't put much stuck into people who think we all automatically cooperate and that the only reason we don't is because there's a corrupt authority structure hell-bent on stealing as much freedom and money as it can from us

Yep, that's what I've been explaining this whole time. People just automatically cooperate always and only sinister government agents ever cause anything bad to happen. This totally is libertarianism.

But the amount of BTC you were able or willing to purchase originally, and thus possess in this theoretical future when bitcoin is the medium of transaction (i.e. spendable to a high degree of universality), does depend on its cost at entry. If you're such a believer in BTC that you are willing to hold it based on that idea, then you would likely be one to purchase as much as you could.

Well it might be. People have paid thousands of dollars for something virtual. The price goes up if the interest grows, but goes down if the interest in it declines. What if people actually think this fad of crypto is over and just lose interest in it (This can still mean blockchain as technology gets implemented somewhere, but not as currency). It's not like average joe started using it, I only know like one person in real life (aside myself) who actually uses cryptocurrency and he has litecoin as far as I know. Most people are afraid of investing and are terrified of losing money -> if they see $19000 turn to $1000 in few years they will not ever want to use crypto as real life paying method, they will prefer bank transactions, where money is safe, insured, and doesn't lose value over night (well it does due to inflation, but it's small loss for safety.).;6;1;False;deadlock_jones;eadmoz4;2018 in crypto be like...;9zvk68;https://i.imgtc.com/V4pTW0v.jpg
