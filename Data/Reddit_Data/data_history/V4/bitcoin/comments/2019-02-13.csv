"These allegations relied entirely on online, anonymous chats. Ross has always **denied** the accusations and the govt **never** brought the charges to trial (Ross was sentenced on all [non-violent counts](https://freeross.org/the-charges))

The govt trumpeted these allegations to destroy Ross's public image in the media right after his arrest. If they were certain Ross was guilty, why leave these allegations unprosecuted for years and then later DISMISS them ""with prejudice"" (meaning these accusations can never be used against him again) ?

**Since when do people get a free pass on attempted murder when there is tangible proof they're guilty?**

**Carl Force**, corrupt agent now in prison, had admin access to the site and was admittedly heavily involved in numerous shady plots (one involving a hit on an admin). Even the alleged victim, **Curtis Green**, is a big supporter of Ross and publicly [stated](https://twitter.com/ilovepoker/status/942478630633881600) that Ross is not violent. He even [stated](https://freeross.org/proof-of-multiple-dprs/):

>*“Everybody says there were multiple DPRs. Absolutely. I was DPR once. So if I was, who else was?”*– Curtis Green, former Silk Road admin

&#x200B;

**Serrin Turner**, the govt prosecutor, addressed the jury on the last day of trial:

>**“Now, to be clear, the defendant has not been charged for these attempted murders here. You’re not required to make any findings about them. And the government does not contend that those murders actually occurred.”**

"I’m speaking specifically on drug “crimes”.(ie. distribution, possession) or the war on personal freedom if you prefer. What they SHOULD do is take the money out of the hands of the cartels by legalizing and regulating the substances. More tax money, less prisons and freedom raping. Plus the purity of the substances goes up so no more accidental fent or quinine overdoses (what most heroin OD’s are actually from, not the heroin itself). Narcan would be more easily accessible, further preventing overdoses; people would also be more likely to take someone to an emergency room to be saved if they weren’t possibly going to be held legally liable in some way.

"Exactly. I class it the same as the guy selling drugs on the corner.  He knows he's doing something against the current laws, he knows he can make a lot of money doing it and he's accepted the risk. Silk Road wasn't directly selling drugs themselves but they were helping the buyers and sellers meet to make a deal which has been proven many times in court to be more than enough to lock someone up.    


I think of it like Craigslist.  Guy sets up a site for people to sell stuff.  People sell loads of legal stuff on there like lawnmowers and cars.  But occasionally they might sell prostitution services.  It wasn't setup purely for hookers.  Silk Road was setup TO SELL DRUGS.

He didn't live the life of a criminal even though he did criminal things.  He had no face to face contact with anyone under him which is pretty much unheard of for a criminal of this level when dealing with their network.  A lot of this has to do with the digital medium he used to perpetuate the crimes but when you look at him objectively, you need to consider the disconnect that must have been there for him due to it all being online and digital.  There's a lot of reason to look at it and question whether Ross himself saw it all as ""real"".  Especially when you consider the technology he employed to create his network was perfectly legal and legitimate tech just never used before in this way.

">Given the corrupt agents working the case, it really doesn't take all that much imagination to suppose that the murder for hire allegations were fabricated as a way to sway public opinion.
  
This is my problem with how people defend Ross.  People blindly support him and they are willing to completely dismiss evidence that was corroborated in many ways, including individual testimony in favor of conspiracy backed by zero evidence.  You give more weight to your imagination than corroborated evidence.
  
My biggest problem with this approach is that it doesn't help Ross.  People who are familiar with the evidence and know the facts of the case are radicalized against Ross's case for freedom because of the lies being used to seek his freedom when honesty and forgiveness would work.  No one died because of Ross's mistakes and it is perfectly reasonable that we can all forgive him for trying.

"Ross ordered hits on 4/5 people total. The evidence that he did this is clear. 

No one here likes talking about this because it ruins the narrative. 

Now, the sentence for ordering a hit in California is (IIRC) ten years per contract, so he definitely got a harsher sentence than this, but there were other crimes he was guilty of. 

Not that it'll save me from downvotes, but El Chapo is significantly worse than Ross, and any system that gives Chapo less time than Ross is busted. 

But, to ignore that Ross *didn't* try and have people executed is doing no favors to anyone who wants to have an honest discussion about justice.
