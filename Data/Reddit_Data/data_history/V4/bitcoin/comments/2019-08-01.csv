"It's great to see blockchain even being implemented in different areas! I participated in a campaign called Micro Token Offering ([MTO](https://stp.network/mtoevent/)) presented by STP and win $500 worth Thunder Token with only $20 input. recently. This campaign is very interesting and I want to introduce this campaign to you guys.

MTO participants have a chance to buy high-quality project tokens with a 50% discount. Compared to IEO, MTO is more frequent and low cost. Every week a new project will be initiated and the minimum participation cost is as low as $2.

While IEO participants will take the risk of losing money, MTO secures the profit for participants because the rewards are US dollar-based. The winning chance of MTO is as high as over 40%, with more than 500 winners announced every week.";1;0;False;dawndao;evqebor;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

"**Hearth tax**

A hearth tax was a property tax in certain countries during the medieval and early modern period,  levied on each hearth, thus by proxy on each family unit.  It was calculated based on the number of hearths, or fireplaces, within a municipal area.

Hearth tax was levied in the Byzantine Empire from the 9th century, France and England from the 14th century, and finally in England, Scotland and Ireland in the 17th century.

"The problem is that governments are generally as, if not more, stupid than the masses. When you look at all of the countries throughout history that were heavily centrally planned, they all generally ended in disaster. By contrast, the countries that have thrived tended to be those in which the citizenry had ample amounts of individual freedoms, and the choices of the individual, in aggregate, resulted in far more efficient, productive, and creative economies. The more power is decentralized, the more society prospers, and history testifies to this. The more power is centralized, the more society tends to stagnate and corrupt.

There is this myth that many people seem to hold that government bureaucrats are like Plato's philosopher kings, enlightened and benevolent elites capable of wisely directing the ignorant masses. But the reality is that the motives of people in government are rarely enlightened, governments are almost always rife with conflict between opposing ideologies, lusts for power and advancement, and corruption resulting from the disproportionate amount of power the government has.

If you give government the power to decide which markets thrive and which ones fail, it is inevitable that that will result in profound corruption and the use of government to manipulate markets to make politicians friends and associates rich. People suppose that representation and democracy are enough to offset these corrupting influences, but politics itself inevitably becomes corrupt, money buys elections, and the masses rarely understand what they are even voting for.

And all of that isn't even addressing the fact that bureaucrats rarely understand the interconnected implications of their policy decisions.

You say perhaps the government should tax polluting, and maybe that is correct. But once the government has the power to make those types of decisions, it becomes just as likely that it will use that power to kill clean energy, to subsidize dirty energies, and for politicians to line their pockets and let future generations deal with the fallout.";4;0;False;Ilogy;evpznie;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg
I’m very individualistic. People may hate me for saying this, but I’m not concerned about other people’s poor choices. Life isn’t fair and that’s just a fact. I shouldn’t be forced to help make it “fairer”. Now what I can do (and I do) is help out people I know who are struggling. We don’t have universal healthcare so I have the ability to make the choice and help out a friend who got diagnosed with a crippling illness. But if a friend breaks a leg jumping off a roof, I’m not gonna help that guys bills. He made a dumb choice and now he’s paying for it.

Obviously, if taxes were 100%, people would have no incentive to be productive at all and everyone would stay home. The government would have to force people to work at gun point and people would be very unproductive as there would be no advantage to them in being creative or working hard.
