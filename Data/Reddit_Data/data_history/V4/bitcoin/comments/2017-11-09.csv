"Want to know my issue with hardware wallets? I own a TREZOR, and I keep some funds on it, but I still have a large(r) proportion of my funds on a paper wallet I generated a few years back and have since never imported onto a PC (Or transferred to my TREZOR).

The TREZOR is great against malware attacks, I'll give you that. However, what genuinely scares me is manufacturer attacks. The manufacturer knows that anyone who bought their device obviously has a large amount of BTC (Why'd I spent $100 to secure $5?), and on top of that, they can remotely push firmware updates via the website.

I'm just scared that they could push an update that silently steals the private keys/seed to the device. Hell, if they wanted to be super sneaky, since they already know the value each TREZOR contains (as wallet.trezor.io sends the addresses to their server to check the balance), only steal the top 100 people or so, so that security analysts who probably don't have millions on it receive a ""legitimate"" firmware blob, whereas hodlers with lots of money but (probably) little time to validate each build they receive get a malicious firmware blob.

May I ask what your thoughts on this are? I know I'm not a massive hodler, and don't have millions in BTC, but it'd still be scary for me to lose all of mine, which is exactly why I only keep a small amount on my TREZOR (That I might want to spend), then the larger portion on a paper wallet that ""hasn't been stolen yet""^\(tm\) (But least can't receive firmware updates!).";74;12;False;technifocal;dpleapw;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/

Well, Bitcoin isn’t A PoS, nor is BIP system if I recall.  It takes some arbitrary but valuable percentage of community votes to pass a BIP.  My point is that despite my belief that bitcoin can reach like $20-$50 thou per, I do not believe that Bitcoin will hold market majority forever because asic mining is bound by Moore’s law ATEOD and its less efficient.  I think ultimately 10-20 years out people will use bitcoin out of the fact that it is a mature and developed technology but it will not be alternative number one.  It will be an even more fascinating world if i am wrong though because it means Moore’s law did not set before us a ceiling, but a roof-hatch.;2;1;False;CroptyCrypto;dpk1s1t;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

> If a non-segwit mining majority pushes a segwit-incompatible transaction to the network then that would not only fork the chains into segwit and non-segwit, but the non-segwit chain would allow you to steal all the segwit UTXO:s not coming from the segwit coinbase (meaning that if you spend on the segwit fork with the segwit format, you'll lose those same coins instantly on the non-segwit fork).

> As soon as segwit is active we NEED certainty that nobody important will run non-segwit nodes, otherwise it allows trivial fraud against every node that doesn't fully validate segwit.

> Only if segwit has mining majority AND all major nodes and clients are segwit aware then we're really safe.

What you are reaching for in your comment is really core economics: supply, demand and participant perspective. As there is very little BTC and demand is high, the market participant perspective is currently communicating a lower opportunity cost then FIAT. Ergo, for every dollar you hold you lose the pontential yeild in another instrument namely real estate, ETFs and more recently cryptocurrencies. Simple stuff yes, but this is more in line with what is happening as crypto has become less of a risk and more of an incentive to the community. Where I'm in compelte disagreement is in it being a store of value as we are still in early days. For now, BTC is still an investment vehicle (and a volatile one at that) which has gained concencous on the basis of its inate decentralization and tendancy to inflate relative to the aggregate economy. ;2;1;False;Gallobrax;dpk3tjs;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

The concept of Intrinsic value is an intermediate step towards creating loyalty to a system.  The true value of bitcoin lies in the group’s loyalty to bitcoin as a system, because of what it enables us to do.  Bitcoin didn’t matter when nobody valued it.  Now it has value because people value it.  Thus the only “true value” is the groups collective psychological loyalty to that system of value. That true value can be seen as the number of units in the system.  So if we don’t actually need the intrinsic value system (gold, sha256 hash work energy expenditure) because we’ve defined “true value” as opposed to intrinsic value as our committed loyalty to said system, then proof of stake seeks to establish a system on true value.  We saw the same thing happen when we left the gold standard.

"Well, I reasoned for myself that a 2X bump wouldn't severely threaten the core properties of Bitcoin. 8X, 32X yes, but 2X, no. Also, the Segwit2X agreement initially appeared to have broken the resistance to Segwit and it arguably contributed to Segwit becoming activated. So I initially tried to persuade Core to go along with the 2X for the sake of the unity of the community.

However, I soon saw several things. 1. It truly is too much to expect a hard fork like this in 3 months.  2. There was a stated goal to sideline Core; I never wanted that.  3. There simply wasn't enough consensus, and in the absence of consensus, the status quo is the default best option.

Finally, although I still think a 2X bump in theory would be good right about now, I know that's only a stopgap. The true scaling solution is the Lightning Network. It's stupid to broadcast your coffee transactions, much less your micropayments, to the entire network.

In the end, a 2X bump (theoretically good on its own, in my book) is nowhere near worth the cost of a split community, a split Bitcoin, and the chaos that would come from a rushed fork.

I am extremely happy that the 2x team held off due to the lack of support of the community. It would be better if Bitcoin developed a true voting system among all it's users though......not just the devs and miners. Because, I think the user community was in full support of the ASIC resistance mining upgrade part of the upgrade. So, it's upsetting to see that was prevented from happening. I'm glad to see that coins like Vertcoin already have the best features that Bitcoin was attempting to accomplish by having this hardfork. They also already have a voting system in place. So, it's nice to see coins like that show how popular these truly decentralizeding features are among users. ;1;0;False;Freddit1977;dpjtl8q;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

Bitcoin doesn't behave like a currency it behaves like a speculative commodity or a stock.  It's unstable and its past pattern always corrected it down out of a bubble.  Considering it's at record highs and super unstable, fluctuating by huge amounts day to day, even hour to hour, this is very obviously a bubble built on hype and fueled by market manipulating pump and dumpers.

Nothing significant has changed in the fundamental structure of btc and very little has changed in the context within which it operates.  There's no reason to believe it would behave significantly differently from the past.

All I said is it's quacking like a duck, therefore it's foolish to believe it's anything but a duck without extremely strong evidence to the contrary.  Evidence no one has, especially not in this place.
