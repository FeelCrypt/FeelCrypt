"**Bitcoin**

Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user-to-user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining.

"You are entitled to have your own view but I strongly disagree. Look even on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin 

The first line literally reads:

""Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptoCURRENCY, a form of ELECTRONIC CASH . It is a decentralized digital CURRENCY without a central bank or single administrator...""

You can have your own views on what Bitcoin is and that is fine. I am personally against Bitcoin but that does not mean I will not call it a currency when it clearly is one and claim it does not have value when it clearly does. 

There is a tendency online and with people in the general media who do not understand economics to claim Bitcoin is not backed up by anything fundamental deducing that it is worthless and feel very smug about themselves but they actually do not understand how currencies work in the first place.The only thing that is needed is for people to have belief in the currency and to use it for it to have value which applies to Bitcoin as well. 

I think you are also misinformed on what a collectible is. A collectible is something that cannot be used as a medium of exchange. This absolutely does not apply to Bitcoin since you can literally execute transactions with Bitcoin, which you cannot do with collectibles.

"> Well first of all we have had currencies before governments 

That's neither here nor there. We are talking about how currencies work in the current world. But, to that point, there's a reason we moved away from seashells and goat horns. 

> A person in the USA is completely entitled to REFUSE to use USD payments for their business if they desire so

That doesn't mean USD isn't a currency. 

>  I can still dictate how I value USD from my own perspective irrespective of what anyone else says


OK. Go to a store, tell them you value $1 as $50, and try to buy a $50 item with $1. Let me know how it works out for you. 

You seem to have taken this oddball track of ""Well, if I just redefine the meaning of the word ""currency"", I can call Bitcoin a currency!"" which is a solipsism. 


Bitcoin is not a currency by the definition the rest of the world uses. If you want to hold a different, personal view of what defines a currency, go right ahead, but that doesn't mean the world is going to agree with you. By every modern definition and interpretation economics has given us, Bitcoin is a collectible. Not a currency. ";1;1;False;;eakllh2;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
"Yep, you're right, you only need 25k transactions per second just like the visa network. However, it is what happens after that transaction that will appeal to merchants. In todays world, the transaction is only the first step, followed by days of processing behind the scenes before the merchant receives the money. This can change with crypto.coms vision and this is an incentive. 

Furthermore, merchants will have access to the crypto world of consumers. Incentive two. Finally, those that sign up will be given financial incentive through the gifting of a portion of the merchant acquisition tokens.

As for the customers, the incentive will be given to them through discounts for adopting the new system and again, a portion of the tokens allocated for customer acquisition. ";1;1;False;smithappens84;eakvvm6;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
"Well first of all we have had currencies before governments and people have formed their own currencies in the past independent of governments.  The only thing required for a currency is that people need to accept it as a means of payment, its value does not have to be ""rooted"" in anything, the belief of the people in the system is enough. Similarly, if people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, they are entitled to use it. You CAN use Bitcoin as a currency at the moment and various companies STILL accept Bitcoin payments so it absolutely has a role as a currency and possesses utility in my opinion. 

A person in the USA is completely entitled to REFUSE to use USD payments for their business if they desire so. If I don't believe in the value of USD, I can conduct my business in other currencies. Despite what the markets say, I can still dictate how I value USD from my own perspective irrespective of what anyone else says. The value of a currency is at the core solely contained within the beliefs of the individual users. And if the value starts deviating too much people will start using other currencies, in many countries the population does not use their local fiat, but rather conducts business in USD. They can use Bitcoin as well if they so wish. And this is a good thing, we ideally want to have competition among currencies in a way we want to have competition in markets generally to weed the bad products out.";1;1;False;;eak6z0u;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
"Thanks for the response. It seems like a good idea in general, but very hard to put into practice and get enough people on board to make a dent in the currently accepted standards. Especially if the price continues to be volatile.  

Interested to see how things change in the future, but for myself and many others it's just too risky to get into compared to traditional investments.  

I, and I would assume most other people, would have a hard time giving up all the benefits a credit card gives today. I'll be keeping an eye on it in the future though!

"Serious question, who has ever thought that Visa was too slow? Giving up a ton of consumer protections so your transaction processes in 2 seconds rather than 4 doesn't seem like many people would want to jump on that.

"No worries at all. This is the beauty of crypto.com's vision, the CRO blockchain is the second part of their vision; adoption of a new decentralised system. As you said, this will be a long and difficult road with a 5-10 year plan in the works. 

The first part (which I am currently invested in) is the MCO token. The MCO token is primarily used to reserve MCO visa platinum debit/credit cards. These are obviously built on today's infrastructure and is the bridge to the technology gap that is currently existing in crypto. That is to create an easy way for newbies to not only buy/sell/store crypto, but also spend it.

These cards have huge benefits; up to 2% crypto cashback on all purchases, airport lounge access, referal system, concierge and access to an automated crypto investment portfolio with credit coming soon too. Not only that, they have perfect interbank exchange rates when abroad. This is why crypto needs for adoption.

"A shellfish is not a fish. A cryptocurrency is not a currency.

Bitcoin is not a currency as currencies are issued by governments. You are trying to abstract the idea of barter to mean that anything anyone accepts for anything can be considered a currency. That's not accurate. 

> I think you are also misinformed on what a collectible is. A collectible is something that cannot be used as a medium of exchange.

I know exactly what a collectible is. And as someone who formerly collected and traded MTG cards, you are incorrect that collectibles are not a medium of exchange. In fact, I did the exact same thing with my MTG cards that a person can do with Bitcoin: I sold them for USD and used the USD to buy something. So by your definition MTG cards are a currency, which it is not. 

Sorry man, but changing the definition of what a currency is, or saying ""no one else understands economics but me"", doesn't make it so. Bitcoin is not a currency, and a currency is not defined as ""anything anyone can accept as payment"". You are confusing the economic ideas of assets and currencies. 

Either way I feel this discussion has kind of reached it course, when you change definitions to match your belief, there's no real talking points left anymore since we have move away from facts and towards ideology. Nice chatting with you. ";1;1;False;;eako0us;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
"No the difference with your MTG cards is that you first changed them to USD and THEN used them to buy something.

With Bitcoin you do NOT need to convert them to USD. The idea is that you can use them to buy the good straight away WITHOUT converting to USD. I think there is a lack of understanding on your part on what Bitcoin is/can be used for. Sure, if you go on Amazon you cannot use Bitcoin there (a company can rightly choose what currency they use for transactions) but there are thousands of companies where you can pay DIRECTLY with Bitcoin, which you could never do with your MTG cards. That is the reason why Bitcoin is a currency and why MTG cards are a collectible.";1;0;False;;eakpzz4;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
