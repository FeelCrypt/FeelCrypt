And despite the strict licensing, that is supposed to prevent banking failures (and make all of the dearth of competition a price worth paying), the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS still needed a £65 billion bail-out to stay afloat in 2008 and 2009.

The economic harm from the occasional Icesave is nothing compared to the harm of destroying innovation and competition throughout an entire industry.

They certainly have a right to make their own mistakes, but that does not mean we need to make things harder for them by essentially allowing people to sell them scams. 'Learning from mistakes' usually means them losing a lot of their savings and personally I believe it's unethical to not protect them against that, even if it takes away a portion of their liberty.

Yea well it's not constructive.

> So you believe things like MtGox should continue to be able to happen cause it's the uninformed people who lose money and not you? 

Yes I believe things like MtGox should continue to be able to happen but not because it's other people who would lose money. It's because people should decide for themselves if they will use an untrusted, potentially poorly run company. No one, not you, me, or a regulator, should have the right to make that decision for them.

> And you can't see how that system is doomed to fail in the long run? 

And if it can't succeed because everyone thinks they shouldn't have to pay for someone else's mistakes, then it shouldn't be forced on people. People don't believe they should pay for other people's mistakes, so why should you or I force them to do that? 

>Hey if that's your opinion then fine, but there will come a day when you fuck up and by that point no one will want to help you out. You really believe that sounds like a reasonable way to run a society?

Hey, that's the price of freedom. I don't force you to pay for my mistakes, and you don't force me. If we want long term security, then we have to pay for insurance, but no one will force us to do that.

> The liberty to invest in shady companies?

I edited that line right after you responded to it. The line after the edit is:

>I also don't want to pay for their mistakes with my right as a consumer to choose to use any service provider I want. 

which should answer your question. But on to this particular point about investment, yes, I should be able to invest in ""shady"" (poorly run) companies, and people should be able to patronize shady companies should they choose.

>They certainly have a right to make their own mistakes, but that does not mean we need to make things harder for them by essentially allowing people to sell them scams.

We don't allow people to sell them scams. A scam breaks the law. But what is a ""scam""? Every poorly run company on a shoestring budget that fails and loses their customer's money, or provides a shoddy product? That's just a business failure, not a scam. That's not illegal.

Even in terms of dealing with scams, the right way to stop it is to punish those convicted of running a scam, not punish everyone, with license requirements, to try to prevent scams from ever happening.

>I believe it's unethical to not protect them against that, even if it takes away a portion of their liberty. 

If we believe in liberal democracy, then we have to give them all of their liberty. It's this principle, that people have a right to decide for themselves what is best for them, that is why we give everyone a right to vote. We don't diminish the control they have over their own life, just because we might think they don't know what's best for themselves.

>Though I agree you should be able to opt out of such a system.

If you gave people an opt-out of the regulatory system, I would never complain about regulations again.

"> Your basically just telling me to have ""faith"" in your socialistic agenda.

Quite the opposite. I'm telling you to accept the inevitability of human social progress. I'm telling you to face reality:

*""Before capitalism, there were other ways. Feudalism was what existed in Europe for a thousand years before we had modern capitalism. And before that, slavery - yet another system - another way of organizing who does the work and who gets the profits and so on. And the interesting thing is that every other system that we have a record of in the human race, was born, evolved over time, and eventually passed away.* 

*What always has intrigued me, is the need for those people living in capitalism today, to think it's going to be the great exception. It was born, basically in England 300 years ago, it has evolved over the last three centuries. But when you say, ""yes, but that means it will also pass away and give rise to another system"", people get all kinds of strange worries because they don't want to think about that.*

> Hi all. My name is Jordan Kelley and I am the CEO of Robocoin. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the facts, and share, simply the reality of the relationship with Andrew and Robocoin.  

> To date: Robocoin has shipped units to 18 countries. We are helping to fascilitate the buys and sells of bitcoin in 14 currencies. The following is a disappointing story of a disgruntled, impatient buyer:  

1. Andrew bought a Robocoin kiosk.  

2. Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way.  

3. We delivered the kiosk. Andrew took receipt of the unit.  

4. The kiosk had some hardware failures. My support team worked with them every step of the way. We spent hours on hours working on solutions. My support team, dedicated to their job, was met with constant belittlement and noncooperation from Andrew.  

5. Andrew lost patience and decided he was over it. He shipped the kiosk back to Robocoin's manufacturer.  

6. He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business.  

7. Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds.  

8. Andrew would not come to any type of terms. He chose to threaten as opposed to negote. We offered to resell the unit - he declined. That is not the kind of way we like to do business.  

9. He sent out a horrible tweet - saying that I'm crooked. Something I take personal offense to. Again - we delivered his kiosk, we provided him support. We did our part and we're ready and willing to go above and beyond.  

10. I am always happy to come to a swift and easy resolution. It's disappointing that business is conducted this way and even more disappointing that my company - a team that works every day, tirelessly to the bone, to develop great solutions to enable the world to buy bitcoin - is dragged through the muck.
