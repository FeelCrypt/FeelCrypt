"Hello /r/Pineapplefund. I'm sure you've been completely overwhelmed with requests for support by now but I'd like to add one more if I may. I'd like to request that you consider a donation to the PKP Women's Centre in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. The founder, Sari Pollen works tirelessly to improve the lives of women and their families in her community who have been rendered severely disadvantaged and/or destitute by divorce, bereavement and/or mental/physical health issues and strives to offer support where none would otherwise be available.

"oh, i see

your website made so much money that you just let it die?

LOL

hahaha

good one!

as for ""how's that bitcoin doing??""

well, considering that up still up almost 20K (on an intital 18.5K investment) its doing pretty awesome for me.

my BTC returns are about 60% (amazing for about 10 weeks)

my ETH is much more, maybe 150% or thereabouts 

and litecoin is about the same rate of return or perhaps shightly better overall compared to ETH

And i just started investing in November 2017

So, to answer your question, hows my BTC (and crypto) investing going?

its going amazing.  And make a note, I'm betting it will hover around 11-12 for a bit, but by end of february/march, there will be another big increase in value (personally, i'm actually hoping it will dip down to about 9K for a bit, which will be another buying opportunity for me)

But whatever the case, unless something big happens, I'm just going to HODL (until next november at least) on to what i have, to avoid short term capital gains tax rates on the profits I have seen already.

but either way, i feel so happy to have gotten in when i did, and i cant wait to see how much higher this can go.

Of course, youre just sitting on the sidelines now, out of the game, and not even a player anymore.

Oh well.... real BTC investing is for big boys, you just relax and play with your imaginary websites

Yeah fine I watch the charts and I have alerts for all sorts of bullshit you'd rather not think about. But I have overtaken my pay from my job I started in May also, since September by a significant amount. 

Yeah yeah you can't time the market, but you can sure as anything see a whole ton of buy volume appear after a sell off for a good bounce to trade.

Preach hodl by all means, but remember, if you're willing to risk a little you can make a hell of a lot - as with anything. Technology or not, it's all a gamble anyway.

You're playing a pretty dangerous game. Every day Bitcoin's usefulness as a currency goes down. Networks get overloaded, transaction times delayed, more businesses stop accepting it than start, governments threaten crackdowns, instability drives away people using it for store of value, etc etc. There has to be a ceiling and I think we've hit it, or are very close to hitting it - can you realistically justify such a useless commodity holding a market cap close to major first-world currencies when currently by and large the single largest use case is to make a quick profit in a heavily manipulated market?

"First of all, I didn't say a new coin would be problem-free. I said those with the current socio-economic power, along with governments worldwide, would not allow an old coin from the days of early crypto adoption to be the standard currency. If you think the will of the people will overcome that then maybe we are just having a difference over what we each find realistic. Realistically I don't think the common people have enough power to overcome that fact.

Second, I also don't think the ""coin"" will ever be truly free from regulation. I think the most fair way to ever introduce a coin that is truly set up for worldwide adoption and not investment will be to have a carefully regulated buy-in. Again, I don't think the elite are going to let any switch happen that suddenly invalidates their generational wealth. They are going to want the chance to throw their weight into the system and they will spin it to the common population as the common man's fair shot at owning the coin. Because you also have to realize that for every generationally wealthy person that would lose a lot from having to come into BTC, a lot of working people will lose too. People that have no idea what crypto is and have to be brought in at the very end are going to be the losers of the switch because they will, by default, be buying smaller shares of the new currency.

This is why it's not going to happen and why I think any argument for full-scale replacement is delusional.

Sure, crypto can stabilize and become accepted worldwide. But the minute there is talk of moving wholly to that coin there is going to be people that are just crushed under that transition. It won't happen. I expect crypto to mean a lot to worldwide markets as it becomes a way to buy/sell internationally without converting funds from one fiat (subject to political events and the like) to another fiat (same deal).

Instead bitcoin reached 20K in 2017 lol, and at that point I was hoping bitcoin would crash sooner rather than later so it can rally to 100K MUCH sooner.  It seems that is kinda happening just as I hopped, but you still can't help but feel a LITTLE nervous haha.

Also, in terms of the confidence of people, if they are only price speculating, then they will exit (weak hands) and people more interested in the technological development of the project will have a better chance to enter and hodl.

Then you made $6300 dollars on a $2700 investment! That's outstanding! That's like 233% return on your initial investment, and I bet it was a relatively short time frame. Who cares if you missed out on a peak, sticking to that goal made money.

"No, they aren't. And if they are they are woefully deluded about BTC's specific future.

BTC is too volatile to ever become *the* coin. It was a great public break into crypto but it's never going to become so stable that people feel comfortable using it as real currency. Also there's going to be HUGE backlash from the general public over switching to a currency that will make early adopters/nerds the new societal elite. Because think about it - if you got on this early and we switch over to BTC you had a huge advantage to amass wealth. People won't just stand by and watch that happen.

If the world ever starts to shift towards a crypto, you better believe that the people with existing power are going to figure out a way to make it so that they aren't the ones getting pushed out.

No, it's definitely not luck. It's just selling higher than you buy, not getting greedy, following a disciplined trading strategy, learning how to read charts, etc. Nobody is saying time the market perfectly, but when Charlie Lee sells all his Litecoins, you sell, when the price of Bitcoin undergoes a meteoric rise fueled by social media, you anticipate a cooling of the market and sell.

"Yes you do. Many have made more then 900% + in a year, just by buying and not selling. By many I mean every single person that bought and didn't sell. 

Also this thing happens very often where the btc price goes up 40% then down 20% and all the media shout out that bitcoin has crashed 20% (neglecting to mention the 40% rise in the headline). I see this as fake news headlines and try to buy whenever the price is low. 

Another thing is it has been difficult for those who want to buy BTC to actually buy it recently. For one reason or another, each broker has temporarily blocked new users from signing up. Therefore once the brokers and exchanges are set up to cope with the unprecedented demand to buy bitcoin, its price will rise very quickly.

There has also been another thing happening where people challenge posts like this one, trying to make it look like I am wrong and they are right - but they are probably paid shills working for the banks (who are worried because they are not needed anymore and will all have to close at some point because blockchain technology can't be corrupted like a banker can).

In the future, *if* crypto can get to the point where it is stable enough to be used as a currency then the coin used won't be BTC or likely any coin that was available during the ""Wild West"" days when it would have been easy to buy up huge market shares and hold them.

People have been all over crypto in the media because it's been literally the highest yielding, most accessible investment in recent history. It's a lottery mentality. Everyone wants to play now because they've seen the winners. But that exponential growth cuts two ways. When I invested BTC only needed to gain ~$2.5k USD to double in fiat trade value. Now for a new investor to see that same doubling, BTC has to rise not $2.5k but $10k. So it's four times the growth for a doubling effect. And that's exponential so if it continues to rise it continues to be harder and harder for someone to get the same ""win"" that I got by going in earlier.

"> All of your points are speaking to the same thing - it's all volatile right now and thus cannot be used as a currency in the present.

I don't deny this is true, but anybody that thinks it will stay this way forever is being 100% ridiculous in my opinion.  People keep harping on this point as if its never going to change.  We live in the information age where things can change in the blink of an eye.  How long did it take before smartphones went from first release to now being widely owned by a large portion of the population including even children?  How much of a stretch is it to imagine all these people with smartphones now using it to trade crypto with each other?

In my opinion, the question isn't ""Should I invest in crypto?"", the question is simply ""Which coin do you think will win out?"".

> In the future, if crypto can get to the point where it is stable enough to be used as a currency then the coin used won't be BTC or likely any coin that was available during the ""Wild West"" days when it would have been easy to buy up huge market shares and hold them.

I don't understand why you think this.  If anything, a coin is more likely to see widespread adoption because it has a long history that proves it is reliable and safe versus a fresh new coin that is unknown and has no history of usage.  Why do you believe that the opposite is true?  I'm not hating, I'm just trying to understand where this viewpoint comes from.

> When I invested BTC only needed to gain ~$2.5k USD to double in fiat trade value. Now for a new investor to see that same doubling, BTC has to rise not $2.5k but $10k.

And that's exponential so if it continues to rise it continues to be harder and harder for someone to get the same ""win"" that I got by going in earlier.

I don't see how this is relevant to BTC gaining widespread adoption.  If anything, it shows that larger % swings in price are more difficult as the price rises, which lends towards more price stability.  You're just explaining how percentages work in general, which can apply to the price of literally anything.  

My hope is that, in the near future, people won't buy BTC to see big gains, they'll buy it because its more convenient than putting their money in a bank.  They can access it 24/7, instantly, and send it to anybody, anywhere and not have to answer any questions from anybody about who they sent it to or why.

I agree that there will be a lot of barriers and challenges for any coin to overcome in order to see widespread adoption, but I don't accept that all current coins have an 'extra' barrier simply by existing currently.

"I mean you don't have to agree with me but I've already said everything I have to say to your points - I don't see any way in hell that the world will allow a coin that was widely available and picked up by early adopters/techies/people in it for lack of government tracking/etc to be the ""one true coin"" that we all move over to IF that even happens in the first place.

Governments won't allow that. The people will all the social power won't allow that. It would take worldwide revolution on a scale that's never been seen to make a current coin become the coin that is worldwide standard currency to replace currency backed by fiat.

If you don't understand why the world isn't going to shift to the first coin that got early adopter status and recognition in the media then I really have nothing left to say. Good luck holding and re-investing. I don't think it's a long-term smart move.

"> BTC is too volatile to ever become the coin.

All of crypto is volatile right now.  You make it sound like BTC is the only one.

> it's never going to become so stable that people feel comfortable using it as real currency.

I'd like to borrow the crystal ball you're using that told you this.  It's volatile right now because its future is uncertain and because the market is small enough that large individuals or coordinated groups can manipulate it.  The more widespread BTC (or any crypto) becomes, the more difficult it will be to manipulate.  

> Also there's going to be HUGE backlash from the general public over switching to a currency that will make early adopters/nerds the new societal elite.

I didn't see a single person concerned about this during the October-December crypto media frenzy.  I'm sure there are lots of early adopters that made money off that.  Most people aren't worried about their bank usage making banks rich, why would they give a shit about crypto making early adopters rich?  People will want to use crypto because it will (hopefully) be useful to them and improve their life and they won't care about stupid side effects like this.

> you better believe that the people with existing power are going to figure out a way to make it so that they aren't the ones getting pushed out.

I will agree this is a major concern with crypto as a whole.  This is also why people need to be very wary of up and coming alt-coins and why it is so important for people to understand the technology behind the coins.

"Okay. Yet it has the widest adoption of any other cryptocurrency, can be liquidated for fiat and people are selling heir homes and cars for bitcoin. It’s still accepted at Microsoft, Overstock, and several other outlets. Fees today are about $1-$2 - partially because of segwit adoption, partially because the mempool isn’t being spammed, partially because exchanges are beginning to batch their transactions, and partially because there’s less transactions currently in the queue. Lightning adoption is on its way. You can see how hungry the community is and how many lightning projects are already coming to life.

Yes, there is a coordinated attack to keep bitcoin suppressed as long as possible, which is why I give it a 50-75 percent chance of succeeding. If you’re unhappy with bitcoin and don’t believe it will succeed, then that’s fine. It’s a risk to invest. So is any cryptocurrency, or any stock or asset for that matter.

"This comment is filled with so much stupidity.. and yet you call others dumb...

>There are plenty of people who trade for a living

No there is a very small minority of investors that day trade. The vast majority of people that try will and do fail. No one should ever recommend that someone else day trade.

>If you sell higher than you purchased, rebuy at a lower rate and it keeps falling, how is that any worse than just holding

Hodling is equivalent to going long on a traditional investment. You're making a bet that in the long run the price will go up. That's not 2 weeks, 1 month, or even 6 months. It's a bet that if I check back in multiple years the price will have increased and I can make a sell decision at that point. It literally doesn't matter if the price drops for 6 months consecutively as long as after 5 years it has still gone up since the start.

When you sell, rebuy at a lower rate, and it keeps falling is bad gambling behavior. When it keeps falling do you think that retarded, noob day trader is going to hodl? No they are going to sell again and take their losses. Then when it starts going back up they are going to buy in again because they think it's going to rise and then it drops on them again and they sell because they are idiots trying to day trade and they lose again. Then another time it goes up, they buy, it continues going up, they sell because they are predicting the downfall, then it keeps going up, they buy again, then it crashes, then they sell. Oh look, they got fucked again!

Look I’m all for HODLing, I’m just saying if it will help you out now take 10-20% of your total assets and your initial investment. If by doing that somehow wipes out all of your investment then you’re already losing money and should have sold a while ago or you’re taking yourself out too early.

I keep hearing that. But as a risk adverse spectator who is fascinated but watching from the sidelines like me, what ""proof"" of that can you give me? (serious question) 

From my point of view the dollar is not losing and gaining value in such wild amounts on a daily basis, but Bitcoin is (and other cyrptocurrencies). On all the exchanges that I peek at time to time they are all listing Bitcoin in terms of US dollars. I haven't seen one that is listing US dollars in value of Bitcoin/satoshis.

"Interesting. Thanks for the reply. 

Have you ever just made a simple goal? Like: I will sell when I make 15%. And then I will buy again at 12,000. Then when you buy in again, the next goal would be waiting till you make 15% again (which would be 13,800). ""Good"" investment analysts tend to give this kind of advice; Make goals. A buy goal and then a sell goal. Then stick to it. Oh, and also re-evaluate your goals at least once every 3 months. I'm generalizing for any investment or market.

Those goals can change, like if you think it will go waaay higher than 15% on a trend of the moment, you can change to 25%. And if you reached your goal and you sold to get your gain, but the trend is still up up up, then you can buy in again at current price and set an new X% goal. If you are unlucky and the price dropped after you bought in, it's not a loss until you sell. To me, that's the time period ""HODL"" should apply, just wait till you reach your goal. It's up and down so much in cryptocurrency you don't have to HODL as long as traditional markets. Right? 

That's what I THOUGHT ""HODL"" was about, hold until you reach a goal/profit. But then I see posts like this one today and I wonder, what is the point of holding if you never sell. I never thought about waiting till other currencies 'fail'. I don't really see that happening until a lot of older generations are in the ground and cryptocurrencies values don't jump hundreds of percent points up AND down inside of a week. Personally I like that cryptocurrencies have value based in concrete measurable scarcity but I don't like the 'non-regulated' part. Regulations are like safety rules at work, there's a story behind everyone of them. I'll start worrying about the US dollar when the dollar is valued on exchanges in Bitcoin, not the other way around. But hey, that's my risk level and I acknowledge everyone is different in risk level. I also acknowledge in the very long term that is a possibility. 

Well, anyway. Thanks for reading. I don't have any Bitcoin, but I've been watching and learning. I still don't understand it all, but I'm getting there. I still don't know what exchanges can be trusted after learning about 2013, after all this talk about outrageous fees, after people not being able to get their Bitcoin changed back to US$, and seeing all the Coinbase drama and insider trading this year. But it's very fascinating to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens after the next halving, the long term evolution of those that mine, and what will happen when all the coins are mined. It's a historical story. It's history I'm getting to witness first hand as it unfolds! That alone is very cool to me.

"But that is about as unrealistic as flying pigs right? Especially with the crazy volatility. 

Even if it does stabilize one day—which would require government backing and regulation to guard against the flares of speculation—it may do so at a much lower price, maybe even $100, at which time the HODLers will have lost a ton of money right?

I've never invested a single 'real' penny of any traditional currency, but in December I was able to pay my rent, bills, and feed myself with my bitcoin holdings. Dips don't scare me at all, any drop in price is just as exciting as any gain. The only thing that is mildly frustrating to me is when the price remains stable, which fortunately doesn't happen often. And even when it does I get to shrug my shoulders and just remember that when I calculate my profit versus my initial investment, I'm dividing by zero.;2;0;False;lahalol;dt2ui91;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

My belief is that BTC and other cryptos will either be worth A LOT more in 5 years, or worth not much at all. I try not to worry too much about the day to day or even week to week price changes. I don't check the value of my house or 401K every day or even every month either - and with that mindset - i tend to not lose as much sleep over price swings up or down.;2;0;False;gopher33j;dt2tllc;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

I think the HODL mentality works well not only for crypto, but also for the stock market and really all investments... buying and holding for the long road seems to always work out better anyway and then you don’t get caught up in short run garbage... when you get emotional on short term things you make poor decisions... my advice to everyone e on really anything is “Care Less”;1;0;False;YellowFIGFinance;dt2eokg;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

Then you see 50% of your portfolio gone and you just realise that its just an attribute of crypto market.

"The whole market does care. After this whole hype period, what are seeing is a selloff after people are losing confidence. Also negative media attention and what not.

The project did promised decentralisation, privacy, censor resistance, fast p2p transfers... Now, I still believe in Bitcoin, but most people that joined this last year are in it just for the money ( nice but kind of missing the point ).

Bitcoin needs to prove itself once again with more adoption of users/merchants and adoption of its scalability solutions. 

This whole ""just hodl"", ""to the moon"" herd mentality is not constructive, neither it helps the newest people understand the purpose, current stage and future of the project.

"I think it is foolish to hold now. i have called this before. Once the CME got involved with bitcoin, I knew bitcoins days were numbered. Just look at this: https://twitter.com/whalecalls This is big orders shorting bitcoin and their are more and more contracts going for lower and lower amounts. They are gonna short this thing to 0. Bitcoin has to many enemies. Banks, other shit coins, governments, etc. They want it destroyed. Look at all the negative stories. Look at all the tax and regulations being put on it. But the futures are fine. Remember wallstreet fatcats said ""we will tame bitcoin"". This is what taming looks like folks.

They will put the miners out of business. The exchanges. Regulate it to hell. EVERYTHING. Then hold it all for themselves. No matter the lightning networks or segwits you add. They know they cant go after the IDEA of crypto. But they can make the MARKET around it so toxic, noone wants in.

Now I could be wrong and this goes to 100k in JULY. I think people who think that are looking back with rose colored glasses. I have traded before. I see what is happening. This is an unregulated market. Their are grifters and con men. Their are greedy wallstreet firms and powers that be that want everything for themselves. Please invest cautiously.
