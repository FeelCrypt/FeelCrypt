"While you're entitled to that view, I'm not sure I understand it.  Use as a currency tends to lessen the impact of the volatility.  Money comes in, money goes out.  As long as those things are happening with some reasonably small time interval, it doesn't tend to matter whether something is 10BTC or 10mBTC.

Any savings I have left over tend to just stay in my cold wallet, and despite the recent drop, have - as I said - gone up over 10000% since I started, so I'm pretty comfortable with it.";1;1;False;dalebewan;e4rgdb6;Spot on;99wuy4;https://i.redd.it/1an1jsec81i11.jpg

Honestly though, I was mostly just making kind of a joke.
