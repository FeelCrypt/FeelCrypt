"Hey, thanks for the reply. You state some valid points and have given me some things to think about. 

You argue that QE can be considered ""less unfair"" than a depression. I suppose you *could* be right, but this is a hard point to give evidence for, as the only examples we have are old market crashes that happened before there was a huge derivative market propping up currency markets. This kind of ties in with your point about the 2008 crash. It is pretty common knowledge that the crash was a result of fraudulently valued, 'stacked' derivatives and credit ratings that were falsely represented. 

> my guess is you mean that it basically artificially inflates confidence? My counterpoint would be, it's not any more artificial than any other aspect of currency, bitcoin or otherwise.

Yes, that's exactly what I meant. And I believe it *is* more artificial than aspects of currency because it leads investors to make more investments, and riskier investments, because they believe a crash would be less likely, with the QE ""safety net"" (and I'm inclined to believe them). With Bitcoin, the market cap is already set into the protocol so there is no safety net. 

You probably saw the wobbles in the market when the Fed announced the tapering of its QE program. This is evidence that some of the confidence in the markets is artificially propped up by the idea of QE.

> I don't follow this argument at all. What evidence do you have that larger currency bases are less volatile? We just watched a gigantic market crash in 2008, one so large that it took the largest currency intervention in human history to simply make it a huge recession instead of a literal Great Depression V2.0 - and the ""market cap and liquidity"" in that market was literally the entire market cap and liquidity. All of it.

OK, I take your point here - QE definitely eased the pain of the 2008 crash. However, the crash was a result of the derivatives and misleading ratings that I mentioned earlier. I guess this is not so much a point against QE, but more simply an argument in favour of the Austrian school of thought - ie we should let markets naturally assume their own value, based on the collective belief in their worth.

As to my point about greater market cap and liquidity, well I believe that this is true - many of the currencies with the largest market cap and liquidity show the least volatility - put simply, it's harder for an entity to move the price of an asset or currency when they need more of that asset or currency to do so. This seems obvious to me, maybe I'm missing something?

Although we saw a huge market crash in 2008, this is not evidence that bigger market cap/liquidity does not prevent volatility. All it is, is an example of a large market that *did* experience volatility.

My counter evidence would be simply looking at the value of the currencies/assets in the world that have the highest market cap, and noting that they experience low volatility, and specifically their volatility is over long periods of time. The ones with lower market cap and liquidity are more volatile over shorter periods of time.

> when currency is appreciating, people begin to view it as an investment tool and use it to store wealth instead of spending it.

When people need food, they buy food. When they need a car, they buy a car. Fuel, shelter, clothes, same deal. People don't spend their money because they think it will be worth less tomorrow, they spend because they need or want something. 

As an example, look at all the depreciating assets normal people buy - phones/computers/cars etc. They quite often don't need these things (or at least they don't need to spend as much as they do on them). 

Assets like new cars and phones have huge depreciation - probably between 10% and 30% in the first year of ownership, yet people buy them. They are exchanging a currency with 1-5% inflation for assets with much higher depreciation.

Granted, if the currency had a *guaranteed* large deflation rate, perhaps people would hold off on buying that 2nd car that they don't need. But:

A. An deflation rate of currency is never guaranteed.
B. I believe if they held off on buying that 2nd car for a year, and their currency had increased significantly in value, they would buy a better car.

I have to admit, I don't have much hard evidence for this idea that a deflationary currency is a good thing, but I just don't accept the arguments to the contrary... They seem illogical to me. If you have any evidence where this has actually happened (a deflationary currency causing a significant economic crash) I'd love to read about it.

> It's really easy to argue against a current system when you point out all the worst aspects of the current system and handwave stuff like ""well sure we have no way to prevent another Great Depression, but it's a feature, not a bug!""

Point taken. However I think you are a being a little hyperbolic. Bitcoin will not be a replacement for a currency such as the USD for many years (if ever). But there may be other ways of preventing depressions other than classical QE.

Just a mad thought, but how about some sort of universal basic income? Instead of sending the QE money directly into the financial markets, it could be distributed evenly between the population. People would then spend the money directly, stimulating the economy.

">It is pretty common knowledge that the crash was a result of fraudulently valued, 'stacked' derivatives and credit ratings that were falsely represented.

Absolutely agreed - but I think perhaps this highlights that we're not talking about exactly the same thing. The kind of market manipulation you're talking about is distinct from the kind of manipulation executed by a governing body, in my opinion.

To put things a different way - I cannot QE bitcoin. But I could do exactly what was done in 2008 to Bitcoin, in terms of market manipulation and over-leveraging the currency. Removing one avenue of manipulation doesn't inherently make other avenues of manipulation more difficult.

>Yes, that's exactly what I meant. And I believe it is more artificial than aspects of currency because it leads investors to make more investments, and riskier investments, because they believe a crash would be less likely, with the QE ""safety net"" (and I'm inclined to believe them).

The problem is that this behavior was happening before QE ever happened. You might be right *now*, but in 2008 there was a huge question mark - maybe the feds would just let all the banks fail? Maybe everyone would just lose their house?

If a ""promise"" from the Government that it would support the industry after it utterly fucked itself was a necessary condition for the industry utterly fucking itself, the 2008 crash never would have happened. Nobody had any confidence that the government would step in and print trillions of dollars to salvage the economy.

Basically, I think you have your chicken and your egg backwards. A promise about QE isn't necessary for the banks to go apeshit and do crazy shit with money, it's necessary to convince everyone ELSE to participate in a system that they now know is rigged. The banks are gonna go bank either way. QE is what convinces everyone else to participate despite their disadvantage.

>As to my point about greater market cap and liquidity, well I believe that this is true - many of the currencies with the largest market cap and liquidity show the least volatility - put simply, it's harder for an entity to move the price of an asset or currency when they need more of that asset or currency to do so.

You're not missing anything exactly - the larger the currency base is, the harder it is for any individual to affect. The problem is, that's a double edged sword. If Bitcoin had a very large currency base, it would be very hard for even a group of individuals to destabilize it. However, that also means it's nearly impossible for a group of individuals to STABILIZE it. For example in a world without the Federal Reserve, a private group might set a 'floor' and say OK, we're gonna buy bitcoin for $1.00 per coin no matter what. With a small market cap, that means that a group of individuals can basically guarantee that bitcoin will be worth a dollar. With a large market cap, you can no longer rely on independent or loosely organized groups to do this - because the harder the crash is, the more incentive people within the group have to be the first to sell. I.E. if ten people agree to the $1.00 floor, and bitcoin crashes incredibly hard, each of us is holding fucktons of bitcoin that are ""really worth"" less than $1.00, and there are only 9 other people currently buying bitcoin, sooooo I have a huge incentive to break the deal while ANYONE is still buying bitcoin.

To try to get to the heart of the matter - you're looking at crashes as artificial events that are driven by something. In reality, capitalism has an inherent boom/bust cycle, and modern economic policy is largely built around managing this cycle - making the busts small and short, making the booms long. As far as anyone knows, it's impossible to have capitalism without this cycle. Currency management is the primary tool used to make busts small and short, and also to ""moderate"" booms - a 'fast' boom has a lot of wealth generated and lost quickly. We want 'long' booms, not 'big' booms. So currency management allows us to slow down and extend a boom - so we have 10 decent years and 1 bad year, instead of 5 good years and 5 bad years.

>I have to admit, I don't have much hard evidence for this idea that a deflationary currency is a good thing, but I just don't accept the arguments to the contrary... They seem illogical to me.

Your logic here is bulletproof - nobody is going to starve to avoid spending a bitcoin. But the problem is that from an economic perspective, we're not actually terribly worried about you buying food or paying rent. What we're really really worried about is whether you'll go to the movies or go on vacation this year. What we're really worried about is the death spiral that starts when individuals start saying ""sure, I need to buy food, but I think Disney World can wait til next year, and we'll just have a small Christmas"".

The scary thing about a recession is that like a bank run, it's self fulfilling - you think the bank is out of money, so you go take all your money out of the bank, so the bank runs out of money. Deflationary currency doesn't *cause* a recession, but it sets up circumstances under which recessions trigger more easily. When money is constantly becoming more valuable, people are always looking for reasons NOT to spend it. Which sounds great if you're all rah rah anti-capitalist, but if you like how things currently work, it's really antithetical to our system functioning. A recession is really just a bunch of people with money not spending it, and a bunch of people who have jobs that rely on other people spending money suddenly being unemployed. At that point, things start to cascade up the chain.

>Just a mad thought, but how about some sort of universal basic income? Instead of sending the QE money directly into the financial markets, it could be distributed evenly between the population.

I still think this is how QE should have been done. One of the big dangers, though, is the ""What if they just pay down their debt"" question - because that's exactly the opposite of what you want. The assumption was that keeping existing corporations running and employing people had value. I think 2008 was very interesting because it's really the first time in human history that a major depression was actually averted/delayed. Unfortunately, I think the next time we do QE, we'll do it exactly like we did this time, if only because *it worked at all* and a lot of people are still stunned about that. I think there's a certain level of ""holy shit if it actually can avert a depression DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING DO IT EXACTLY LIKE THAT AGAIN"" simply because the consequences of an actual depression are so horrific and long lasting that they basically define entire generations.

>Point taken. However I think you are a being a little hyperbolic. Bitcoin will not be a replacement for a currency such as the USD for many years (if ever). But there may be other ways of preventing depressions other than classical QE.

I agree there's a certain amount of hyperbole here - I'm used to people preaching the immediate end of all non-crypto currencies when I come in here. ;) 

There are almost certainly other ways of preventing depressions, and I doubt QE is the 'good one' - it's just hard to give it up when it's the only one we KNOW works at all.";1;0;False;Zaeron;djnhpc3;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
