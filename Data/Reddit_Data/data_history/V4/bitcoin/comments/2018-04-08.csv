basic economics: all bubbles have the same chart, and they all fail the same way. 

Also: there is nothing stable, steady, or predictable in the BTC price since 2010, except that the chart mirrors all other bubbles.  How does a huge rise, then a steady downturn seem like a steady rise to you?

If not that the fact that he let them take pictures without thinking to say at the very least ""hey, let me see that thing real quick and check the settings""

The killer left DNA at the scene but Belize doesn't have a national crime lab with the ability to analyze such things. 

The story I recounted above comes directly from independent accounts given by the caretaker of his compound that transfered the money and places the killer at the scene at the time of the murder and John's main girlfriend who confirmed above along with adding the part about using the other girl as bait/ to set the stage for the execution. 

The killer himself gave a rather unconvincing denial. Claimed to have been at a wedding in a different part of the country that night despite multiple indepent sources placing him on the island, and himself has since fled Belize as well.

"In a western nation, yes. 

- The killer left DNA evidence at the scene. Belize has no DNA labs to test & use this to solve the case. 

- the caretaker and paymaster of his island compound transferred $5,000 to the account of the bodygaurd implicated in the murder the morning before it occurred. Furthermore the caretaker was called by the bodygaurd the pick him up near the murdered man's house and bring him back to John's compound between 3 and 4 am the night of the murder. Multiple girlfriends assert the bodygaurd being present at the home in the morning and not having been there the previous evening. 

- Johns main girlfriend attested to the facts of the above independently, and added the bit about the other girl being used to distract the man/ set the stage for the assaination. 

- the bodygaurd, when confronted when the above, was curious who had said such thing, smirked and gave a very unconvincing denial. He has since fled the country after claiming there had been several attempts on his life. His aliabi for the night of the murder was a wedding in a different part of the county, Despite numerous witnesses placing him at John's house the morning after the murder. 

- John fled the country never facing questioning. He bragged about this. His bragging got him caught. 

He never addressed the praticulars of the murder but instead concocted a story about the entire government of Belize wanting him dead due to his failure to bribe a key prominant national political party via donations. 

**Edit**

I also don't give a shit about his fetishes. 

I do care very much that at least one very credible US citizen claims that he drugged and raped her. 

It also establishes a pattern of credibility in relation to those speaking of his actions & behaviour. That is a very odd & specific thing for all parties asked to mention.

I don't give a fuck about what he and other consenting adults do with each other but woman after woman independently saying he had them shit in his mouth doesn't leave a lot of room to doubt the veracity of their accounts.

No action was ever taken by police or local government as John had donated thousands in equipment and donations to the local police. They turned a bind eye to his actions. 

There wasn't much recourse left for the neighbor or larger community, not justifying it, but it's not like John ran next door in killed the guy in an act of passionate revenge.

Before the showtime doc (now on netflix) I didn't take the guy seriously but found him amusing as a truely excenteic tech millionaire. 

Almost turned it off because the first few minutes started to feel like a hit-piece. It wasn't. In the least... 

Those who doubt my timeline presented are free to watch it and then check the sources from the time periods in question.

The story it tells seems the closest we're ever going to get to the truth.  

John refuted the charges levied against him in Belize as a corrupt government intent on nothing more than killing him, never addressed the actual claims. 

John refuted the document by claiming the producers were in league with a rival gang that wanted him dead. He said that showtime was free to just pay him $500 million to avoid litigation on it. To my knowledge he has yet to sue... Wonder why... 

All accounts in the doc come from people who were in his employ, given freely without coerscion or compensation. 

They directly implicate him of the following:

1. The drugging and rape of a Harvard educated American researcher working in his Orange Walk compound's lab

2. Ordering an assult on a rival gang leader that resulted in the man's death. 

3. Paying for and arranging the circumstances of the execution of his neighbor in San Pedro, who was a retired American contractor.

"100% agree with your points. 

McAfee admits freely to shilling for hire yet this shit is upvoted to the top of the BTC sub.

Either everyone here thinks they're smarter than the markets or a lot of people take it seriously. 

Either way it doesn't look great to the general public nor does it help the long term legitimacy, and thus valuation, of BTC to so highly promote such a crass, stale, and oft used anecdote tweeted by such a dubious character. 

This is /r/wallstreetbets tier content. 

Though given the commonalities between the way they worshiped Skhrelli and many are adulating McAfee here I'm guessing there is more overlap there than would be... Desirable. ";11;0;False;garynuman9;dx0tc3u;Legendary story by John McAfee;8ao4mx;https://i.redd.it/rr2mgkcmimq01.png

"When he lived in Orange Walk the guy he had his security staff ""put a scare into"" that they accidentally killed was indeed the leader of a rival gang. 

His neighbor he had executed in a peaceful expat island beach community of San Pedro was Gregory Faull,  a retired American contractor from Maimi in his 50's. He main gripe with McAfee was the attack dogs and literal gang members from Orange Walk Town McAffee brought back with him scaring the hell out of tourists and residents by you know, looming menacingly with high caliber rifles 24/7 on an otherwise normal peaceful beach...

"Well... To be fair. 

1. *He* didn't murder his neighbor. He paid one of his bodygaurds in Belize $5,000 to murder his neighbor, who was distracted and door left unlocked by another one of John's girlfriends who left the bar with the man. 
He wanted the neighbor dead for posioning his dogs, who were vicious and prevented the public from traversing the beach on John's property. 
The neighbor was fond of walking to the bar like a few hundered meters from his & John's homes down the beach. 


2. The girls weren't underage (in Belieze, at his 'heart of darkness' property), but were prostituting themselves.
All indicated John had no interest in traditional sex and had a hammock with a hole cut in it and was really into poop stuff. You can fill in the blanks...

3. The GRU that raided his compound didn't find any drugs. 
They found what they believed to be an amphetimine but it did not test as such.
Just months prior the lab on his property was being used for legitimate research. 
We know this because he drugged and raped the researcher who partnered with him when she quit. **Edit for further accuracy** - it didn't test as anything that could be *prosecuted as a drug in Belize*. It very well could have been an ananlouge or RC. There was DNA evidence left at the scene of his neighbor's murder. There isn't a single DNA lab in Belize, and they only recently had their first conviction partially reliant on fingerprint evidence. The bodygaurd implicated in the murder by both John's former caretaker & bottom bitch has since also fled the country after attempts on his life. 

3. He fled the country (Belieze) before he could be questioned about the murder. 
EXIF data (lol) from photos that accompanied an article done by Vice led to his arrest in Guatemala for sneaking across the border.
Per his admission he faked a heart attack to avoid the narrow window Belieze had to demand his extridition before it could be blocked by petition. 
He was then summarily tossed on a plane back to the US as Guatamala didn't want the headache of jailing him. 

-----

So yeah, total piece of shit, but at least be accurate as to why. 

**Edit 1: additional context**

It's scary to see how many people here defend the man. 

Cryptocurrencies are a great combo of the man's dual lifelong interests of making a quick buck off the technically ignorant & starting a cult. 

Don't forget before he went all Colonel Kurtz in Belize he spent a decade or so as a Yogi leading 'free' retreats at his former compound in Colorado... Where the locals claimed he was more or less trying to start a cult. 

..and that before he was bought out his anti virus company was by all accounts a cult of personality that revolved around pleasing John & had an internal culture akin to that of like... Atari in the 70's. 

But yeah take the man's advice on stuff. He's clearly a straight shooter. No BS. Nope, not at all.  

**Edit 2: TL:DR timeline of John**

- McAfee Security, cult like sexually charged corporate atmosphere. Took buyout when he was deemed to be unfit to be part of expanding the company & going public.

- Built massive yoga retreat in Colorado, locals claimed he was starting cult. Numerous failed social network startups  during this period. Wrote 5 books on meditation and acted as Yogi. Got bored, closed down and auctioned off after he lost (or perhaps not, depending on when asked) 90% of his worth 2008-2010.  

- moves to expat island Paradise in Belize, builds beach compound. Gets bored. Partners with researcher. 

- buys large tract of land in inner Belize. Notes that he is only white Westerner in an area that is like 13% of country. Insanely high murder rate where 97% of cases are unsolved. Builds compound with lab. Cultivates harem of local women and a security force of the worst local toughs by purchasing loyality in an area of the world where poverty is endemic and life is cheap. Buys loyality and blind eye of local police. Security murders at least one other gang leader at his behest as John fears the man intends to attack him. Fleas that compound after being raided by national Gang Retaliation Unit, who is feared and seen as uncorruptable. 

- returns with entorage to peaceful expat island paradise compound. Entorage and bizzare paranoia prove unpopular here. Culminates in posioning of dogs and murder of also expat neighbor. 

- flees country like coward, concocts bizzare paranoid story of persecution. Using $, purchased influance, and a faked heart attack to get tossed back to US. 

- moves to middle of nowhere, again seems concerned with buying the blind eye of local sherrifs. Gets DUI while carrying several guns. 

- runs as libertarian cantidate. Loses to Johnson, begins to rehab image by commenting in the press on security issues, which inexplicably the press still affords him credibility on. 

- parlays this rehabed image into shilling crypto. Some of you guys take this fucking nut seriously. The cycle continues.

"What a character. Founded the McAfee Antivirus Program. Arrested in Belize for unlicensed drug manufacturing and owning an unlicensed weapon (didn't see anything about the sex slaves). Apparently he hired his security to kill the neighbor after he poisoned McAfee's security dogs. He then fled to Guatemala and pretended to have heart attacks so that his lawyer could get him deported to US instead of back to Belize. Belize then sold off his stuff and McAfee's house burned down ""under suspicious circumstances"". He also tried to run for president in the 2016 election as a Libertarian (He was born in England so I don't know if he would have qualified in the first place).

">If someone were to not invest or spend their money in order to benefit from its greater buying power next year, they would be giving up consumption and the gains from investing in companies whose growth outpaces deflation.

If its always possible to invest in companies above the rate of deflation, why would anyone be invested in anything less profitable than that? Why isn't everyone only invested in the companies that have the highest growth rates?

You're already presupposing in this hypothetical that no one would be invested in anything less than the deflation rate, so of course in that hypothetical, deflation would not make money hoarding more profitable than investment and so wouldn't initiate a deflationary spiral.

Economies don't work like that, they're not zero sum, there is no floor on profitability and you would get extreme diminishing returns if everyone pulled their money out of lower return investments and put it in the most profitable businesses, which is why people don't do it.

Profitability is not a signal of how important something is, or how much wealth an industry generates, its most often a sign of inefficiency and lack of competition. The most efficient industries are locked in aggressive competition that drives prices as close down to cost as possible and keeps margins low. It's these kinds of businesses that are destroyed in deflationary spirals first, because it moves money away from these important efficient businesses and into more profitable but less efficient areas of business.

In the 1930s, casinos and speakeasys were booming, whilst 1 in 3 farms shut down, while millions were suffering from malnutrition. This is the kind of distortion deflation causes by encouraging people to ""just invest in the most profitable businesses"". Economies can't function properly if the money supply is distorting the baseline profitability of businesses.

Say you have 1% deflation. So everyone who's invested in something that provides less than 1% return pulls out for cash. This now pulls a bunch of money out of circulation and decreases the money supply, so now the deflation rate goes up even higher, its now 2%. So now anyone making less than 2% (which is an even bigger number of investments), pulls their money, which increases the deflation rate. That's how it becomes a spiral.";1;1;False;suninabox;dx11z2q;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

">Deflationary spirals are called spirals because a small amount of initial deflation can increasingly reward pulling money out of circulation.

Imagine a small amount of deflation, absent external catastrophes.  If someone were to not invest or spend their money in order to benefit from its greater buying power next year, they would be giving up consumption and the gains from investing in companies whose growth outpaces deflation.

Those two forces oppose the gain from not spending / investing in proportion to how much money and hiw long, so I don't see the slippery slope effect you are claiming exists.";1;1;False;SilencingNarrative;dx0xxzj;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

How is that using it? Everyday I see a post on r/cryptocurrency on how only with coins that create real economys will survive or how asset backed coins will succeed. Everybody agrees, yet there is no economy with bitcoin. One day this is a gold value coin then it's a payment coin. Everybody can hold it but less than 100 or even 50k are actually using it. Why did growth stop at that number? Because bitcoin is terrible. None of the early contributors for btc actually believe this coin will have global adoption. Ever. Over the next few years btc will most likely pump hard and so will alts. But when btc goes down and it will. Coins with actual economys will replace it.;3;1;False;Supreme__IceCream;dwzjq70;Bitcoin?;8afz22;https://i.redd.it/fvts38t56fq01.jpg
"why would i accept a volatile coin that is un-private? It was already proven that the NSA can track your payments and identify each user. 

Synth the head of SKYcoin was one of the first contributors at BTC. He pointed out that the first devs and contributors think btc is basically a social experiment at this point. This coin is basically riding on a name at this point. Gmaxwell is holding BTC by strings just trying to keep it together. transaction times are long, LN reaching mass adaption is hysterical, miners control the mining pools. this is one of the most centralized coins in the entire market. Skycoin is an asset backed decentralized crypto currency that actually has a real economy behind it. Who cares if btc's network is ""strong""? its flawed and horrible. Look at ETH, 10 TPS, and each coin on their platform is on one blockchain. from a legal standpoint that will never work, companies need total control of their own blockchain token. 

BTC will rise, you will see more adoption in the world. but it will never work. BTC will eventually fall and be replaced by an actual coin that has real world need and use.
