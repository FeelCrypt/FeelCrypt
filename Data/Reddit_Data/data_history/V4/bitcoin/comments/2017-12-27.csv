After breaking the 12500 level, it wound up finding support again, before entering a consolidating triangle around 14 and after a longer pause than i thought was going to happen it just popped a bit to 15 and hit some resistance. there was some higher volume in the pop as well, which looks bullish. kind of looks like it'll rally back up again to $20+.

"Geez, this tweet is making its way everywhere. (Yup that's my tweet)

Couple of things that've come up that I'll try to answer:

I really don't get why people think I would have killed myself over this whole bitcoin thing. There's literally no amount of money that Bitcoin could go to that would justify that. There are worse things that can happen in your life than selling something too early and if something like this is the worst thing that ever happens to you in your life, consider yourself really lucky.

Money is just money, a means to an end. Does it sting that I could have had an insane amount of money? Sure. Does it keep me up at night? Not at all, mostly it just makes me feel a bit stupid for not understanding what I was seeing at the time to hold, even before HODL was a meme. Seriously, I looked it up and HODL's from a December 18, 2013 Bitcoin Talk Forums post.

Am I doing alright? Yeah, mostly because I have a decent job.

Do I hold crypto? Really small amounts of some low market cap coins with technology that I like. The bulk of what I had remaining from playing with crypto early on got sold recently to pay off my student loans and credit cards. Not the payday that others have gotten, but it's had a positive effect on my life, I'm sure my credit is going to improve once it all registers. Now I mostly keep up to date with crypto to see what's going on and if there are any new interesting coins with cool technology. But I'm not throwing much money at it, nor do I really intend to.

To be honest I didn't get into crypto to make some huge payday, I don't think many of us did that early. It was a new technology to play around with, something we'd never really seen before. So we dropped a hundred bucks on Mt.Gox and did some trading, trying to see how it all worked. Traded to paper wallets, sweeped them into online wallets, sent them to friends, bought pizzas, played SatoshiDice. I didn't recognize what it all meant until much, much later.

Do I remember what I spent it on? The $0.30 sell wasn't the last of my trades, I think I made like $1k once I did finally pull the bulk of my account out of Mt.Gox into my bank account, it probably went to rent or other random purchases. I was mostly happy I came out ahead.";3100;26;False;gregschoen;dru5sm3;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg
No one 'knew what bitcoin would become'.  No one could possibly know that, even if they *thought* it had a lot of potential.  5x ROI is good, I respect him for taking his profit and running.

The price of a good or service or asset increases until the quantity demanded equals the quantity sold.

But yes, there would be an equilibrium between fees and hashrate due to the impact on mining profitability. Still, if fees go so high that it causes a panic because even with massive fees, users can't actually get into blocks, then we'd have this nightmare scenario where eventually the whole thing just collapses and dies. Fortunately for them, most users keep their coins on exchanges, so they would be able to convert to fiat until either the exchanges went down or the value of BTC plummeted too far.

I think you’re right and yes Reddit is the best source for understanding and finding out about these markets. Like the US elections and so many other recent things, the viral nature of the internet has also stymied growth. We are seeing the same messaging failure in BTC / BCH that we saw in Occupy Wall Street. It was a great cause but in it’s quick growth and media coverage, the core message was lost, tangled, confused and distorted to the point where people forgot why they were there. They fell in love with the term “occupy Wall Street” like crypto is falling in love with “HODL”. Once the attention and fight is about the message and it’s meaning and not the underlying reason people gathered in the first place it becomes lost and broken. That seems to be what we are seeing. In my view. Maybe I’m wrong.;7;0;False;worthlessTbill;drtrx7p;Quote from Andres Antonopolous.;7mdck7;https://i.redd.it/t7ad4k2vre601.png

Well it's true, is the thing. They drove us insane with a war of attrition in Vietnam thanks to Eisenhower promising anti-communist support in 1955. Then we did basically the same thing in Afghanistan but to them. The fact is that we were simply better positioned to drive them into the dirt thanks to our post WW2 positions. The other big difference is that we weren't aggressive in Vietnam, not in terms of territory. And it cost a lot more to kill an American soldier in Vietnam than it did to kill five Russians in Afghanistan. But the Russians *just couldn't quit.* They required the image of power in conquest to hold down the republics... they failed in Afghanistan, ruined their image, lost all kinds of hardware to circa 1960s equipment.

"The way I’ve viewed scaling even before LN was a thing, was through a second layer. Kind of like a checking/savings or debit cards/checks. Where you take some security risks and gain some significant benefits for speed and low fees. 

If I’m moving large amounts of money, I don’t mind paying fees, if I’m buying things for under $100 I’ll take some risks to move that without fees quickly...bc well max I lose 100$. 

I don’t know wether LN is the solution or not, and I’m no bitcoin core shill, they have their own issues. But I do believe the LN could be the beginning of a solution. 

I don’t see constantly increasing blocksize as a feasible solution, til what end can you keep increasing blocks? Bitcoin cash is pro blocksize upgrades bc their miners are alibaba, who has computational powers to sustain that, but then you risk centralization. 

LN def has its problems too. I wouldve liked to see it implemented in Litecoin and widely used prior to bitcoin implementing it. 

As for opening and closing channels, yes it’s confusing but it’s also a brand new tech. If it’ll work I’m sure a GUI interface will be created down the line. Look back a few years, mining and even buying crypto was a fairly difficult task...now some projects have one-click miners.

"Socialism is about distributing the wealth of a nation (group of people) for social benefit. It's not *about* the ownership of means of production - or for that matter distribution - that's just a defining characteristic. Socialists would be just as happy with there being no ownership of such things and only stewardship.

A good example are the socialist systems we have in the USA. Road systems, the mail, the library, the police and fire departments. You know - the stuff that makes a society functional. Lots more stuff used to be completely socialist as well. Prisons, for example. A whole bunch more stuff the military did.

But if you look at those things you'll notice that the means of production and distribution of the things those entities use aren't owned by the people of the USA or the state. While the police, libraries and and roads departments can operate at a financial loss for the good of the people of the country, the firearm manufacturers, publishers, road repair companies and so on and so forth cannot. 

Things can be socialised to varying degrees and with very different effects on their society.

Nope, and neither is it now. In fact effective throughput has never been higher than it is today (not even before the 1MB cap).

Nope, they are (as opposed to the bulk of other companies in this space) doing an incredible amount to help development and have done so for years. I think anyone holding $15k BTC owes them gratitude.

"""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.""

TLDR: Jaynes believes that mankind was originally not conscious, in the sense that we did not make decisions for ourselves or introspect, and instead followed orders which were auditorily hallucinated by the right brain, which was subconsciously doing silent work without purposeful input by the individual. He argues that the forced interaction of migrating tribes caused people to need to generate metaphor and advanced linguistic constructs and practice empathy in order to peacefully interact, and this caused the plastic brain to adapt and form a conception of culture and self. Interesting tidbits from Jaynes: schizophrenia is a vestige of this previous mind-state; Ancient stories such as Homer's Oddysey do not demonstrate decision-making by the characters, but instead acting on orders from Gods or other authorities; as hallucinated voices faded from commonality, those who were still able to hear voices were placed in high esteem as being connected to the Gods, and consulted for guidance (oracles etc).

"> Has there ever been a time that it was necessary to pay $40 in order to have one's transaction included in the next block?

The average transaction fee over the past week has never dropped below $40. Some pay more, some pay less. You can pay less if you want to take the risk of your transaction sitting in the mempool for days or weeks, but that's not really a viable solution for most people.

Obviously people are still using Bitcoin, and it still has inertia from being the first mover. When Bitcoin was worth next to nothing, that didn't mean it was a failure long-term. Conversely, being worth $16K or whatever it is, doesn't mean it is viable long-term. Blockbuster was still the volume-leader in movie rentals long after it's business model was made obsolete.

Something has to change in a big way for Bitcoin to maintain the lead in market cap. It could happen; LN might actually work within 6 months, who knows?? If you have to beg centralized corporations to adopt it, then I don't think it will work, but anything is possible. Ripple is not far away from surpassing Bitcoin, and it is ready to scale immediately. Say what you want about it not being decentralized, or it's run by banks, or whatever. In 6 months you might sound like somebody extolling the virtues of the Microsoft Zune; hardcore users might think it's perfect but if nobody else does, it will die. It won't take much more than a couple months of $40+ transactions to bring adoption to a complete stop. Sure, people who have it will move it around, and a ton of transactions are from people who are sending it for free through GDAX or people who just don't know any better and are learning how the fees work. It's not from people spending it on things, though. And without that segment of the market, it will die.

The consensus you're talking about comes directly from something decentralized, from individuals making individual decisions that affect the whole.

"Good question! Have you ever stopped to consider how or why we've come to create a support system for the disabled? And I don't mean historically. What I mean is that on a purely logical level there are already enough people who care to support the disabled to pass laws that do so. So there is no reason to believe that changing the economic system would change the support systems for any particular group. 

Think of it this way. You pay your taxes which are partly used to support the disabled. Now you might say that you are paying against your will and that you wouldn't pay otherwise. But in either case there are still parts of your taxes that you would be more than willing to pay if they were not forced upon you (i.e. policing, the fire department, education) as they all act as a form of insurance that have positive externalities. If there are already enough people to vote in a law that protects certain groups then ought we not believe they will do the same in a Capitalist market? Capitalism is just democracy where you vote with your dollars.

We need money to survive because market prices are the only way to efficiently coordinate society to produce the things people value. Without money and prices, society is left with a bunch of bureaucrats guessing what people value and using brute force to guide production. This centralized solution, manifested in such political ideologies as socialism and communism, has proven disastrous time and time again in terms of both human liberty and well-being.

The outcome of socialism and communism are guaranteed in past, present, and future. So instead of being ""sad that we need money to even be able to survive"" you should thank your lucky stars that you witnessed the creation of, and can use, the best form of money, Bitcoin, which make life better for all of us.

"if there are enough people running LN nodes (which seems like they will be relatively cheap to run) with at least 3 or so channels then I think It won't be much of an issue as most transactions will be reachable if you just add more hops , increasing fees sure but do you really care if the fee is $0.001 or $0.005 personally I wouldn't care much as like you said opening a channel is the expensive part you could make hundreds of transactions with more hops and it would still be worth it imo.

Yea I think hubs will also exist but they aren't an issue as big as banks. Yea they will deal with a lot of transactions but they have no effective say over them. the protocol ensures that. We don't have to trust the hub, like we do for a bank.

Lastly sorry for the dash on you but it's just gets tiring seeing people here complain how btc doesn't work like visa.

Like any market or network that is mostly unregulated bitcoin is vulnerable to outside capital. Now one person may not have the capital to attack the network (with purchased hashpower) or market share (with purchased coins/capital for more.) Or at least not enough incentive to do so. But a relatively small and powerful group could pool resources to do so. Think about bitcoin's market cap vs the amount of capital controled by banks and governments and ultra wealthy people. Also think about how far ahead early adopters are of everyone else. Much like how unregulated markets tend toward monopoly or oligopoly, bitcoin will naturally centralize around those with the most capital. Those people's interests may not be the best interest of bitcoin/blockchain.;0;1;False;shanerm;drtpszj;Quote from Andres Antonopolous.;7mdck7;https://i.redd.it/t7ad4k2vre601.png

The problem wasnt that it was a hard fork, it was that it would have been a contentious hard fork. If they had executed a plan as you describe, there is no way of knowing if the market would have accepted it and that could have potentially been a worse problem. 

It was obvious that people felt, for whatever reason, that SW as a soft fork was the way to go. The market wasn't sure. It was actually the market that was co-opted into accepting SW2X, and that is where the blame should lay, in my opinion. 

If it hadn't of been accepted/signed, SW wouldn't have gone through, and alternative plans would have been put in place.

"No, it just seems that being able to manipulate the populous and those in power to bail you out is a desirable trait that nature has selected at the moment.

Evolution isn't a god that selects the traits that progress toward some ideal we can rationalize as the best outcome over the long term. Genes are not 'superior' or 'inferior' except in microcosms of existence-- specific situations that give one set of genes a predisposition to survive.

Evolution, that led to us, and the fundamental idea of capitalism is to throw eggs into as many baskets as possible and hope something makes it out of the other side after nature throws a random set of stressors at it. Communism is a practice of predicting the future and deciding which basket to throw your eggs in. You get the right basket and you'll have quite a few more eggs when the dust settles. No one has yet chosen the right basket. 

Like it or not, capitalism is more of a natural flow than communism. Doesn't mean one is better than the other or that one has a natural mandate to exist. There are just more fundamental barriers that existence has in place against communism.

In the end, life itself is a struggle *against* nature. Natural selection is just a mechanism that exists in the blip of unnatural low entropy that will succumb to the heat death of the universe unless life lucks out and finds a way to overcome that natural barrier.

sorry i have to disagree with andreas on this one. the drama is very real. does it matter in the long run? maybe not, but no one can read the future. there is a group of people actively trying to trick ppl into thinking their coin 'is the real bitcoin'. are we supposed to just sit back and let them say it ? also, most of the FUD is still coming outside the crypto community, and i think the community as a whole still does a good job of banding together to refute  hot takes from Wall st and the MSM. yes there are lots of debates happening within crypto and within bitcoin, but that's been the case with every new innovation or technology in the world. people who debate on reddit are not spies or paid shills, that's just a dumb and toxic thing to say ;1;1;False;jonnybornsteinho;drtgca0;Quote from Andres Antonopolous.;7mdck7;https://i.redd.it/t7ad4k2vre601.png

Bitcoin is not a community. It is only a technology. The ""community"" that forms around it is completely irrelevant, and to be honest probably detrimental.

That's pretty much 99% of this sub. Anyone who thinks this has any value at all is kidding themselves.

"I’ll probably get a ton of shit for this but I think it’s the group behind Ripple. I know I’ll come off like a conspiracy nut but here goes:  
Who wants to see bitcoin fail the most? The big banks and federal reserve. Why? Because they have had a monopoly on this system of wealth (fiat) and they do not want to loose power to a community like bitcoin. Recently they have artificially induced the market cap to go up by locking up over 1/2 the supply in an escrow account, creating a wave of fomo in the crypto sphere. Take a look at the Japanese exchange ‘mr ripple’ it is a mainly a ripple exchange where bitcoin is always trading for less than the average price (during this recent btc dip they were selling btc for less than 8k) I believe we will see further attacks fro ripple in 2018. They have ties to the government (Ben Lawsky), the federal reserve (Ben Bernenke) and large banks (chase and g&s) as well as tenuous ties to google. I know a lot of people reading that are think “awesome I’m going to make a lot of money with xrp, it’s basically a sure thing with all those big names behind it.” But I’m here to caution you, xrp is highly centralized, the tokens are 100% Premined and unequally distributed and there is no cap on the supply meaning they could potentially issue another 100 Billion ripple (that’s right there are over 100B ripple in existence and there will be way more than that if they want there system to flow as planned!)

"This is very true. Lotta us just talking about how much money we're going to make off of bitcoin. If we are in it for that, we shouldn't be in it at all.

This is extreme but it's based on the premise that bitcoin wasn't initially created for people to make massive returns, it was created as an alternative to centralized fiat currencies. 

Therefore, a focus on technology in the community will create a much stronger foundation of supporters rather than fickle buyers who are looking for a quick buck; they buy in and pull out at the drop of a hat.

"> There will be an election, there will be a spokesperson, there will be a centralized group of developers. 

There are. The systems you are talking about are BCash, Ethereum and many more. They have spokes persons, they have (benevolent) dictators and centralized development. They have giant marketing budgets and questionable tech.

Bitcoin is the diametral opposite of that and so far people are holding it in high regard exactly for that reason. That doesn't mean that people won't try to subvert it but due to the way the system is build, all they can achieve is to create another fork. Another shitcoin like thousands before.

As long as the market values bitcoin precisely for it's ungovernability, it's resilience to regulation, it's censorship resistance and decentralization, things probably won't change all that much!

This is why I think bitcoins price is an important property. It doesn't matter if it temporarily drops to 1000$ or even less. Long-term integrity of the system is more important than short term returns.

But when developers say, they don't care if it drops to 5$ I do get a bit worried.

That being said, people are poorly equipped to deal with novel information, and are lacking in critical thinking skills. They are not able to pass sound judgements, and are convinced but emotional group narratives more than reason.

Crypto is especially tough, because too many people are here for the money, and that's paramount. It's also hard, because there aren't many verifiable unbiased sources that dig into tech and philosophy. I view reading Reddit crypto subs as a part time job now, sifting through piles of bs to aggregate an understanding of public perception (the real driving force behind market trends).

I've more than ""minimally researched the technology""; and you're just wrong. Permit me to explain.

> They are, but there are solutions that can be implemented right now (segwit) 

If I make a transaction today on any of a number of other cryptos (including the one this sub seems to hate with a passion) it ""just works""; if I make a transaction on bitcoin today, even using SegWit, what I need to pay to get the txns through is tremendously large, and even it may or may not confirm for hours or weeks, depending on a variety of non-immediately-apparent factors.

> and that will be available in the not too distant future (lightning, sidechains etc.). 

In 2015, the main LN devs were claiming ""it would be ready not 6 months from then"". A few months ago it would be ""about a year and a half away"". That's not only ""not too distant future""; it's also not very clear it'll happen at all. Yes, I've used the eclair wallet and played around on the testnet before you ask; but these devs continue to refuse to publicly address the issue of the ruting algoritm; or put another way, how the LN is even supposed to be truly decentralized and trustlss. Go ahead, try and ask any of them yourself; and I assume you know what I'm talking about given that you claim to be well researched on the subject (and I do consider the matter of the ruting algrithm, the very thing that's supposed to ensure it's true trustlssness and corship-resistance a-là mainchain bitcoin, to be of ""minimum technical importance""). Rootstock's ""trustless reverse peg on the blockchain"" follows a similar story.

"The problem is that the community can't decide on solutions. The scaling debate has been going on for years. Most of the original Bitcoin core developers gave up on the project because they couldn't make progress.

Progress on the protocol is stalled and has been for a while. It's just not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol anymore because there will always be fundamentalists that argue it shouldn't be changed and that only soft forks will be allowed.

SegWit is a neat idea, but it's also an absurd hack. It's an accounting trick that doesn't actually offer real scalability, it simply allows more transactions in a block because only some of the bytes are counted. It doesn't save network bandwidth or blockchain storage space. Years ago, such a proposal would be seen as ridiculous and overly complicated. But now it's the only solution because just simply increasing the block size is sacrilege.

It was easy to get consensus in the early days because everyone working on the project believed in it. They did it in their spare time and it wasn't worth anything. Everyone had the same goal. But now there are tons of people involved, there's a shitload of money involved, and everyone not only has different goals but different ideas on how to reach those goals. Consensus for a protocol change will never happen again and Bitcoin will continue to be forked and forked until nobody really knows which fork has the best claim for being ""the real Bitcoin"". Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies will eat its lunch.

Of course, communism brings freedom, wealth and pure democracy.

We saw it in every single communist regime.

Regimes, todays communist usually call ""Not real communism""

In every generation is there a select group of idiots, who think this time, communism will work under their rule.

"They *are* an issue but whining about them instead of contributing to improving the situation is worthless noise. Bitcoin is an open source project, it's not a business that owes it's customers some level of sort service. 

Do you have any suggestions on how to solve this that are better than the current ""roadmap""? (for lack of a better term): Let SW adoption increase through incentive and education while Schnorr signatures, MAST and LN is developed, tested and deployed. If you think a hard fork is a realistic and good solution after the BCH and SW2X debacles, I'm not sure what to tell you.

Bitcoin will scale, but it is clear that a large group of users and developers does not want to compromise how it scales in order to avoid temporary high-fee period and bail out businesses and users that mainly are concerned about the viability of small transactions. Thus, hard forking a block size at this point would inevitably create another altcoin, likely less popular than the last one.

Saying fees are pricing out poor people and businesses and ruining the entire goal of Bitcoin is in my opinion incredibly short sighted. People have been spoiled by the early days and the low demand for block space has created unrealistic expectations for there to always be “almost free” transactions for anyone in the world on-chain. 

There is nothing wrong with preferring a less conservative scaling approach, but I think it makes sense that the original network with by far the most value stored in it, isn’t being developed reactionary to short term changes.

If you are genuinely curious about the scaling approach I think many Bitcoiners and Bitcoin Core contributors align with, listen to Marty Bent's recent podcast ""Tales from the Crypt #5: A conversation with John Newbery"" - I think that sums up the vision that many ""small blockers"" have.

Here is the link to the podcast: https://talesfromthecrypt.libsyn.com/tales-from-the-crypt-5-a-conversation-with-john-newbery

"I disagree.  Zero monetary inflation is the only way to properly express the time value of money, which is critically important to minimizing the over-expansion of the credit cycle, which in turn is critical to avoiding catastrophic credit collapses.  Deflation can be a confusing topic for people since it's both the symptom of a credit collapse, but also an important ingredient in preventing the inflation of the credit bubble in the first place.  It's also not nearly as big a departure from our current monetary system as people think - the real money in our current monetary system is sovereign debt (US debt in the US$ monetary system), and that debt pays a real return - in other words, it acts much the same as a deflationary store of value.  When we talk about the ""Dollar reserves"" of foreign CBs and other large institutions, you're talking mostly about US debt with yield (notes, treasuries, bonds).  You need that store of value function to anchor any monetary system really; otherwise it's not a competitive system.

Bitcoin can only ""hyper-deflate"" during the adoption phase.  If and when the adoption phase runs it's course, then deflation over the longer term will average around the rate of real economic growth of the underlying bitcoin-denominated economy.  If historical economic growth rates are an indicator, that would be something in the neighborhood of ~3.5% per year in real terms.

"If Only There was A cryptocoin that had already had a gameplan in place to try to solve this catch 22 problem of mass cryptocoin adoption, of getting people accustomed to paying with a cryptocoin that might be not be the same price in the next hour, by making it an everyday trivial event to pay with feeless micropayments. 

Perhaps this strategic accustomization could be accomplished by allowing people to queue up a self driving autonomous vehicle, from Mercedes Benz/Daimler Chrysler (with fancy Bosch and JINN chips), and seamlessly pay for the service with a feeless microtransaction, instead of calling a human driving Lyft or Uber. Of which are already heading towards the direction of self driving vehicles. The entire experience would embody the mantra of ""Don't Make Me Think"".

I live in Thailand and BTC exchange works quite well here but no one takes it so I have to send to my bank via coins.co.th. But they charge less $1 for conversion and generally their exchange rate is better than I'd get selling USA and withdrawing from an ATM (which is basically my other option or what I'd do if paid in USD). It's mostly online pmts like hosting strangely that are problems now and that's primarily because BitPay services them and cannot get their backend more efficient, or maybe has other reasons not to want that. I could really use a Bitcoin debit card but all the ones I've seen charge too much. I guess they don't have much choice if the banking networks fees to issue a card are high.

The thing is, services are pulling back from accepting Bitcoin, not moving towards it. Just this week, for example, Steam no longer accepts Bitcoin. Transaction costs, slow transactions, and a stupid amount of volatility means that actually selling anything in Bitcoin just doesn't make sense. There are fundamental problems with Bitcoin that make accepting it a bad business decision, and nothings going to change that in the near future. There might be a cryptocurrency that solves Bitcoin's problems and gets widespread acceptance some time in the future, but that cryptocurrency isn't going to be Bitcoin.;1;0;False;LiterallyBismarck;drt4hp6;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

>Sure the markets are great for media exposure, but wow did things change in the past few years. Money has converted this movement into a war. Greed has taken over. People are more concerned about their coin ""going to the moon"" than helping others.

You are looking back with rose colored glasses. Many people, myself included, got into crypto because we were tired of being bullied by nation states that restrict capital flow, that print endless paper dollars/yuan/whatever backed by nothing. The only reason crypto became necessary is because fiat is fundamentally broken, the federal reserve is broken, commercial banking is broken, remittance industry is broken. Your average person is fleeced by taxes and fees and inflation. We are treated like fucking cattle and our future is entirely uncertain. Few in my generation will retire at all.

I didn't get into this to play captain save-a-hobo. I don't care about you, your family, or your money problems. I care about MINE. Greed is good. Greed, and the desire to improve one's self, and one's lot in life, leads men to take risks.

"This is an inevitable consequence of people unquestioningly supporting deflationist monetary policy.

Even Austrian school economists like Hayek agreed that deflation was a bad thing. Their ideal was 0% inflation or deflation, that the supply of money would scale perfectly with demand, and so neither encourage hoarding or over-spending.

Even if you thought slight deflation was a positive thing, the level of deflation hard-coded into coins like bitcoin is ridiculous and guarantees speculative bubbles. The supply is completely unresponsive to demand. You can have a 10,000% increase in demand and supply will keep halving every 210,000 blocks no matter what.

"It once took me two weeks to download Southpark the movie @3kb/s through an IRC friend's FTP dump.  The UK didn't have residential broadband back then and I would have to wait a whole year before the movie was released in UK cinemas...  As such, 2 weeks constantly downloading over a 56k modem seemed like a small price to pay, given I was such a huge fan of the show.

At about the same time, Napster had changed the way we shared music.  Prior to that we either used FTP dumps or DCC file transfers via IRC.  It was clunky and cumbersome, but we did it anyhow because the payoff was worth the effort.

We could of course see that in good time, HD streaming and on demand music services like Spotify would be a reality, but that there would be many challenges to getting there, both technological and social...  

In the meantime, we did the best with what we had and enjoyed every minute of this new borderless cyberspace.  

Our conversations were about the beautiful adjacent possible of where this technology could go... This, of course, left very little time for complaining about things like download speeds ;)

It was a whole ten years on before those dreams crystallised in the form of Spotify and YouTube... When they arrived, did we stand still?  Nawww, the next adjacent possible unfolded, another set of dreams ten years away from reality.

TL;DR: We can get busy complaining about problems in the present, or we can get busy inventing (and championing) solutions capable of pulling us forward and overcoming those problems.  We can only do that by appreciating how far we have already come together and getting behind a unified future vision, just as we did at the beginning of all this before the current imperfections were even an issue.

"> Hoarding money does not generate any wealth. The ""frees up resources"" argument is a zero sum fallacy. Burning the money would also ""free up resources"" by this definition, but it is not generating any wealth, its simply redistributing wealth to other people with money.

The point being if people are investing their money, it's because they feel they can earn a better return than the risk free real rate.  You want to maximize the purchasing power of those people, and that's what everyone else hoarding their cash (rather than real resources) does.  Otherwise it by definition competes for real resources in the economy (raising the price level), and if they can't even produce a return as high as the natural rate, that's a *net negative* for the economy.  Those real resources were, on average, less productive than they would have otherwise been (the common misconception is that those real resources would otherwise go unused - not true, their price would simply be lower).  That's malinvestment and you don't want to incentivize it.

"Well, I can only talk from my experience of being here the first time around and having built and scaled internet sites from zero to millions of users over the last 15 years... Invariably that was best achieved with code optimisation and carefully planned load balancing as opposed to simply rolling out bigger, faster, stronger tech... 

I'm also very conscious of the many mistakes we all made along the way building those sites... chiefly because of having to pander to the interests of the big business crowd that know nothing about computer science.  

I'm tired of that - we don't let the janitors or the electricity company preside over the science teams working at the large hadron collider, so why should VCs and salesmen dictate over computer science decisions?

Of course, if you believe there's a better way, this is all designed in such a way you're welcome to try.  Just be wary of ramming 'your way' down others throats, especially when it's clear users will be the ultimate arbiters in all this.

If nothing else the 'my way is better than your way' debate is very boring... Most of us have moved on.

But gold has developed in different cultures a perceived value that differed widely. Think the Spanish and the Aztecs, Incas. Just like government issued treasury notes, a faith of mutually agreed upon perceived value of a token is required for it to be used as currency.

 And I agree with the OP that currency's real value is its ability to move freely and easily and represent a mutually agreed upon perceived value for purchase of commodities that have intrinsic value.  (Like something you can eat.)

Because the demand for bitcoin is outpacing supply. It doesn't matter whether the demand outpaces supply because supply drops or because demand increases. It's all deflation caused by not having sufficient supply of money to meet demand.

"**Monetary inflation**

Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area). Depending on many factors, especially public expectations, the fundamental state and development of the economy, and the transmission mechanism, it is likely to result in price inflation, which is usually just called ""inflation"", which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services.

There is general agreement among economists that there is a causal relationship between monetary inflation and price inflation. But there is neither a common view about the exact theoretical mechanisms and relationships, nor about how to accurately measure it.

">  I specified zero monetary inflation - in other words, a fixed quantity of base money (no increase to base money supply). When combined with a growing underlying economy, this would result in price deflation.

I'm not sure what made you think I was referring to something different.

Supply of money needs to scale with demand to avoid monetary inflation or deflation. If supply outpaces demand you get inflation, if demand outpaces supply you get deflation, regardless of whether its because demand rose or supply fell or vice versa.

If you have a fixed money supply you're guaranteeing deflation unless economic growth grinds to a halt. I thought it was already clear that our main disagreement was whether deflation was a good thing or not, not what causes it.

>I argue that the real rate of return of a fixed quantity base money (due to deflation) is the ""optimal"" rate of real risk free return. Any yield below that is not a productive use of real resources, as it would return below the natural rate of growth of the real economy. 

You're going to need to describe that in more detail. If you're referring to what I think you're referring to, this is a zero-sum fallacy, that somehow not spending money frees up resources. 

Most resources are not zero sum in the economy. Wealth is generated, not just redistributed. If you buy a ton of steel, the cost of production was factored into the price, which means the steel producer gets money to create more than a ton of steel.

In this way buying resources can increase the availability of resources, not decrease it.

The only resources this doesn't apply to are ones like real estate, radio-frequency space, etc, which need to be regulated as commons to avoid monopolistic rent-seeking.

Hoarding money does not generate any wealth. The ""frees up resources"" argument is a zero sum fallacy. Burning the money would also ""free up resources"" by this definition, but it is not generating any wealth, its simply redistributing wealth to other people with money. The act of hoarding money is simple rent-seeking on artificial scarcity of an economic utility. Other people need money for trade so they'll give you more for it if you artificially restrict the availability of money than if you don't, even if you yourself are not doing anything of value.

Thankfully there's no laws forcing people to use deflationary currency which is why deflationary currencies get abandoned, even when the supply isn't fixed (like gold coins).

"> Money being invested in wealth generating projects generates more wealth than money sitting under a mattress.

This is the exact misconception I was talking about, and no, I do not agree at all.  Money does not generate wealth, the efficient use of real resources does - the only question is how money can assist in the optimal allocation of real resources (again, money is just a coordination tool, and should not be confused with a real resource itself).  If money is hoarded, that *does not* mean that real resources go unused, it just means their price levels are lower.  Do you follow up to that point at least?  The real resources will get used, they just might get used by someone else, and at a lower price, and I'm arguing that the latter will lead to a more optimal allocation of resources compared to a system lacking a strong deflationary store of value, because lacking that you create incentives to invest in yields below the natural rate, which is a net drag on the economy.  It's not ""more spending = more growth"", it's ""optimal spending = optimal growth"", and I believe hoarding (i.e. saving) is a key facet in avoiding suboptimal spending; i.e. malinvestment.";1;1;False;saibog38;dru5wdv;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/
"Inflation only helps debtors if it's unexpected.  Otherwise it's priced into interest rates (look at interest rates during the high inflation of the 70's/80's).  Paying 8% in a 2% inflationary currency is roughly the same thing in real terms as paying 4% in a 2% deflationary currency.  So yeah, if your inflationary currency suddenly changes to a deflationary one, that causes problems for debtors.  That's not a counterargument against a deflationary-by-design monetary system though.  It's an argument for why we shouldn't try to make the Dollar deflationary, since it's a unit of account that has the expectation of being inflationary.

Also note, ""debtors/savers"" doesn't exactly correspond to ""poor/rich"" in the way we might usually assume.  There are people living with very modest means who have decent savings, and there are people in heavily mortgaged mcmansions making payments on a garage full of vehicles who may be net in debt.

"I wasn't actually commenting on the crypto aspect of the thread just the net neutrality statement.  Your probably right, at least from a mainstream level of adoption.  Even if all governments go anti-crypto we would still see various forms of it being used as an underground currency in the future.  I also like to point out that the world isn't all a single entity.  There is plenty of opportunity for one government to ban cryptos and another one fully embrace them.  

I'll be really interested to see how it all plays out.  The government's ability to control it's currency gives them a significant amount of power which I'm not sure is bad for us lowly civilians all of the time.  China and the USA have both managed to control their currency in a way that strongly benefits them.  Countries who don't have control over their currency *and* run a large debt seem to be having serious problems now (Greece, etc).  I guess the big question is, would a crypto based currency stop them from over spending and if it did would it be a positive or a negative for the citizens?  A currency that doesn't lose value or even climbs in value helps the savers and the better off, while government spending tends to help the poorest and those who don't or can't save or invest.  I guess the question is, can you play the debt game forever?  If so you could help the poorest and continue to grow the country.  If you can't, if it eventually gets ""called in"" and causes things to collapse then maybe it's better to remove control of currency from the government?

Anyway, I'm rambling.

"Number 2 is broken in bitcoin's current form.  Peer to peer transactions are not supposed to be relegated to the rich.  High fees are a form of access control.  High fees were never supposed to happen.  Fees were supposed to stay relatively constant (and near zero) while number of transactions grows.  

The ""fee market"" was designed to kick in about 100 years from now and it should **NOT** be focused on fee per transaction.  It is designed to maximize fees by increasing total number of transactions all at low fees.  Every single transaction should be cheap enough that the poorest people in the world can still access the main chain with a fee that is small enough that they can afford. 

Lightening adds a second layer which I am perfectly fine with, but it does not solve this issue.  The things that solve number 2 are either larger block size or higher efficiency per block.

"Using bitcoin the way you do only ever trades bitcoin for dollars and back again. Bitcoin is never being traded for a good or service, its always being traded for a medium of exchange first. That makes it an asset being traded with currency, not something used as currency.

The fact you're using a service which sells it for dollars for you really quickly on your behalf does not mean its ever getting used for anything other than being bought and sold for dollars. It does not matter how fast you can sell something for money or if someone else does it for you, it does not make it a medium of exchange because its only ever being bought and sold for money, its not being used as money. the medium of exchange is what you're using as money.

a medium of exchange can be directly traded for any good or service in the economy. you can buy a massage with dollars, sell a hotdog for dollars, rent a car with dollars.

You cannot buy a massage with 20 hotdogs. you cannot rent a car with a massage. It doesn't matter if you can instantly sell 20 hot dogs, or get someone else to instantly sell them and get the money to buy a massage, it does not make hot dogs money. the fact you have to sell it first proves it can't be used as money in that context, otherwise you could just spend it without selling it.

the ease or speed at which you can sell something for money doesn't make it money. the liqudity of an asset doesn't make it money. whether it is being used as a medium of exchange is what makes it money.

">i didnt sell bitcoin for dollars and then use the dollars to buy something, thats two steps. i did it in one step

If you give your friend a watch to go to sell and buy you a pack of cigarettes with the money, that is also one step. It doesn't mean you bought cigarettes with a watch. 

Two completely separate exchanges are happening, a watch for money then money for cigarettes, you're just getting someone else to do it for you. It doesn't make it 1 exchange just because you're getting someone else to do it. It doesn't matter how fast they do it, its still using something else as a medium of exchange.

Money is defined as a medium of exchange, not just something you can get someone to sell for money that you can then use to buy something with. That definition is meaningless, it applies to anything you can sell. If you exchange an apple for money, and then you use that money to buy an orange, it doesn't make apples a medium of exchange. No one would accept an apple as money just because you can sell apples for money and then use the money to buy something else.

Even if you trade the apple directly for something, bartering is not the same thing as currency.

The number of steps doesn't matter. What matters is what people are actually using as a medium of exchange.

"I should have been clearer to say that its hard-coded to deflate for the level of demand we're seeing.

Bitcoin could have inflation if demand wasn't growing, because the number of bitcoins is still growing, but demand isn't going to grind to a halt as long as people continue to use it. The only way for bitcoin to avoid deflation is for the adoption rate to start decreasing which is obviously not a great thing for a currency you want people to adopt.

Almost every other currency in human history has had some mechanism to adjust supply to demand.

When we had shell currencies, people would gather more shells if they were more in demand, less if demand went down. We'd mine more gold when the price of gold went up and less when it went down.

Gold became too deflationary to use as currency just because supply couldn't increase fast enough, not that it was actively decreasing. Gold supply has been increasing for the last 100 years, but its just not fast enough to meet demand, so no one wants to use gold coins as currency when they keep getting more valuable.";1;0;False;suninabox;drtiqdi;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

I was trying to distinguish from the keynsian definition of inflation which counts all price changes rather than just the ones that are a result of monetary inflation/deflation. You can still have price rises in an economy due to underlying factors of supply and demand even when money supply is meeting demand, so its important to distinguish between price rises as a result of underlying factors of production and price rises as a result of increasing the supply of money.

"The fluctuating price and initial fiat capital. Let's be real, BTC won't pay my bills any time soon. I need to convert it into fiat to live and when I get paid on Thursday at 2pm and the price sinks 5-10% on a normal day I have to wait or accept a pay cut. I have to work around traditional banking infrastructure to get my cash out, which makes timing... awkward.

This is mostly solved by having a solid amount of savings in fiat to start the whole process with. I didn't but now I do. This gives you freedom to choose when to convert BTC to fiat. Fun side note, I lived in Iceland and worked for a company that paid out EUR instead of the local ISK. The bank would convert by button press as well. The government did tax any gains from profiting off this exchange (as any country does) but they also correct for losses which was nice. This gave me exposure to this type of thing beforehand.

I don't really like dispensing speculative investment opinion to people I don't know. At the moment I hold BTC and ETH. Whether you see crypto as a store of value or a currency for the exchange of goods, you are still investing in one or the other. BTC is on a bit of shaky ground at the moment. The highly speculative price coupled with the drama related to BCH is hurting crypto as a whole short term. The sooner Lightning is enabled, proves its own claims, and the block size for BTC is increased (has to happen with Lightning anyway) the sooner we can move past this whole debacle and get to the real work. I'm taking a wait and see approach while holding a majority of my worth in crypto.

They wanted to charge me $20 barely 15 minutes after I sent a tx for $3 fee that confirmed in first block. So how is adding a 6x miner fee not controlling the fees? Are they really saying they need to send 6x as many txs internally that needs to be paid for in addition to my already paying for the miner fee. If they add BCH I will stand even more angrily against their practices as they have had LTC available for years and never worked on integrating that. Supporting BCH is directly the influence of BitMain and their desire to keep segwit from working (due to it preventing asicboost). They could work on improving their tx processing efficiency so they don't need to charge 6x the miner fee on every tx. IMO they're in a downward spiral now and adding BCH will just hasten it as they get boycotted by their own customer base. And the only reason BCH fees are pennies is because no one uses it. If it got more use you'd see the same shenanigans with it under stress but far worse because it would be controlled entirely by the main bad actor in Bitcoin today = BitMain and their cohorts.;2;1;False;jcoinner;drsmz35;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

"> inflation is a tax on savers - but who are the savers but the rich. Deflation is a tax on borrowers - but who are the borrowers but the poor.

I don't consider that a useful model.  That'd be true if the only way people ""saved"" was stuffing cash under a mattress, but no one does that.  In reality the wealthy have the best wealth management money can buy, and the whole point of that management is to park their wealth in yield-bearing assets - they're not just sitting thre eating the losses due to inflation.  Look at the massive asset price inflation of the last decade (that's where the effect of QE goes first) - if you're a rich person holding all your wealth in a bag of cash then it's been bad, but if you're holding equities/real estate instead then you're doing great.

It's actually the poor/middle class that are much more likely to have a significant portion of their savings (even if their net savings may be low) in cash or low interest accounts.  They don't have professional wealth management maximizing yield for them.  If you have the latter, inflation doesn't matter so much.  

If you think our monetary system is designed to serve the poor, I think you've been misled.  There's a lot of rhetoric that points that way but I've found it's almost universally untrue.  It's a system designed by and for the bankers, including the inflationary policies of the FED.

"First off, thanks for the polite and thoughtful reply addressing the concepts involved, it makes a refreshing change to being called a paid shill and being told to read Satoshis whitepaper. You raise some interesting points.

> Zero monetary inflation is the only way to properly express the time value of money

Zero inflation doesn't mean you need to have deflation. 0% inflation is also 0% deflation. Deflation distorts the value of money as much as inflation does, just in the opposite direction. 

I don't understand people who are bothered by inflation transferring wealth away from holders of money, but don't seem to mind that deflation is just reversing the direction of transfer. 

It seems people don't mind zero-sum transfers of wealth via the money supply, they're just bothered that they're not benefiting from it, and people can't print their own money but they can hoard a deflationary currency.

>If historical economic growth rates are an indicator, that would be something in the neighborhood of ~3.5% per year in real terms.

This is broadly true except:

1. Bitcoins are lost over time and there's no recovery mechanism, so its rate of economic growth + rate of lost coins. More coins will be being lost than made before we ever hit 21,000,000. If the rate of loss remains steady then it will accelerate over time as a relative percentage of coin loss (i.e. if 100 coins are lost a day, thats 0.01% of 1,000,000 but 1% of 10,000). It's also likely that the more people start using bitcoins the higher the rate of coin loss will become. 

2. Economies are still highly localized. USD are deflationary in Zimbabwe, but inflationary in the US, because the supply and demand of dollars is not uniform across economies. It's impossible to have a global supply rate for a currency that is optimum for every economy in the world unless the demand and supply in every economy is exactly the same. This is very unlikely to happen in our lifetimes. 

This would cause huge problems for economies if they tried to rely on something like Bitcoin. If 3.5% deflation is the perfect rate for one country then its either too much or not enough for countries with higher and lower demands for currency. National central banks are useful because they allow you to adjust the money supply to the national economy. If a country is going through a huge economic crash it has much different demand than one that is seeing 7% growth a year.

>Bitcoin can only ""hyper-deflate"" during the adoption phase

I don't know how it can leave the adoption phase when it would require decades of hyper-deflation at its current rate of adoption before it ever got there. Less than 1% of the earths population is using bitcoin. The demand for bitcoin will have to double many times before it sees even 50% adoption rate, by which time the supply rate will have halved several times.

you can't have an exponential increase in demand at the same time as an exponential decrease in supply without ever worsening hyper-deflation. It would take more wealth than all the wealth on earth to continue to fuel the current rates of demand for much longer. If any country was actually relying on bitcoin as a currency, 1000% deflation would have already collapsed its economy, and 1000% deflation is nothing compared to what would happen if demand keeps doubling and supply keeps halving. 

There's this hope that bitcoin will somehow get more stable as it gets bigger but it will only push deflation to more unsustainable levels. Next time supply rate halves is going to be brutal.";1;1;False;suninabox;dru0ofp;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

"> Zero inflation doesn't mean you need to have deflation. 0% inflation is also 0% deflation.

So an important clarification to make here - I specified zero [*monetary* inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) - in other words, a fixed quantity of base money (no increase to base money supply).  When combined with a growing underlying economy, this would result in price deflation.

In macroeconomics, there's basically an open question over how central banks should target interest rates.  There are all sorts of theories how the natural rate of interest should be set (or if it should be set at all).  

I argue that the real rate of return of a fixed quantity base money (due to deflation) is the ""optimal"" rate of real risk free return.  Any yield below that *is not a net productive use of real resources*, as it would return *below* the natural rate of growth of the real economy.  It's better that some capital sit in virtual cash rather than compete for real resources that they will utilize suboptimally (hoarding cash results in cheaper real resources for those who will make better use of them).  A strong monetary store of value reduces the demand for real resources (real estate for example) as a store of value, which improves overall economic efficiency.  You want people buying a piece of real estate because they will make good use of it, not because they just need someplace to park some wealth.

The purpose of money ultimately is a coordination tool to help us allocate real resources, and in order for it to properly do that across the time dimension, it needs a fixed *supply* (not a fixed price level).  

And losses of bitcoin also contribute to the overall ""cost"" of owning bitcoin (if you want to eliminate the potential for loss you could insure, but that just realizes the cost) which offsets the deflationary ""benefit"" it has.  

As for your points about hyper-deflation, I basically agree bitcoin won't be very stable until it's well into the 7 figures.  But I'm confident it can be very stable if it's widely adopted enough (the rate of deflation will swing some with the business cycle in the way real interest rates do now).  

So yeah, I think speculation needs to take bitcoin well into 7 figures territory (inflation adjusted USD) for it to stabilize enough to be a useful unit of account.

I think that's great! Never stop the hustle. I understand that. Personally I enjoy the quest for money more than I actually enjoy obtaining it. It always makes me feel that I have a purpose. It sounds silly but everytime I pay my mortgage I think, that's one more month we can live in our house. Nothing makes me feel better than knowing I did it myself. I made my way in this world  by starting out with very little. I can't tell you how many nights I went to bed tired but couldn't sleep because I was so hungry. I don't want to live that way again and I know I don't have to because I have the power to change that. It's easy to look at someone like you or I and call us greedy. Say all we care about is price, etc..  It's not what it's about, not to me. It's about freedom and THAT is what I see in cryptocurrencies. Also why I love BTC vs BCH.

This is certainly a concise commentary on the meaning of bitcoin. 

Engineers in my experience are unusually rational and fair-minded, they like stability and even distribution. Traders and finance people far less so, they seem to prefer volatility and winner-takes-all scenarios. 

So, if the project is to fulfill any kind of egalitarian objectives, we need to keep the money people from overtaking it (51% attack lol) completely. They def. have a role to play in popularizing and marketing the currency but should be kept out of determining $BTC’s fundamental direction if possible. 

(IMHO This is why proof-of-stake currencies are doomed to rapid takeover by elites/cartels/cabals followed quickly by irrelevance.)

For that to happen, the existing financial institutions would have to buy in, eventually seizing control and direction.

"I think, and please don't blast me too hard for saying it, that the price matters far more in the case of Bitcoin than in other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin in most investor's estimation is primarily a store-of-value coin. There are other coins which are designed to perform more complex and multifaceted functions through blockchain tech, so when those coins lose some of their value the inherent quality of the coin hasn't appreciably diminished in most people's minds. 

In Bitcoin's case, since it's source of relevance lies primarily in it's massive market cap, when that starts to dwindle people begin to jump ship fairly rapidly. Not hating on Bitcoin, it made crypto what it is today, but basically any cryptocurrency can act as a store of value in it's stead. On the other hand, if a coin like XRP/IOTA/ETH loses a significant fraction of it's value/market cap, people can justify retaining the coin in their wallets because it has a definite use case outside of how much it is worth. Many just aren't willing to wait the several months (at least) that it will take to complete lightning network and/or implement segwit on the relevant exchanges. As speculative investors they'd rather just jump to one of 100 coins that have more upward mobility and (current) functionality than Bitcoin. 

It's a fast-moving market and many aren't that sentimental about keeping BTC on top. It's much easier to hodl a coin like ETH that isn't constantly under attack from it's pygmy younger brother, additionally. Again, not hating, just giving my own perspective on the relevance of the price. I'm sure LN will be revolutionary, it's just a long, long way away at this point and we all know how crypto time works.

"Nah man.  You're right.  That *is* what this is all about.  That's why, even though I think there are some... questionable things about the Bitcoin Cash guys, I think ultimately it's easy to fall into the trap of ascribing malicious intent upon a competitor, when really there just *is* a difference of technical opinion.

I think they're playing a little fast and loose with blocksizes, but then, you know?  Maybe a hundred years from now, we'll be talking about the complaints of 8MB blocksizes like they were ridiculous.  And we'll be talking about blockchains *without* sidechain solutions as antiquated and not as useful.

So I can't join in on the hate train.  At the end of the day, they're people who hold crypto.  And they're dedicated to their ideal, and shit, *their* dedication has made me an extra $10,000.  I could cash out *one* B.C.H. and recoup my whole investment into cryptocurrency, and part of that is unambiguously because they *are* dedicated to making their currency good and making it work well.  I would even argue, they have a point, and the recent spate of social media encouraging people to get on the SegWit train (**raises hand meekly**) is a *very* healthy thing to see.

Blockchain currency is weird, man.  You have to campaign for your ideals, so even though ""we activated SegWit"" was in and of itself a major milestone, we STILL have to actually start USING that newly activated feature, we DO have to push for that.

"A Cypherpunk's Manifesto

                        by Eric Hughes

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively
reveal oneself to the world.  

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
their interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of
this; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,
but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many
parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the
others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
parties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such
group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
for that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we
must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases
personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a
store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. 
When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,
my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying
or what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to
get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my
identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,
I have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must
_always_ reveal myself.

Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An
anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An
anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say
something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If 
the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
privacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to
encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
privacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when
the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to
their advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will
speak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the
realities of information. Information does not just want to be free,
it longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available
storage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;
Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and
understands less than Rumor.

We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must
come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
to take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for
centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
handshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow
for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.

We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We
are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
money.

Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software
to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that
a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
fundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. 

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
good.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
fellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
privacy.  Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.

"Seeing all these complex replies, I can simply state that: 
As a currency, its value/price is what it is.

The technology behind it is a different story, and the monetary category that crypto falls under is the driving factor of its story.
So, in essence, as a currency, the exchange value of a cryptocurrency is what allows its adoption and realization of value. There are also ""platforms,"" such as Ethereum, which serve a double purpose.
I do see the point, however, that we should marvel at the invention of the blockchain technology itself, but such realizations only come through after extensive research and proper understanding of functions, codes, utility, n shit like that.

"I perfectly agree with you and wish you.

However, let us remember one of the first principles of Economics: People have unlimited demands. In other words, if we're to read this from a psychological perspective, we know that people (us in this case) are greedy and would always strive to accumulate profit in a timely manner. Thus, if there's a mean that would fluster and speed up this process, people will embrace it. Such as gambling, cryptocurrencies hold a great risk. However, they're also a short cut to becoming rich - something which most people are striving for. Thus, if it is the value of the currency that generates return on income, then this is the factor that people would focus on. 
Unfortunately, it is not our fault - this is who we are - imperfect creatures, a vessel of angels and demons. It is in our nature to act like stockholders. Analogously, we cannot blame the wolf for killing other animals - a predator does what it needs to survive...

"It’s price is a measure of its valuation, which is indicative of how many transactions it can really be used for. It’s not that we only care about going to the moon, it’s that when we hit the moon, the 1M mark, that means that bitcoin has achieved the equivalent market value of the United States, which means that its usefulness for small transactions is becoming increasingly significant.

Yes, some speculators want to get rich by investing in crypto, but everyone should want the price to go up.

"This is a legitimate issue.

On one hand, I have a small amount in bitcoin, and I was hoping that cryptos in general would be a place I could start using to build up an alternative savings account.

But there are so many edges to the Bitcoin Sword at the moment.

1.  The price swing up, then down, both carry a message:  this is not a consistent store of value right now.  A unit of exchange shouldn't be spiking, let alone crashing.  

2.  With the price swinging up, lots of people who wouldn't be interested become interested.  That creates large numbers of *unexpected* transactions.  

3.  As a result, the *transactions fees* of Bitcoin have been the main thing that is 'to the moon'.  My intent to put $100 - $500 per month in Bitcoin has been put off indefinitely:  I will be buying silver or gold coins for the moment.  I can afford a 5% commission on a 1/10th of an ounce of gold, that's under $10.  $30 fees for the same Bitcoin purchase, well, not right now.

4.  This has all left me with the feeling that this is a 'not ready for prime time' application.  We can't tell whether this is a modern application, or the story is going to end more like AOL, which was an amazing product that changed the world for hundreds of millions, but will only be known as a trailblazer and a 'beta test' rather than a final, lasting product.";1;0;False;CatOfGrey;drstckr;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

We had to make peace with the fact that the government may or may not use half the money from every account overnight to bail the banks (and the country) out. And every morning we had to make sure our life savings where still in place. Also we couldn't withdraw them cause the capital controls for over a year only allowed withdraws up to 60€/week per account. 60€/WEEK. Be my guest, try to survive  with 60 euros for a week and pay everything with that. Rent, food, gas, everyday expenses etc . On the other hand if you were smart enough (I wasn't) to ""store"" your money in btc you could probably profit on top of having peace of mind. Still think that store of value is bad? Step outside your bubble and see the whole picture. Some of us don't care if we can buy coffee or games over steam. Some of us just want to be the Masters of our hard earned money. Sure that was not the point of btc in the begining. But still, even now, with all it flaws, it's still really useful for some ppl.

"Only speculators focus overridingly on price because they plan to cash out.

For various project communities I am involved with I care about their success and that’s how it should absolutely be with Bitcoin. 

The challenge for 2018 for this community is pushing through the required changes to sort out the transaction volume, scaling and (currently ridiculous) fee issues.

That is what is making BTC only a store of value as its big proposition right now instead of an effective digital currency.  That is why price is the primary focus here - you care about how much your bar of gold is worth because that’s all it’s there for. If Bitcoin was being used more transactionally we would be continually buying and selling in it so spending and reacquiring.

At present the velocity of money in BTC terms is awful with mentality that somebody who paid 20 BTC for something 4yrs ago made a huge mistake.  No, if you kept all your money in BTC and thus every bit of fiat were transferring back to reacquire more BTC then spending it on things too is right and what Satoshi designed it for.

Hodling is a mentality for a store of value proposition only, not a usable currency.  This community needs to decide whether it wants to be a currency too, because if not others are stepping up to supersede it for that function rightly.

">It’s a volatile stock. Nothing more. It’s how it’s being used and I s the only reason it’s moving in price - hype. NOT belief in its purpose as a currency.

This should be obvious to everyone when the price has skyrocketed when its functionality has significantly decreased.

If the value was based on its utility then its price shouldn't have been decreasing as its fees and times increased, big merchants started dropping bitcoin related payment processors and its market share decreased.

Course people say ""but its useful as a store of value, its not meant to be a currency yet"", but they're only using the term ""store of value"" to mean ""something you can profit off speculating on"". In terms of a ""store of value"" that can be depended on to keep its value its terrible. It's price is highly unpredictable, if you bought a couple of weeks ago you just lost a significant % of your value, and it could be years before it ever recovers, if it does ever recover.

"**Hashcash**

Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks, and more recently has become known for its use in bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm. The original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"". Later a similar proposal called Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.

Honestly though, what do you expect.

Affordable housing was designed to provide comfortable living to the masses. In actuality, a bunch of already rich people bought them and inflated the rent to make more profit, while using the asset to increase their portfolio size. 

Tax reliefs designed to help poorer people save money have been exploited by the rich for profit and minimal tax payment. 

Wherever there is an opportunity to make money, people will do it. The saving grace of Bitcoin is the fact it is still somewhat complicated to the lay person and therefore we've only seen a small influx of people.

"I didn't realize that we were in a sports league and BTC was one of the teams. What's our mascot? 

Fact of the matter is, BTC in its current form is a spectacular currency failure. Nobody treats it as a unit of exchange, everybody treats it like a trading commodity instead. Fewer major places accept BTC as a method of payment now than they did in the recent past, and the ridiculous volatility in value at present means that there's little to no chance of anyone viewing BTC as anything but a commodity because the 0.05 BTC I have today might be worth half as much tomorrow as it is right now. Combine that with the fact that BTC is fundamentally structured as a deflationary currency that encourages holding, and you have a recipe for the current situation, where the only thing people are interested in is its nominal trading value.

Larger investors putting large sums of money into it will drive prices for a while until that is resolved, and possibly after.

"what is the relationship between cryptocurrency values and blockchain?  (outside the usage for its intended purpose as an anonymous currency, for which mostly it is a poor usage for due to the significant volitility in price).  

As I see it, blockchain is a technology that enables crypto. blockchain is where the value is at. crypto is an implementation of blockchain - and there is no link between the value of blockchain and the value of any particular cryptocurrency.  anyone can reproduce a blockchain, and rather than use a coin / token to incentivise people to maintain the network, it could be a requirement to participate in the network (ie: for large scale data storage solutions).

This is a fair stance. Though there's only so much you can discuss on the technical side, there's plenty of speculation to be done BEYOND price, such as how this will impact socioeconomics, psychology (going from not rich to rich very quickly), marketing, a new industry being born...etc. I wouldn't mind seeing more discussions on these other speculative topics rather than purely the price.

I got in about two months ago. I always thought Bitcoin was really cool and great and had a ton of promise. Then I bought in... and cared a ton more about the price, for obvious reasons. And caring about the price made me care more about the value and learn much more about it.

Caring about the price is *good.* Self interest is possibly the world's best motivator. Unfortunately most people are not altruistic. But don't confuse price with value, though the price should hypothetically reflect the value - it's really just a valu*ation*. Remember - Donald Trump is ""worth"" a billion dollars or more.

"It's an inevitable result of hard-coded deflation.

It's completely rational not to spend bitcoin if you believe it will be worth significantly more 6 months from now, especially when there are plenty of alternatives you can use to buy things in the meantime.

If demand outpaces supply then price will increase. If supply outpaces demand then price will decrease. 

The soon as you set a limit on supply, then any demand creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for speculators. Demand goes up when anyone buys, but supply can't respond, so price goes up, so people who are buying because the price goes up goes up even more.

Supply of currency needs to scale with demand for currency to avoid creating perverse incentives (like the perverse incentives to squat on domains and block their use rather than actually use them to do something productive).

For a currency to avoid hyper-deflation or hyper-inflation it needs to have some mechanism to adjust the supply of money relative to demand.

Coins like bitcoin just arbitrarily decrease supply over time, no matter how much demand for bitcoin increases. Even if demand for bitcoin goes up 10,000% the supply rate will stay the same. This means that pretty soon nearly all the demand is coming from speculators, because its too deflationary for use as currency, which makes the underlying demand very volatile.";1;0;False;suninabox;drtgtb5;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

"The difference is that pets.com has central management, debts, creditors, and releases a 10-K balance sheet of earnings every year. 

Pets.com has a definitive “wake up call”, a moment when you see the revenues aren’t there, a moment when you realize the CEO has no clue what direction they’re going, a moment when poor decisions and bad marketing can flop the entire gig. 

Pets.com can be massively in debt. Pets.com can file for bankruptcy and never get a second chance. 

Bitcoin does not have that.  Sure, there are leaders and big players.  But if they fall, others can take their place.  There is no centrally audited statement of revenue. 

Bitcoin always has a huge potential.  It will persist through a massive crash, and eventually slowly creep up. Because people will realize that the tech behind it is still promising.  

Bitcoin cannot file for bankruptcy.  Bitcoin does not carry debt.  Bitcoin will always keep on chugging along functioning happily on its own tech, totally independent of whatever its USD exchange rate is.

"> * What's slowing people down from adopting Segwit? Is it a time consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else? 

It needs to be done right and securely. But many services did it already, so it's not too big of a barrier.  
Most exchanges let the user pay the fee, so they don't care much... and to be fair, they have a ton of work to do with the user explosion anyways.

* Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to? 

Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on other factors.   
At the end, I don't expect the mempool to ever be empty. If transactions are cheap, their use will go up again.

* What determines fees, to begin with?

It's per byte of information. And then it's just a market mechanism: miners will prefer higher fee transactions if the blocks are full.  
Intentional spam can be a factor here.

* Are non-Segwit addresses still able to be created, or are all addresses moving forward going to be Segwit?

Addresses don't move. Coins move. So far the wallets also support generating of the old format also... I suppose at some point that will phase out.

"So, with the way Electrum sets up SegWit wallets, most mining pools and exchanges **don't yet recognize** those addresses. This is because Electrum uses ""full-SegWit"" bech32 implementation.   

To work around this, you can create the more ""backwards-compatible"" BIP49 implementation of a SegWit wallet via Ian Coleman's website then import into Electrum.

Here's a step-by-step.

**Note: Please take all available security precautions when generating your seed--VPN, https, firewalls, etc.**

---

1. [Go to this site](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) 

2. Click ""BIP49 derivation path"" and generate. Those fifteen words are your wallet seed.

3. In Electrum, File-->New/Restore-->Standard wallet and click ""Next""

4. Select ""I already have a seed"" and click ""Next""

5. Click ""Options"" box and check ""BIP39"" Seed then click OK

6. input fifteen words from Ian Coleman's site and click ""Next""

7. On the ""Derivation"" screen, replace **m/44'/0'/0'** with **m/49'/0'/0'** and click ""Next""

8. If you want wallet key encryption (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) enter a strong password and store it somewhere safe, then click ""Next""

9. Look at your wallet's addresses: they should all begin with ""3"" (if they don't, start over with a new seed).

10. Enjoy your new SegWit backwards-compatible P2SH-P2PKH wallet.

">Can i receive bitcoin from traditional address to segwit address?

Yes, you can. However...
> I wanted to use electrum segwit on desktop but it shows that i might not be able to receive from certain addresses that dont supprt bech32

That's because of the bech32 addresses which as of right now, nearly no one adopted them yet. So if you want to send from traditional address to bech32 address, the bech32 address will most likely be shown as invalid address. Many wallets/exchanges just don't recognize them yet.

If you're only allowed one wallet, then you'll have to find some way of creating the new SegWit wallet and then sending from your old wallet... maybe something very complicated and messy like:

- Make sure you have backup seed of old wallet
- Create new SegWit wallet with new seed
- Get new SegWit address from new SegWit wallet
- Restore old wallet with old seed
- Send all coins from old wallet to new SegWit Address
- Restore new SegWit wallet with new seed

"> bad actor's mining hardware

That's called a contentious fork, and because of the way difficulty works, it's incredibly difficult and expensive to do.  You can easily verify that a block is mined at ""real"" difficulty, and you'd need to basically burn money if you aren't mining bitcoin with the same consensus rules as the majority.  

The theoretical vector for this attack is to secretly hide 51% of the hashpower and mine a longer chain, say 7 or more blocks, to double spend even ""successful/verified"" transactions. However, at this point, given how many miners there are, that would cost at least several billions of dollars (depending on what assumptions you make about how you get the hardware and the electricity).";1;1;False;davvblack;drsyi1t;Day 4: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like SegWit & order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"> Has anyone heard of coinbase moving to SegWit?   

""we are planning to implement SegWit in 2018.""

> Anyone have a bit of advice here?

You have 2 options:  
1) If you really want to hold for some years, let it stay on Coinbase in order to save transaction fees. **But** the general advice is to never let your BTC in an exchange because you don't have control over your private keys. If the exchange is down, you don't have access to BTC. If the exchange gets hacked, there is a high chance that your BTC will most likely be gone.
2) You transfer your BTC to a wallet (with Segwit support if possible) where you have control over the private key, but you need to pay the transaction fee once.  

If you have much much money in BTC and want higher security, go for option 2.

"I have a question, but I believe the answer (and the question) might help enlighten users to move to Segwit.

Sorry if this has been answered before... but I couldn’t find the answer, all was about possibility of sending from Segwit to non Segwit address, or the transaction fees or speed of both.

My question is, I just installed bitWallet, which I assume supports both Segwit and non Segwit. I have my BTC in Bread which is a non Segwit, so all my addresses start with “1”, non Segwit.

If I created a new Segwit wallet in bitWallet, and restored with my 12 word seed phrase (from Bread wallet), would it go in the new wallet as a Segwit or non Segwit address, in both cases when I send BTC from the new bitWallet to any other BTC address whether Segwit or non Segwit, would I benefit from the speed and cost of Segwit?

I hope I made my question clear, and hope to get an answer.
