"Trump ruined his reputation by running for president so idk what you mean by he's trying to push his brand, which everyone already knew about... 

Americans who went to canada for cheaper pharmaceuticals did so legally and paid for what they came for, and then left back to the country they came from.

They don't take jobs, i never said they did buddy, I literally said some are coming just to take advantage of our social programs. I think it's terrible business owners have the ability to take advantage of all these illegal aliens, by paying them lower than minimum wage, but we keep letting them come in undocumented which only perpetuates the problem.

We have almost a 1 million people long legal immigration wait list because the illegal immigrants keep butting in front of everyone else trying to do it the right way.

You think I'm a racist or xenophobe but I'm actually just being realistic. We need to solve the illegal immigration problem before we can work on quality legal immigration.

If people could keep all that they earned, working and being successful would be incentivized instead of punished.  In addition, the heavy handed regime that we have now, which requires everyone to meticulously track every tiny detail of their lives and businesses would be replaced with a simple-to-understand and easy-to-enforce tax code.  People would be flush with money.  The higher taxes on the property would therefore be tolerable.  Property is something that everyone needs to survive (whether owned or rented), so the prices would not be significantly depressed, especially since everyone would have more money to begin with.  Few would move to another country because net-and-net their financial situation would be about the same.  The plan could be revenue neutral.  And people live in the United States because their friends and family are here, and it is a beautiful and secure country.;1;1;False;Always_Question;en4h5xh;Today in Congress Rep.

"Are you seriously so obtuse that you stretch your argument to suggest that a room dividing wall is somehow equal in scope and purpose to a multi billion dollar money sink to be built across several states and essentially be an endless money pit for Trump Corporation to suck tax dollars from?

Do you really think that snake oil salesman gives a damn about anything but himself and his Trump brand ?

He’s a con man. 

To your second argument about poverty and contributing nothing to society and just taking.  Do you mean like the caravan of Americans that just crossed into Canada to buy insulin at 1/10th the price ? 

Isn’t it normal to want a better life?

Wouldn’t you do the same ?

They don’t take. They do jobs most Americans won’t do. 

Many of them come with nothing and then build business and contribute to their communities. Your xenophobic hate blinds you to the fact that ALL Americans (except Native American Indians) came from other countries.

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore,”

"Property tax would be tied to the owner of the property.  Tenants would not directly pay any tax (although the tax would be ""built in"" to the cost of the rent).  Each property has an assessed and market price.  This is already done by most counties in the nation, so we know how to do that.  The progressive nature of the tax would be based on either assessed or market value (most likely assessed, since that is how non-progressive property taxes work presently, so it would be easy to adopt for a progressive property tax).  So for an owner of multiple properties, the tax bracket would be based on the aggregate value of all of the owner's properties.  Properties owned by pass-through entities would have the value of the properties ""passed through"" to the aggregate value of the owner's property, sort of like income gets passed through today.'

&#x200B;

As for a real-world example, nearly half of the population today pays no federal income tax.  Since this would be a revenue-neutral plan, the property taxes would be low or non-existent for a household that today pays no federal income tax.  This can easily be managed by how the progressive property tax rates are set.  Again, people would net-and-net be in about the same financial situation as they are today.  The BIG benefits, however, include that the oppressive tracking requirements would be gone, tax compliance would be near 100% because evasion would be nigh impossible, nobody could obfuscate their tax obligations using cryptography, and work and success would be incentivized.";1;0;False;Always_Question;en4nfjl;Today in Congress Rep.

"i picked one recent incident that was not covered by the mass media, I'm not about to sit here and dig up all the evidence about illegal immigrants committing specific crimes that you would consider worthy of noting, because lets be honest, even if i did find 10 recent crimes that were actually covered in the media, you would just come back with another rebuttal.

Regarding gun control, I'll say this one more time incase you missed it. CRIMINALS DO NOT AND WILL NOT FOLLOW THE LAW.

We have almost 400 million hand guns in the USA, that's almost half of all handguns in the world (and this is obviously just an estimate, we have no idea how many illegally obtained black market guns are in the world). We have more handguns than humans in this country. If you really think stripping LAW ABIDING CITIZENS of their one way of protecting themselves, leaving CRIMINALS the only people left with guns is going to save lives, then you're honestly delusional. Criminals who didn't turn in their guns will now be able to rob you without even having to worry, they'll be long gone before any cops show up.

Also I'm not sure if you know this but the USA admits more LEGAL immigrants yearly than any other country in the world, and the number hasn't decreased with trump. Nobody that supports trump or the wall thinks immigration is bad, we think ILLEGAL immigration is bad, it's like trying to stop a faucet from running by holding bowls underneath to collect the water instead of turning off the FLOW and cleaning up the mess.";1;1;False;fatassdab;en3kaoc;Today in Congress Rep.

"> Obama shut the government down, not sure where you get your information.

No, that is a lie. What actually happened is that the Republican Congress refused to pass a budget and instead shut down the government and then blamed Obama.   They also obstructed even holding hearings for a Supreme Court justice and instead left the seat vacant for a year in clear dereliction of their duties as congressmen because of racism towards Obama.  The Republican Party only cares about securing power for the Republican elites. They do not care about the republic nor do they care about you.  All of their policies are directly related to tipping the system in the favor of the ultra rich and powerful. Go look it up. 

> Walls do work for the ones crossing the border that way.  (which would help ease the economic pressure we've put on ourselves for helping these leeches)

Lies, they do not work. They have never worked in any country in history.  

> Colossal waist? are you fat shaming?

No, the waste is the government spending trillions on war when we don’t even have decent free healthcare or education.  Higher level education is free in Germany. Healthcare is inexpensive or free in the rest of the world. The reason things cost so much in America is because of the for profit systems where we literally are paying extra to make CEOs rich so they can deny us healthcare when we need it. 



> All else aside, I agree capitalism isn't perfect, nothing about any government is perfect. But I'm not okay with getting taxed to pay for little Juan Pablo who just hopped the border from Mexico's college and healthcare. It all starts with secure borders, we don't even know how many illegal people are in the country.. how are we supposed to account for anything if they just keep coming in from poor countries and siphoning our tax dollars out of socialist programs.

Stop lying. 

You should care that you are being taxed to pay for Wall Street banker’s mistakes and for sending missies into other countries in order to secure the USD as global reserve currency.  That costs a hell of a lot more than some tacos. How about you put your money where your mouth is and compete as a CAPITALIST with Juan ? If he’s willing to do the same job for less money then you shouldn’t get the job, he should. 

As far as Juan using our healthcare system. We ALL should be able to use it and we all should pay together.  Juan will pay taxes too if you let him. 

You are a selfish person who doesn’t understand that you are not in a vacuum. If Mexico does well we also do well. 

I urge you to stop being so terrified of “socialism” why don’t you instead think of it as “democratic capitalism” because that’s what it is. 

We pool our money together to help those of us that are not able to help ourselves and in so doing become a more perfect union.

"I'll just put some FACTS here, I don't want to debate or argue.  
Dems are pushing for any and all forms of abortion, even after the child has been born. (Yes you heard that right, and you can look it up) I'm not against rape abortions by any means obviously, I actually care about people's well being.

Illegal immigrants DO commit many crimes, you just don't hear about it because the media is controlled by the left. Why didn't we hear about the shooting in Colorado anymore once it was revealed the shooters were gay and trans persons? Because it doesn't fit the narrative.  
Last month, a sheriff was killed by an illegal immigrant in Washington, the first on duty death in over 40 years. Guess who killed him? Juan Manuel Flores Del Toro, an illegal immigrant. So illegal immigrants actually DO commit crimes.  


A note about these camps you talk about, you want to know why we have to have these camps? because illegal immigrants are flooding into the country and we can't keep up. The backlog is already up to 850,000 which means we're dealing with ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS instead of helping LEGAL IMMIGRANTS get citizenship. How is that fair to anyone trying to become a citizen the correct way?

Gun control will lead to more deaths. You see what they did with the stupid GUN FREE ZONE signs? over 90% of mass shootings happened.... IN GUN FREE ZONES.

Criminals don't and won't follow the law, and a police officer with a gun isn't going to be able to save you when he's over 5 minutes away, sometimes they just don't even show up.

That is not how freedom of speech works. Freedom of speech means that the government can not silence you for criticizing it. It does not give you the rights to harass or attack other people.

"The US government *could* shut down Bitcoin, functionally at least. It would be very expensive politically, but they certainly could do it. How? By passing a law making it illegal to exchange BTC for USD (or any fiat). This law would, in typical US fashion, extend to punishing foreign companies with a US presence that facilitated this trade overseas. At a stroke, all on and off ramps would be closed. The BTC price would collapse. And presumably this law would also cover Ethereum and the other cryptos. This would all but shut down the nascent blockchain industry - certainly public blockchains. 

The problem for the politicians like Mr Sherman is that millions of Americans are already invested in Bitcoin and other cryptos. Voters do not respond well when you destroy their wealth. Unless the law could be passed in a bipartisan way, the political cost would almost certainly be too high. Moreover, the millions of people in Europe and elsewhere who also own Bitcoin and other crypto would turn strongly anti-American with further political and economic cost. 

Far simpler for the US government to control this sector in another way: simply buy a sufficient percentage of circulating Bitcoin. The cost would be extremely modest - very possibly zero in the long term. The government could then relax about the supposed anarchic consequences (a trivial threat IMHO) of BTC. 

How many BTC would the Treasury need to acquire? Not even close to a majority of available BTC. Simply being the largest holder would offer effective price control. Two or three million BTC would easily cover it. This would not be a sunk cost, remember. This would be like the government's holding of gold or SDRs - an asset that can (and would be) constantly traded to help stabilize the dollar and wider economy. Quite a bolster to the US's balance sheet I would have thought - especially as every other country and commercial bank would immediately follow suit. Far from relinquishing control and risking foreign dominance (or anarchy), the US could easily cement its position as the world's principal economic power. The danger, in fact, would be that people would come to see BTC as an American artefact, controlled by a government - the very thing some hodlers are keen to avoid. In practice, of course, most people have no interest in notions of sovereign economics or even sound money. They just want to benefit from new technology and hopefully make a bit of profit. 

In any case, if we want to stop the US (or any other government) passing anti-BTC laws, then the answer is to onboard as many new people as possible, and to do it quickly. Another 100 million worldwide and no government could do more than huff and puff.";2;0;False;Nullius_123;en3pgqo;Today in Congress Rep. Sherman called for a bill to ban all cryptocurrencies.

Taxes on property can be made progressive based on assessed or market value.  For example, for those who own real estate worth less than $200,000, no tax.  Between $200,000 and $400,000, 15%.  Between $400,000 to $1,000,000, 25%.  Over $1,000,000, 35%.  The amount of tax could be set to any amount necessary to cover modern social safety net programs.

">It’s just a digital item with a strong verification system

It's a protocol with a unique and variable immutability defined by the protocol participants. That's a pretty interesting value proposition if you ask me.

These token price jumps up and down are an inevitable roller coaster as we slowly penetrate global markets and users engage in the most fleeting of the value propositions Bitcoin makes possible, speculation. But some percentage of those speculators will be enthralled by the technology and the gains and stick around through the next dump and the cycle of ebbing and flowing growth will continue.";11;0;False;MrRGnome;en4pkyd;I’ve waited an entire year to post this;bn8ofv;https://v.redd.it/v77fdzjxrix21
