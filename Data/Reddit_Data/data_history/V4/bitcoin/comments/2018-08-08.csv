"What if the spike in Mastercard use breaks their network?  Then the media will talk about It nonstop showing huge lines of people in front of ATMs, which will only prompt more people to the nearest ATM, and the panic will start.

Things happen fast when EVERYBODY is rushing in the same direction and the media feeds gasoline to the fire in a nonstop vicious circle.

A few month ago in Brazil the [truck drivers went on a strike ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/brazil-truckers-roads-president-temer-economy)  Just a regular strike.  But over there 99% of the economy depends on them, including the gas for pump on Gas stations.

First there were the huge lines on gas stations, that lasted for 24 hours, until their tanks were emptied.  Then people realised food, water, medicine, NOTHING was being delivered.  There was a rush for that too, but nothing insane.

And then the Gas in peoples autos and public transport tanks finished.  Schools were closed and semi-holidays (optional days) were decreed.

in about 5 days the country (the worlds 8th or 9th biggest economy, if I'm not mistaken) stopped functioning.

In Alaska they say that It's not the winter that gets you, It's being badly prepared for the winter that gets you.

People sound crazy until something happens and a chain reaction starts.  By then It's too late.

I say a stash of water, gas, and mostly Bitcoin is essential.

"I think censorship resistance is one of important foundations on which Bitcoin must be built.

"In a world where all money was replaced with just 21M bitcoins, the value of those bitcoins would reflect the size of the economy, which keeps growing as population keeps growing, increasing both production and demand. The closer Bitcoin gets to that, the less volatility and the more stable growth it will experience. I think censorship resistance is just a tiny part of that value.

And ETH... that's an interesting case. Its smart contacts are already much more useful than Bitcoin, but it's being managed in such a shady way that I still can't figure out whether it will crash and burn spectacularly, or have a very real chance of overshadowing BTC.

So you get the exposure to the upward (and downward) movements of an investment but the ability to easily spend them at any time.

nope, I'm implying it doesn't need that much of a drop for people to get sweaty, bitcoin is so experimental and really nothing is guaranteed, that it makes you sweaty no matter what. sure there are people as cool as the guys in the roller coaster, but that's people who have other solid incomes and see their bitcoin investment as disposable anyways. but what about all ppl who dollar cost average expecting this experiment not to fail? personally I don't know about the future of any of this, I just know if you can walk away with a profit out of this, do it, if you walk away with a lambo out of this, you're lucky. everything else is explained by a host of theories around speculations and maybe self fulfilling prophecy-theory. of course anyone can speculate on this and buy as much as they want, even more than they can afford to lose, but in that case, they will need to expect the price to rise from here, and to do this, they look at the charts and see that bitcoin has always recovered so far. so it must recover again, right? well, no. absolutely not, as past performance does not warrant future performance. if anything, you need to use your brain to find out whether bitcoin is over or undervalued, or valued just right. some price won't go lower as it costs miners to produce one bitcoin, but this does not apply if the smart ppl and big holders in the space start thinking something is rotten, either with miner centralization, or some other kind of centralization or market fraud. one other good indicator of overvaluation of this new asset, is if people are fixated on it's dollar equivalent price, and keep pushing out price increasing mantras, instead of necessary uncomfortable discussions, about whether tether is backed or a good thing to have in this space. so if focus on price is still high, or too high in your opinion, then price is probably artificially inflated or plain too high. there are a host of issues and features of all of crypto, which have no place in the sidebar of this sub for example, but are not regularly discussed in forums either, personally I will get bullish again, once bitcoin's biggest fundamental issues are discussed in the open, and the results of these discussions pinned or linked to easily consumed by visitors.;1;0;False;;e3umrqq;Bitcoin veterans right now;95jjnn;https://media.giphy.com/media/z9fRQNJmBrGRa/giphy.gif

"I understand the concept. I've supported it for a long time, very long. Lightning network gives hope. But at the moment Bitcoin has been proven it's broken. So people should not get their hopes up that Bitcoin is going to magically rise to 100,00k. People are more savvy now. Hence what we are seeing. The Blockchain technology is interesting. I just don't believe bitcoin will be what people use as a worldwide currency. It's basically a gamble at this point to keep money in, which I'm not willing to risk anymore. 

In the beginning it looked very promising but we have moved on, there will be something that comes along which improves on th technology. I think most people here have a lot invested, so have a bias without knowing anything really about how it works. Seems more like blind faith at times. Most of the top posts here are memes, and quotes by rich people saying bitcoin will rise to 10 million dollars by 2021, very few interesting articles about the technology.

That's soo cute, thinking that OUR government would ever allow another currency to displace the dollar. All they have to do is make it illegal to accept bitcoin as currency, and BAM, its all gone. Do you really think that you'll be able to keep using it for it's purchasing power, when there isn't any left? Sure, you might be able to buy something illegally from overseas, but how's that working for others who regularly do it now? They get their accounts seized, and likely arrested at the airport, that's what they get.;2;0;False;Not_A_Bot__Really;e3ue5o4;Bitcoin veterans right now;95jjnn;https://media.giphy.com/media/z9fRQNJmBrGRa/giphy.gif

"I think Bitcoin vets are the people collecting the coins that fell out when the ride looped. My cost average is under $1000 but I regret not selling high and using that money on these swings. If you can invest in something that swings 30%+ in this short period of time you can beat the stock market by just trading the swings.   


If I was to do that with a stock broker he will charge me to buy and sell and on top of that I need the investment to swing up bigger than analytical data projected. ";3;0;False;TheMiddle-AgedWaiter;e3twqt5;Bitcoin veterans right now;95jjnn;https://media.giphy.com/media/z9fRQNJmBrGRa/giphy.gif

Anyone can see we are heading for stagnation right now. It’ll settle around 5k, that’s my prediction, even if that is a pointless and arbitrary one. 

I really love the tech but I’m more excited to see it break out of just being a investor’s speculative store of value.
