"MtGox halted trading on February 24, 2014, and bitcoin was trading in the high $500's that day, however it fell to around $450 the following day, and was trading at around $800 before they halted withdrawals on February 7, 2014. I don't think this would hold up in court, but one might argue that bitcoin should have been valued at $800, which would roughly double the claims, however even if this happened, there would be a lot of bitcoin left over. 


I am not familiar with Japanese bankruptcy law, however in the US, when a company is liquidated, creditors are paid first, and after creditors are repaid in full, anything left over goes to shareholders. I really cannot imagine a scenario in which creditors would receive many times the amount of money they are owed, if this were allowed under the law, I don't think anyone would ever invest in equity of Japanese companies.

"If assets go to auction and they make more than is owed to creditors, who should the excess go to? You have to remember that a lot of time the value of the company belongs to stockholders. Your method would basically say, take stockholder money and give it to creditors to punish bad management even though the creditors have been made whole.

The issue here is that the assets were bitcoins and that laws typically resolve obligations in the nations currency. When the court ruling occurred and converted everything into fiat the price was artificially low because of the crash caused by the bankruptcy and is now exploding in value. The crash and explosion are both only really possible in very small markets. I doubt anyone is going to rewrite legislation to handle edge cases in tiny markets.
