Until now, making a purchase with your phone is something that , in public's eye, only being done by ""tech-smart""  or ""geekie"" people.

 ""Normal"" people will use normal stuff: cash or plastic cards.. Cos if it has no physical thing, it's not money (which is silly cos plastic card is not money) 

---

This limits the implementation of NFC by merchants.. And even if they have, it just stuck there in the corner, cos:

- no one ask for it anyway
- the cashiers are not familiar in how to operate it.. Makes everything slow

---
Apple wants to change this, with costly ads & negotiations with merhants/visa etc.

apple wants nfc stations (& capable cashiers to operate them) on every store, 

and more importantly, apple wants *the public to be comfortable in doing digital transaction* using your phone as your wallet.

---

To me,  *public that is comfortable in doing digital transaction* is a step closer to bitcoin adoption

"> issues surrounding contractual deals with the various institutions involved in such transactions

That would explain why they didn't introduce apple pay until now, which makes total sense.

But it doesn't explain why they didn't add NFC to generations of phones previous, which would make them capable of using apple pay once they did iron out the contracts, not to mention the myriad benefits of NFC for non-payment uses in the mean time.

Android phones have had NFC for years, it's not that large of an engineering challenge in general, and certainly not a challenge that a company like Apple couldn't have figured it out at least as early as handset manu's like HTC, Acer, Asus, LG, and Huawei.

No, the only reason to introduce NFC in the 6 and no earlier is [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence).";2;1;False;NitroTwiek;ckgcd88;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg

In other words, nothing prevented Apple from putting NFC in a phone as early as the 4s that would be technologically compatible with the payment system in the 6/6+.

>I wonder if malware could snag that camera image? Otherwise if you type it, I wonder if malware can intercept it then? I wonder if it's possible to intercept a transaction and attempt a double spend?

The card is photographed one time and then authenticated. The card number is discarded and never stored on the device or in the cloud. An account number is verified with the authentication chip built in with each transaction. You need your fingerprint to authenticate a transaction. It's extremely secure.

Also this isn't android, there really is little to no chance of malware like you're describing on the platform (unless you jailbreak then all bets are off).

"> So Apple gets a cut of all transactions according to sources I've read. Does this mean they act as a central clearinghouse? If not how can they account for the transactions? I guess they could just trust visa to operate transparently...

They payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, etc) would have to go through Apple to map the ""Device Account Number"" and transaction-specific dynamic security code to an actual bank account / credit card. If that's the case, that information would also probably include enough information for Apple to determine how much their cut is. If Apple's just charging a flat-rate ""swipe"" fee, no information about the transaction other than the fact it occurred is needed.

> As I understand it you can enter your card information by photographing your cards. Is this true?

Yes and no. The app just does some optical character recognition to get the card number so you don't have to type it in yourself. You can use the camera to enter your credit card information into the phone, but the image is never saved to your camera roll, let alone to iCloud.

> I wonder if malware could snag that camera image?

This would be incredibly difficult to do on a non-jailbroken iOS device. iOS is incredibly locked down specifically to prevent things like this (which is why Android fans talk about how much of a 'closed' platform iOS is). Passbook would need to save the image to the camera roll (which it doesn't), and the malicious app must have been installed, explicitly granted access to your photos, and then be opened or have background app refresh enabled in order to send it to their servers.

> Otherwise if you type it, I wonder if malware can intercept it then? 

Third party keyboards in iOS cannot access the internet.

> I wonder if it's possible to intercept a transaction and attempt a double spend?

Each transaction has a transaction-specific dynamic security code.

> At the end of the day it's still visa transactions going over the same old legacy network. I think it's debatable that ApplePay is safer.

">I wonder if malware could snag that camera image? Otherwise if you type it, I wonder if malware can intercept it then? I wonder if it's possible to intercept a transaction and attempt a double spend?

This isn't Android.  Unless you use a third party keyboard on iOS (which when you load, they tell you the risks involved).  Apps are sandboxed in such a way to prevent other apps from capturing keystrokes, or images without granting access.  Not to mention it such malware would need to be installed via the App Store vs Android where someone could easily and ignorantly sideload malware unknowingly.  Transaction specific codes (see below) are generated for each purpose.  And let's say for argument sake that something does happen.  You simply call your credit card company, report the fraud and reverse the charges.  

> I think it's debatable that ApplePay is safer.

Your name, your credit card number, the details of the purchase are not shared with the vendor.  

>Every time you hand over your credit or debit card to pay, your card number and identity are visible. With Apple Pay, instead of using your actual credit and debit card numbers when you add your card, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in iPhone and Apple Watch. These numbers are never stored on Apple servers. And when you make a purchase, the Device Account Number alongside a transaction-specific dynamic security code is used to process your payment. So your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared with merchants or transmitted with payment.

Yes and that's definitely a plus. But I still have some unanswered questions about ApplePay. 

So Apple gets a cut of all transactions according to sources I've read.  Does this mean they act as a central clearinghouse? If not how can they account for the transactions? I guess they could just trust visa to operate transparently...

As I understand it you can enter your card information by photographing your cards. Is this true?

"You often do that with passwords too. You get a hold of the password hash by intercepting the login request, maybe the session hash, then you brute force it offline.

The thing about brute forcing, though, is that it demands a whole lot of processing power and time, enough time for the session hash to be useless and perhaps the password hash too (I'm not sure, but I'm guessing secure systems frequently change their private key).

I thought everyone who makes login systems included a small timeout on 5 or so consecutive failed login attempts; hell, the beginner tutorial I read on making a basic login with python even had a timeout.

also, when you buy any product, you don't even have to sign anything or agree to anything. simply by using their product you are bound to their terms of use, which almost always include binding arbitration... the onus is on you to look up what the terms of use are.

"Oh, there you go, reason #4 for why Apple didn't put NFC in the iPhone 5/5s...

You know what you call that?  Waiting until a piece of technology is in popular use before supporting it in order to force your customers to buy new hardware so they can use the new feature... You know what that's called?  It's called **planned obsolescence**.

You know who's going to benefit most from Apple Pay?  The users of the 416 million **non-Apple phones** with NFC, because, unlike iPhone owners, *they won't have to buy a new phone to be able to pay with it*.  Because the manufactures of those phones thought ahead instead of designing their phones with the explicit purpose of forcing existing customers to buy new ones.  Think about that: Owners of the *4 year old* Nexus S benefit more from Apple Pay than iPhone 5/5s owners.  How can you *possibly* call that anything but planned obsolescence?
  

So which reason is it... Why did Apple wait until the end of 2014 to finally add an industry standard technology that's been in phones since before the iPhone existed?

1) They didn't have the retail payment deals until now  
2) It was just too damn much of a technologically challenge for Apple (until now)  
3) It isn't/wasn't useful  (until now)  
4) Nobody uses it  (until now)

Because I have refuted every single one of those reasons.

"I don't think most ""bitcoiners"" are looking to evade taxes. Taxes are too high, but evading them isn't the solution.

First, you're talking from the perspective of somebody that lives in a stable, first world country. 

Second, the benefits of bitcoin run much deeper for merchants and consumers. For example, if you accept credit cards, you are charged about 3% of your sale. If you accept bitcoin there are no monthly fees, and it costs no more than pennies.

On the more political side of things, a lot of people don't like dealing with banks that scoop up billions, nor are they terribly fond of the fractional reserve system of banking. They'd rather use money as money--a peer-to-peer system of exchange without any intermediaries that may inflate the money supply.

This is about freedom of choice. You don't have to stop using the dollar. If anything, an alternative like bitcoin should force governments to be more responsible with their money.

So your addresses will be changed around without you even knowing. And instead of backing up a private key, you just write down 12 to 24 words to be able to restore all these addresses.

> In his first interview on the subject, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said celebrities' iCloud accounts were compromised when hackers correctly answered security questions to obtain their passwords, or when they were victimized by a phishing scam to obtain user IDs and passwords.

> He said none of the Apple IDs and passwords leaked from the company's servers.

"Just let it play itself out. There's no reasoning with them. There's blood in the water and there's a frenzy and like aways, it's a bunch of rabid weasels fucking in a burlap bag. 

Also, trying to point out it was actresses with easily guessed passwords(not putting the blame on them btw, it has more to do with education of how to properly do passwords, something not everyone automagically knows) along social engineering and not that Apple was 'hacked' is like beating your head against a wall. Apple certainly didn't help matters with no rate-limiting on password guesses (only patched last Monday), nor do they encrypt phone data backed up via iCloud (something they have to fix). There were failings, yes. But no true ""hacks"". 

I honestly wished it were a ""hack"", as it would be something they could easily patch. But with this type of thing, they have to go with the much harder endeavor of teaching their users to use 2factor, using non-guessable passwords and things like that AND changing the way they do things internally. 

In terms of using this for payments, actually read up on how they do it and how will keep your payments safe and secure...much more secure than giving a waiter your credit card and they walk off with it.

Apple is the company that popularize digital purchase for music, movies & apps..  (And books & magazines to some extent)

And now they are on their way to popularize ""digital"" transaction, so we are going to be able to authorize payment with nfc & fingerprint scanner.

Until now merchants don't care so much about nfc, cos although google wallets has been launched for years, nobody is using it. 

Now, Apple is betting their money in being able to change this. They are on a crusade in making non-techie people comfortable in using nfc/phone & merchants to accept this new method. A crusade that will cost them a lot of money (advertisement, educating the costumer, working with merchant/ visa )

This is good news for android users like me, who for sure will be benefited by having more merchant accept nfc payment incuding google wallets (of course instead of fingerprint, i need to enter my PIN instead... But I'm sure future android phones will have fingerprint scanner as well)

This is also good news for people like us, who love our digital currencies. A society that comfortable is doing digital transaction everywhere is a step closer to digital currency adoption.

I think people are just poking fun.

"This is a huge coup for the credit card companies, and why they're giving Apple a nice kickback. Basically it's as frictionless and secure as the credit card system is going to get, and the companies are hoping Apple Pay cements their status in the new digital economy.

As for security, Apple claims that everything stays on the device, is encrypted, and isn't transmitted to merchants as their actual info - rather, a jumbled one-time string that might prevent another Target fiasco. Another reason the credit card companies are banking big on this - they don't want to deal with that hacking crap (on a mass scale) any longer.

That said, I think Apple Pay will start getting compromised on the level of the individual user. It will start with people who use simple passwords (you might as well use no encryption at all) and then it will expand to others who fall for phishing attacks, and so on. I'm sure hackers will come up with other ingenious schemes, because Apple Pay users are going to be a huge target.";39;6;False;CryptoSean;ckg5ise;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg
"Hacking into Apple Pay would be pointless. They don't store anything.

> With Apple Pay, instead of using your actual credit and debit card numbers when you add your card, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in iPhone. These numbers are never stored on Apple servers. And when you make a purchase, the Device Account Number alongside a transaction-specific dynamic security code is used to process your payment. So your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared with merchants or transmitted with payment.

> Apple doesn’t save your transaction information. With Apple Pay, your payments are private. Apple doesn’t store the details of your transactions so they can’t be tied back to you.";1;0;False;nvolker;ckgdqxn;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg

Not a fair jab.  For instance eBay was hacked earlier this year.  Yet PayPal wasn't.  All the hackers got was info that you'd find in a phone book.  Why's that?  I have a hunch Apple has better protections available regarding your payment info than they have for your credit cards.  I doubt they even give you your own credit info even when you are logged in as it is customary to not do this.;5;1;False;rydan;ckg53r7;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg
