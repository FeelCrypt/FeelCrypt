Thanks for sharing. I will surely read this from the first page til the end while doing my trades in Paxful.;1;0;False;DWilliams1992;djm1p89;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper. It's 8 pages long and still the most lucid description of the system that I've ever read.;6dsot4;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
Dont get me wrong, I am not sinking my entire life savings into crypto. That would be unwise. But i have definitely taken a long term position in bitcoin and litecoin to a lesser extent. At this point no matter what, i am not selling. There are alot of smart minds in this space, they have confidence in this technology and the ability for this to grow. Life is about risk/reward. Sometimes gotta take the risk.;1;0;False;Jsweezy1212;djkytgj;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
"Day late and 0.00040 bitcoins short, but hi!

QE is unfair on the general population, but arguably less 'unfair' than simply allowing them to get absolutely wrecked in a depression. The natural outcome of a market crash like that is a fairly disruptive depression which (based on past depressions which had limited or no intervention) usually ends worst for the middle and lower classes.

I don't understand exactly what you mean by ""false stock market belief"", but my guess is you mean that it basically artificially inflates confidence? My counterpoint would be, it's not any more artificial than any other aspect of currency, bitcoin or otherwise.

>Your point about volatility affecting the everyday price of goods and services is valid, however the idea is that once there is enough market cap and liquidity in Bitcoin, this volatility should decrease.

I don't follow this argument at all. What evidence do you have that larger currency bases are less volatile? We just watched a gigantic market crash in 2008, one so large that it took the largest currency intervention in human history to simply make it a huge recession instead of a literal Great Depression V2.0 - and the ""market cap and liquidity"" in that market was literally the entire market cap and liquidity. All of it.

I suppose ""falls down less often but just as explosively"" is sort of less volatile, but I'm not sure ""well, sure, we're giving up all of the ways we can manage a market failure, but it's cool, because it'll only fail once every 30 years instead of once every 5"" is actually a compelling argument.

>There are many other downsides to QE, such as constant inflation (which i don't believe is a good thing - I don't buy the ""hoarding"" theory, where people continue to hoard a deflating currency/asset, supposedly crashing the economy). 

... I guess I find this hard to understand, since it's sort of a ""theory"" the way ""gravity"" is a theory? Like, you're pretty much challenging one of the most accepted and well supported points in all of economics. People like to poke fun at the ""rational actors"" jokes, but humans are actually largely capable of making sound decisions on individual points - when currency is appreciating, people begin to view it as an investment tool and use it to store wealth instead of spending it. You're literally in a community that's been dealing with the impact of that - most people hold bitcoin as a speculative tool rather than to spend it. The best thing to do with your bitcoin at the moment is put it in your mattress and wait for it to be worth more.

>I could go on, but in summary I believe the Keynesian system is flawed, and creates a kind of ""crony capitalism"" whereby banks, investors and rich people in general benefit, while the majority are worse off.

It's really easy to argue against a current system when you point out all the worst aspects of the current system and handwave stuff like ""well sure we have no way to prevent another Great Depression, but it's a feature, not a bug!""";1;1;False;Zaeron;djlbvuv;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
"> ...AND nobody has any way to use monetary policy to fix that.

That's an interesting point.

"We didn't think this silly 4chan thing would be so serious. At least that's my justification. Who would've known?? Hey, if it's any help I've heard from ""top analyst"" that I can reach up to one million per Bitcoin. So we still have a chance hopefully. For now I'm going to by a few bits.
