"you are expressing my concerns perfectly. IMO you are exactly right. 

I feel like there are not many companies helping spreading bitcoin like they used to. Bitpay was revolutionary. I remember when many stores started accepting btc but that kinda declined... Now the money goes to exchanges and ICOs. It's not about the revolutionary technology but more about speculation and profits.

Also people don't seem to realize that deflation can be very damaging to the economy just like inflation...

">use BTC beyond speculation

It can't be confiscated by the Government. Imagine all the Doctors/Lawyers/Government officials hiding wealth/Business people/Criminals/People avoiding alimony or court orders with billions upon billions that will put all their ""spare"" money in Bitcoin purely because of this.

This use case is here right now and used right now, then incorporate all the other uses. International remittance/transferring wealth through borders without approval from anyone. NOTHING else in this entire World can do this!

Literally anyone with any real sum of money is desperately looking for ""Bitcoin"" as the solution to literally ALL their most serious concerns about their wealth, i.e keeping it! This is *entirely* outside of the speculation and the possibility of having these benefits AND make money at the same time.

">That would actually worry me - if that's a primary use, then governments will block it.

What if individual governments *need* to embrace it to try to contain it? China went to ban it, then USA was making all the progress with the start-ups, Russia went to ban it now they are funding the worlds largest mine. 

Why did these two countries do a full U-Turn after initially setting up to ban it? Their knee jerk reaction was just like yours, what could possibly have changed their minds?

If you ban it then it becomes used everywhere else you have zero leverage in it, your domestic company doesn't become a global brand. In short you lose out massively in so many ways and then your population uses it anyway with international infrastructure. Alas in this situation it is not so simple just to say ""Well if people use it for certain things it will get banned"".

What do you think the purpose of numbered accounts and offshore accounts was for the past 50 years? Just criminals and tax avoidance? Of course not, they used them yes, but all forms of financial planning used these offshore accounts. Anyone that could be sued in LEGAL business (Doctors/Lawyers/Politicians/Rich husbands or wifes) put their money into offshore accounts as it was the standard for asset protection. Note that in the last 5 years they've become all but obsolete because they are centralized. In comes decentralized Bitcoin.

The thing about bitcoin is that it is a currency, though. If more people get to know it it can become a widespread form of payment. And thus increase in value and stability. You're right that it will crash if it used just as a fast way to make money, but I think it is slowly becoming a genuine way to store money. And once it becomes more widely adopted and the tech grows it can be a widespread payment method.;4;1;False;lgspeck;dlizjs3;$100 checkpoints be like;6t79hw;https://media.giphy.com/media/RnxAq60OO27S0/giphy.gif

Oh sorry, I meant using your explanation it's a bit like gold. Everyone wants to hold it rather than spend it. I think that's certainly the case for a lot of people, but you shouldn't discount the absolutely huge amount of people who still spend it daily. In that sense, it's not like gold.

"What are you trying to say here? That because we had a pullback of 75% back in 2013 we will have a pullback of 75% on the next occasion?

If we're going to base our expected size of a correction on the worst one in ""modern"" BTC history, we should also look at the bullrun that came prior. In 2013 the Bitcoin price roughly 10'xd in 8-10 weeks before falling 75%. If we apply the same timelines to this market we would need to see a price at $20k+ which would still leave us above $5k after the 75% pullback.

Granted, I think it's stupid to expect the same behaviour in todays market since it is *much* more liquid and global (dozens of exchanges instead of one in the MtGox days).

Still, I think $20k in 10 weeks is probably as likely as a 75% pullback from here. Neither are likely at all.

You're thinking of waypoints on a journey.  As far as I can tell, checkpoints in this context simply refer to hitting number divisible by 100.  Nothing in forex suggests that you can't rise to 100 (or 500, or 7300, or whatever), then fall, then rise to the same point again.  I'm asking if bitcoin is different, and if so, SPECIFICALLY how it's different.

"> a never ending pool of people finding out about it

Which won't continue indefinitely...  Eventually interest will taper off and the pool of people that are both likely to want to buy BTC and don't already know about it will shrink to near-zero.

The single most significant thing that should scare an 'investor' away from an investment is that the fundamental driver of growth is other people buying it because the price has been growing.  That's true of any stock or commodity.  A feedback loop with no underlying value is incredibly risky - you're not investing at that point, you're just gambling.  Maybe it keeps growing, maybe it crashes, but the idea that people are '''investing''' without even having the foggiest clue about what's driving up the value besides other people buying is astounding.

"I'm guessing everyone here is speculating and not planning on using BTC as an actual currency, but is that still an end goal for the BTC community? Rapid deflation like this can't be sustained if anyone is ever going to complete regular transactions with BTC that were held (rather than exchanging and immediately making a transaction, which also defeats the purpose of BTC being used as 'regular' money). No one wants to spend money on a pizza if the next day the same amount of money could buy them a graphics card. And if it never reaches a sustainable real use the speculation train will end somewhere. I've read articles about banks using the tech to replace the traditional clearing house system, but that doesn't require use of the BTC as currency itself, does it? They may even create a private chain.

Does anyone really know the fundamentals driving the price up for BTC? It can't be just the HBO hacking and other ransom requests, and if it were that'd be very bad for BTC (public image as the currency of criminals, possible regulation, etc).

Imagine this, the same sentence has been said and listening atleast a million times. So you are not first nor is the message new.

You are correct. The way it's happening now can be equated to buying Amazon shares during the times of dotcom bubble..
It sounds surreal. And at some point the speculation will stop and stability will start..
