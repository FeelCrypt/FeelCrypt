No one's saying laws banning something completely stop it 100%. Murder is illegal but people still murder. However, laws do dramatically cut down on the action. Controlled substances can be bought illegally, but they're not as accessible as they would be if they could be sold over the counter. Alcohol was available during prohibition, but in limited quantities and in poor quality. After prohibition, quality increased and quantity skyrocketed. Sure, if government tried to ban Bitcoin, some people would still be doing it, but 100% of the exchanges would close and probably 99% of users wouldn't want to bother with the hassle.

"The real problem with bitcoin is that it is not backed by anything. Its wildly volatile price is as a result of the fact that it is only worth what people believe it is worth. I admit traditional fiat money is not a perfect system, much like capitalism, but it's the best thing we have. To talk about fiat being a completely different thing to BTC is hilarious in its own right. At least fiat money is backed by something/someone. BTC is backed by absolutely nothing other than the belief of people. Once governments start to denounce BTC and other cryptos, the price will drop as people have less and less faith in it, whether it is justified or not.

At its core, BTC has an intrinsic, fundamental and paradoxical issue. Peoples faith in it causes and is as a result of how the price changes, and the two are extremely proportional. The more the price drops, the less faith people have and so the more the price drops and the less faith people have. Now you might think that this isn't any different to fiat currency, or stock exchanges, but that's not true. In the case of fiat currency, the government are able to do things to stabilise the value. In the case of stock exchanges, the companies have real physical presences and tangible assets. These are things that BTC cannot offer, and when all is said and done, BTC is just 1s and 0s.

In your eyes, when all governments inevitably ban the use of BTC for goods and services, the world will be overturned by the crypto army, and fiat money will be a thing of the past.

"I think the main point is that Bitcoin is global. So even if one country banned it, it would require near global banning in order to be effective. If bitcoin has value ANYWHERE, bitcoin has value EVERYWHERE. Most people only transact with any given fiat currency in one given country, that doesn’t mean those currencies are worthless. So even if only one country values and utilizes bitcoin, it will thus have value and therefore, because of its global nature, it will have value everywhere. Liquidity will obviously vary from region to region and its use as a medium of exchange will vary from region to region as well. But bitcoin doesn’t require those things EVERYWHERE in order for it to have tremendous value.

This is even before you get into the fact, as others mentioned, that decentralized exchanging will be very prevalent in the near future that will make banning it in any given region extremely difficult due to the fact that it won’t even be known that such a transaction is taking place.";2;1;False;lifeanon269;ec2l6zo;Once you understand how bitcoin works, you also understand how futile banning it is..

"jeez ... op ... you don't get it.

either,  


(1) bitcoin/blockchain in fiat doesn't want to be regulated but it will be if the government gets involved up to and including forks ...  


(2) or the government won't allow it

both work against long standing  bitcoin/blockchain aims.

moreover the fact that printing money can't be apart of bitcoin/blockchain (which means forking) ... is another reason bitcoin/blockchain is day dreaming. dealing with real, mature financial markets can't be reconciled to bc. bc isn't a currency in anyway that counts ... the fact there's some trivial retail of guys buying coffee etc. does not a fiat replacement make.

"You don’t understand how bans work. 

It isn’t about absolute prevention. Murder is illegal but there is no mechanism in place to stop you from murdering. Only consequences. 

The point of a ban is to raise the bar (via consequences ) so that it becomes unattractive for the vast majority of people who won’t consider breaking the law.
