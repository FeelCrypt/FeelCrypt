It also means crypto, or anything that uses huge amount of electricity from the grid, is a even bigger problem because if the supply is inefficient that's added onto the extra demand already being created.

Coins last a lot longer than paper currency. They also cost more to make, but in general, coins save energy. Setting aside the debate if inflation has rendered all coins useless because they have no value, if say we used coins instead of 1 5 and 10's, this would save a lot of energy, although we would also need to make some new coins, and real people would actually have to use them, instead of returning them to banks en mass, as we have done with the dollar coins, because fSk coins, they suck and are hard to handle...;1;0;False;triplewitching2;e7wxr9f;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png

I hope no-one tells these Chinese miners about Bitmain, man!

In other words, the calculation is wrong, and by quite a bit. We see miners flock to to colder regions and be profitable, even if prices they are paying are well above 4 cents.

I'm sure _someone_ in China is getting 3 cents or even less, I'm also skeptical a very large percentage of the network is on these prices, but if they are, they'll be making massive profits, not barely running even after power prices.";2;0;False;lllama;e7xak4g;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png

Yet not every mining operation that we hear about is in those places.

We hear about ""upstate New York"" all the time, but you're nor going to get down to 3 cent. We hear about Quebec which was around 5 cent. We hear about Iceland, where only Alcoa got that rate in the past (when buying half the islands power) , and that's now over for them too. 

So let's suppose somewhere in China there's someone getting a rate low enough to also pay for miners, cooling, warehousing, staff etc. Still does not make sense all these other people keep their equipment on if they're running at a loss just on electrical price alone. 

In fact, that difficulty keep rising despite violent prices swings strongly suggest a large majority of miners have a pretty wide margin, at least before sunk costs.

Bitfury does a lot of research with 2 Phase immersion cooling. Up to half of the power needed at large data centers is cooling. Immersion technology can reduce cooling energy usage by 97%. The internet uses a lot of energy and a 97% reduction in cooling power used would be massive.

*Unsheaths katana*

Seriously though, your misinterpreting that source a lot. 

#100% of electricity generated is *USED*. 


The phrase *rejected energy* dosent mean the electricity is generated and thrown away (also impossible), it means [the electricity was never generated in the first place](https://energycultures.org/2014/07/rejected-energy-much-energy-unloved/). Think of it as a efficency percentage. Like every normal car will make 500hp of energy, but only 150 of that is kinetic. It dosent mean the 350hp are somehow ""not used"" and thrown out the window, it's just heat and noise that isn't useful. Working on reducing this number is important but your not the first person to realise more efficient power generation is important.

Also like I said, it just highlights how important it is to reduce energy consumption. 

The problem is [crypo is already at 0.5%](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-mining-energy-use-electricity-cryptocurrency-a8353981.html). This is a massive number when you think on global scale. Then imagine how much it would use if everyone used crypto all the time, a market cap billions of times what it is now. Its not sustainable and someone needs to find a solution. 

If you really believe in crypto's mission you should highlight the importance of finding a solution for things like this instead of just trying to distract people by complaining about the laws of thermodynamics as if it was something created specifically to undermine it. Crypto has to work past this if it ever wants to achieve global adoption and by sweeping it under the rug your actively working against crypto's future.

">Yes this is a innate problem with electricity that's existed since the first wire and is physically impossible to solve completely.

Yes and no. You're right that it can't be solved completely, but we can do *VASTLY* better.

>It also means crypto, or anything that uses huge amount of electricity from the grid, is a even bigger problem because if the supply is inefficient that's added onto the extra demand already being created.

That's not exactly how it works. While energy lost in transmission is significant, much more energy is produced that consumed to ensure spikes in demand don't pull down the rest of the grid. 

Local generation and storage could solve quite a bit of that,  but we're decades away from the kind of adoption that would make a difference.

"1. Higher velocity (more transactions) doesn't necessarily mean higher price. In practice it often has, but this is due to increases in price leading (and likely *causing*) more transactions on the blockchain. These first years are weird and the price discovery phase is going to be different than the network in the future.

2. The mining reward is halving all the time...so the next halvening (and each subsequent one), the profit potential for miners to add hash power *decreases*...even though having fewer coins hit the market does tend to increase the price...it never doubles the price as far as we can tell (hard to pin causation, and these halvenings are completely predictable, thus largely priced-in over long periods of time)...so the likely net effect is that this will decrease the amount of energy expended, all other things equal.

3. ASICs are still getting more efficient over time...so as the above two things happen, this will ultimately create less use of energy on mining.

How often men are raped has nothing to do with how often women commit rape (I.e. it is usually other men raping men), and how much energy the bitcoin network uses is completely irrelevant to the question of whether that much energy usage is a good or bad thing...whether it is value-producing.

Nobody balks at all the energy which banks and electric cars use...because most people understand the value that these activities create.  Most people do not understand the value that bitcoin creates (and have even been propagandized to believe that it is a value-destroying activity)...and so they take any mention of some non-comparable stat like, how much energy bitcoin uses, compare it to a totally different thing, like electric cars, and then morons like you flood in here and ""guilelessly"" remind us of the technical truth of the completely worthless fact, that bitcoin uses more energy than all the electric vehicles in the world, and try to imply that we are being defensive for no reason.

Actually, it really is.

>As it stands now, bitcoin alone uses somewhere between 2.6GW and 7.7GW [0]. That is not an insignificant amount of power

Completely irrelevant. A lot of activities consume a lot of power. The only question is whether that energy use (costs) are value-generating for the users who pay those costs in order to attain the benefits, and that those users are bearing the costs more or less directly (I.e. not externalizing the costs on others or being subsidized).

The consumption of electricity of course externalizes some costs on others, mostly in the form of pollutions which are not priced in to the cost of electricity, and thus into consumption of mining resources and transaction fees. Also, some electricity is government subsidized.

All this implies, though, is that something like a Pigouvian tax needs to be used to internalize the pollution costs, and maybe governments need to not subsidize electricity to miners (this would actually improve mining decentralization...so in fact, Gov subsidies create a negative externality on bitcoin users).

And these externalities of course apply to **everything else** which uses electricity...so is not unique to bitcoin and thus not an argument against it.

Bitcoin mining is manifestly a value-producing activity.

>It is also a problem for the expansion of the network because at some point the cost of energy will be prohibitively expensive to add new mining resources.

Incorrect. That is not how any of this works. It's not how prices and subsequent econimizimg of resources works, and it's not how miners operate.

"I have a only a small portion of portfolio in btc for this reason. I don't want to support a crypto that doesn't have a plan to mitigate environmental impact. Difficultly doesn't have a cap so neither does energy usage. And it is *puposfully* security by resource usage. Logic leads me to believe that miners who reduce energy costs will increase their hash power proportionally to increase profits. At best energy usage is a wash, at worst those profits get reinvested and a mining operation can now stomach higher energy usage than before they adopted strategies to minimize it. It's probably a dumb move financially, but averting climate disaster is more valuable to me. 

Glad to hear some miners are conscious of this, but bc China is the majority of mining, and coal is still in large use there, I'm mostly out for now. :'(

The economics of mining do not work unless its mostly sunk cost. If a miner was able to sell some byproduct of mining that approached or equalled the cost of the electricity then their marginal cost of mining essentially becomes zero.

But I think you are pointing to an important issue: I saw some graphs for the coin distribution of NXT and Ardor and in both cases, some few persons were holding two thirds of the coins. Which also would be the killer state for a PoS Algorithm, I guess. But I have to admit I never investigated it further, just saw these figures.
