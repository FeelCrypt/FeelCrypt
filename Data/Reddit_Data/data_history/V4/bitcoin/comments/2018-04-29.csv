"K well I'm just generally a crypto skeptic. I feel like cryptos definitely have a use in society, and can do some really neat things, and the underlying blockchain technology is revolutionary. But I'm skeptical that any crypto of any kind would ever seriously compete with a government issued currency from a developed country. 

Sure it'll be a great alternative in countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela where their official currency is so fucked it's close to useless. 

But for the foreseeable future, it's not going to compete with the Dollar or the Euro or the Yen or even the Yuan. That's just my opinion. 
I don't give a shit whether it's Bcash or Bitcoin the original. These things have uses. But anyone saying they're going to replace normal currency I feel like is living a bit of a fantasy.

"Just because something had time and effort put into making it, doesn't mean it has value. 

Just because there's a limited quantity of something, doesn't mean it has value. 

Just because something is hard to counterfeit, doesn't mean it has value. 

I could work really hard on a shitty macaroni painting and it's virtually guaranteed to be worthless despite a lot of work going into it, it being rare, and extremely difficult for anyone to reproduce exactly. 

All those factors of rarity, ease of counterfeiting and cost to produce will affect the value if it has value. But none of them make it have value in the first place. 

Commodities that have intrinsic value through their use have already proven they aren't worthless. A bushel of corn can be eaten. A barrel of oil can be refined into various goods to be sold.

But a unit of a crypto currency or a normal fiat currency has no intrinsic value. You can't eat it. You can't do something to it to turn it into a good that can be sold. The only thing that makes it not worthless is that other people are willing to accept it in exchange for goods/services.

And the Dollar will always be accepted by the Federal Government for paying taxes even if it's not accepted anywhere else. There's no huge entity like that guaranteed to accept any crypto for the foreseeable future. Some individual companies might accept crypto but companies go in and out of existence on the regular.

**So tldr; the only thing that makes any fiat currency (including cryptos) worth more than 0, is the willingness of others to accept it in exchange for goods/services. Rarity, cost of production, and difficulty of counterfeiting affect its value but none of those things can make it worth more than zero by themselves.**";1;1;False;Frnklfrwsr;dy6872g;Value is always in the eyes of the beholder;8fmasd;https://i.redd.it/y6n54dyjfpu01.jpg

"The fact that Bitcoin is virtually immune to counterfeiting is a neat feature. But has close to nothing to do with intrinsic value of a currency. 

It is exceedingly difficult to counterfeit large quantities of any major currency. Maybe it's even harder to do with BitCoin but it hasn't become so massive a problem with traditional currencies that this is some huge differentiator. 

When people are criticizing the dollar and the federal reserve system, ""it's too easy to counterfeit"" is rarely an argument I've ever even seen attempted.

In the end, it's all fiat currency that only has value if there's someone else willing to give you a good or service in exchange for it.

And for BitCoin, there is no one entity out there that is guaranteed to always accept Bitcoin for goods and services. Some individual business may promise to do so, but businesses go bankrupt and cease to exist all the time. 

For the American Dollar, you can be certain there will always be one entity that will always accept the dollar. That is, the Federal Government. And since everyone has to pay taxes, and dollars is the only form of currency the IRS accepts, as long as the US exists and taxes exists you know for sure at least one very large entity will always accept dollars.

"Canine teeth or conch shells are not fiat money, they are commodity money. To have fiat money, money ""by decree,"" somebody has to decree that it's worth something. All fiat money in the world has some sort of entity, central bank or government, behind it. Check [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Definition):

Fiat money has been defined variously as:

* Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.

* State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.

* Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.

* An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange (also known as fiduciary money.)

United States v. Alcoa, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945), is a landmark decision concerning United States antitrust law. Judge Learned Hand's opinion is notable for its discussion of determining the relevant market for market share analysis and—more importantly—its discussion of the circumstances under which a monopoly is guilty of monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

"Utility is separate from value. Something can be intrinsically useful but not valued.

Oxygen is very useful to us human beings, but it is not valued. It is far too abundant to sustain a price. If you are under water and need an oxygen bottle to breath then it has tremendous value, but if you are on land in a clean country it is taken for granted and attributed no value becuase it is so abundant. 

In that sense utility, human desire and scarcity are what create value. Something doesnt just automatically have universal ""intrisic"" value because value is relative, all value is determined extrinsically. The term intrinsic value is a farce. Intrinsic utility is far more correct, and just beause something has intrinsic utility does not mean it will always be valued because of ""the paradox of value"".

also i don't find gold or crypto similar use cases.  gold in the current financial system is best thought of as insurance and the currency of last resort.  it is basically super cash accepted everywhere as a result of human and monetary history.  it is the super store of value and that's all it is supposed to do, retain purchasing power.

meanwhile crypto like bitcoin is intended to be currency and compete/displace fiat.  it's not meant to be used as this super insurance but meant to be used for buying and selling goods, as well as saving, and as a feature of being a currency also act as a store of value.

i don't understand the economics of some that claim store of value first, then currency, as i don't believe any currency has ever done this, nor does it make any economic sense this could/would happen nor is there a reason to treat or even invent crypto as just a store of value.  neither i think is anyone using it this way anyway - some people get into it to try and use it as a proper currency/spend/replace, others HODL/speculate until moon/lambo.  but stores of value do not speculate until lambo - they are not about gaining purchasing power, they are about *preserving* purchasing power.";1;1;False;igobyplane_com;dy5p5rq;Value is always in the eyes of the beholder;8fmasd;https://i.redd.it/y6n54dyjfpu01.jpg

"> And yet Proof of Work can be succeeded by Proof of Stake, which of course is said to be less secure, but doesn't need mining.

[No, it absolutely cannot.](https://blog.bitmex.com/complete-guide-to-proof-of-stake-ethereums-latest-proposal-vitalik-buterin-interview/).

>Therefore, we conclude, that the core characteristic of this latest Casper proposal is that the PoW happens first, and only after this does PoS potentially provide an extra assurance against a chain re-organisation, orchestrated deliberately by a hostile PoW miners. PoW therefore still provides computational convergence, with the PoS mechanism defending against the threat of a human threat of a miner re-organisation. Therefore although PoS provides this safety, as point three above indicates, it also provides extra risk, therefore its not clear if there is a net benefit.

You are sorely lacking education on the topic if you think PoS can exist without PoW. Why do you think that Ethereum has had so many issues implementing PoS? Their attempt at doing full PoS (2015) miserably failed and  they have kept PoW in (2018)because vitalik fully understands now that you **cannot** have a functional PoS *without some form of PoW implemented*.

PoS is *not* a magical bullet and never will be. Its trade-off's have only proven to lower the security of the network for some resource management.

If you want lower security then why don't you continue using paypal and fiat? The entire reason crypto was invented was to enable financial sovereignty. 

You cannot have financial sovereignty with a low-security PoS system.

"I know plenty about Bitcoin. That's why I hate it. I hate commodity currencies. I hate private currencies. The model for crypto is a choice between the two of them. Either you have flexibility controled by a private entity with incentives that generally dont line up with the needs of the users, or you have an inflexible commodity currency whose value is incredibly vulnerable to manipulation. 

We have thousands of years of development into currency systems. Crypto likes to pretend that it's the next evolutionary step in currency but the reality is it's simply a digital commodity using new versions of previous currency ideas, that rolls back on numerous improvments to currency and pretends its advancement. 

Crypto wants decentralization. 

Not recognizing that centralization is necessary for regulation and stability. 

Not realizing we have had decentralized commodity currencies in the past and they regularly destroyed economies overnight. 

Not realizing that their inherent technological model solves towards a mining monopoly.

Not realizing that they still create a private currency controled by an organization. 

Its a psuedo libertarian wet dream to have money without government. But the reality is governments only got into the money trade to stabilize it because it used to be a fucking shit show. 

Crypto wants to be considered a currency. 

Despite having a value that fluctuates so rapidly its nearly impossible to transact without change in value. 

Despite having base values that aren't feasible for transactions without ridiculous subdivisions based on fractions of value determined by the comparative price to a real currency. 

Despite horrendous transaction times, excessive power consumption, extremely complicated handling, ridiculously restrictive management, and a very unlikely chance of ever being supported by basic POS systems. 

Despite the fact that it will never be used to issue a loan by a bank because crypto is designed to hate banks. Which is important because fractional reserve banking is how currencies primarily increase their money supply without minting all of it. 

Crypto wants high value and rapid growth. 

Despite high value being purely in the interest of investors at the expense of its currency applicability. 

Despite literally no form of economics supporting the idea that an economy with a base value 900x higher than par is a good thing as opposed to a currency closer to par with more currency on circulation. 

Crypto is a commodity currency controlled by private ""Goldsmiths"" who benefit from having a stock tradable commodity rather than a currency. Crypto has no inherent use outside of being a currency. As such crypto becomes this hommonculus which pretends it has currency value so that it's trading doesn't tank but behind the scenes the crypto is attempting to increase trade value rather than actually make it a currency. 

This is digital gold without the real world uses for gold.

The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as ""a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses"". Experiments are a procedure designed to test hypotheses. Experiments are an important tool of the scientific method. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.

"**Negative interest on excess reserves**

Negative interest on excess reserves is an instrument of unconventional monetary policy applied by central banks to encourage lending by making it costly for commercial banks to hold their excess reserves at central banks so they will lend more readily to the private sector. Such policy is usually associated with very slow economic growth, deflation, and deleverage.

During economic downturns, central banks often lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Until recently, it was thought that rates couldn't go below zero because people would hold on to cash instead of paying a fee to deposit it.

"No it’d be like saying I understand how the body works but not how individual cells work, which is entirely possible. That’s why in economics we have two major divides.

The difference revolves around uncertainty and the economic principle of long run averages.

In developed economies the interest rates decline 'naturally' with shrinking high profit investments. make no mistake, there are still very profitable single investments to make, but we are looking at the macro level here. with an interest rate spiraling towards zero, one can at least make the thesis that fractional reserve has no positive effect anymore.;2;1;False;Hanspanzer;dy4x2qn;Value is always in the eyes of the beholder;8fmasd;https://i.redd.it/y6n54dyjfpu01.jpg

"I'm quite tired of hearing this stupidity. When discussing debt, the important number is debt as percentage of GDP; i.e. the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy. Here is a summary of the history of our debt-to-GDP while a fiat currency:

1968-1982 (14 years): We fully switch over to a fiat currency. Debt-to-GDP is ~40% and **declining** throughout this entire period.

1982-1994 (12 years): Reagan passes massive tax cuts and over this period the debt-to-GDP climbs from ~35% to ~65%.

1994-2008 (14 years): Clinton passes some tax raises smaller than the cuts Reagan handed out and over this period the debt-to-GDP is mostly flat.

2008-2012 (4 years): The Great Recession happens. Mass unemployment increases government spending, and decreases GDP growth. Debt-to-GDP increases from ~60% to ~100%.

2012-2017 (5 years): The world mostly recovers. Debt to-GDP over this period is mostly flat.

Of the 50 years we have spent on a fiat currency, 33 of those were spent with the problem under control.

Of the 65% increase in debt-as-GDP we've managed to accumulate over the past 50 years, 30% is the fault of Ronald Reagan and 35% is the fault of bipartisan banking deregulation which made what any sane person would call **criminal fraud** completely legal.

"Here's the reality. 

What you just said is tantamount to sacrelige.  

You are arguing against the criticism of ideas due to the absence of original thought. 

Aka. 

No peer review. 

Aka. 

No science. 

Ideas proposed need to be criticized freely without the need for alternative solutions. Otherwise no ideas can have its faults made apparent. 

You need to invent the internet to criticize phone lines, but you can't invent the internet if you don't know they problems with telecommunications. 

This isn't how criticism works. 

If an idea cannot withstand criticism it is the fault of the idea not the critic. 

To prevent criticism is to create propoganda and echo chambers. It is to deny the semblance of rational thought. 

If someone is going to stand on a soapbox and pretend Bitcoin isn't an archaic idea using modern technology then they deserve to have to answer to why they are pretending it isn't the case. If you want to claim the sky is orange you need to be able to be told is isn't. Otherwise you are a coward who is trying to be decietful. 

But let's pretend just for a second that we live in your magical world where criticism needs alternatives to exist. 

Blockchain technology is fundamentally one of the greatest accomplishments in computing science. The ability to have unreplicable digital tokens is something far beyond what we originally thought might ever be possible. 

The technology has only scratched the surface of its use. 

But nothing about crypto currency apart from blockchain is original. There are numerous criticisms of these types of currency schemes. To prophess their greatness in absence of these long standing criticisms is to be intentionally dishonest for your own purposes. 

You don't stiffle criticism you answer it. If you can't answer it you are wrong.  That's just how it works. If you lie be prepared to be called a liar. 

Crypto has fundamental problems that you can't ignore by lumping it together and calling unoriginal. If that's the case this entire sub is entirely void of original content by your standards and noone should be praising crypto.

Right, the Fed was around but had less control over inflation and the value of the dollar. Actually, the end of the gold standard was done less for long-term reasons and more in response to a short term crisis- the US had less gold reserves than the amount of dollars in foreign banks. There was a real worry that banks around the world would exchange their dollars for gold, and that the US would run out of gold to repay it with, crashing the US dollar.

"Go to Dubai and tell me how intrinsically valuable heat is.

Intrinsic value is a myth.

Value is a mechanism of attributing human desire to something. Like you said, it is humans who attribite value, not the item dictating it has value. Something only has value if it is desired or required. 

Now food, water, shelter and heat are useful, but value is determined separately from usefulness. Something can be useful but not desired or valued its all about perception.

Beef and vegetables are both food and useful to prevent starvation but beef has no value to a vegan.

Food and shelter are intrinsically usefull but value is relative. They are not the same thing.

Even gold. Gold is useful for some things but value is relative. There is nothing specific about gold itself that gives it value, it is however useful and usefulness can create human desire which creates value.

"This is one of the best comment threads I’ve ever read.

Not that my opinion carries any weight whatsoever but I think the core this conversation comes down to the fact that greed is currently the best way to organize / incentivize humans.

In the USA that’s why there are legitimate reasons to be liberal or conservative. Greed leads to prioritizing money making (even within governments) which also lead negative side effects (doctors being overpaid, unfair hiring practices, disproportionate salaries). The other end to that sword though is that greed is the only way we can all cooperate...

When you go to work and give up 8-14 hours a day you are doing it because of greed. Or at least a desire to not be poor (whatever you want to label that ). It’s through that though the companies can ultimately maximize their profits.

Bitcoin as a concept isn’t truly about financial freedom because the same greed applies. The greed has created this value BUT just like it does in capitalism, greed in crypto has many positive side effects in this case. 

***by the way I recognize that capitalism and crypto aren’t mutually exclusive***

Bitcoin allows for true free trade and true free enterprise. The biggest hurdle is/was awareness and adoption, the greed to make outsize gains will lead to awareness and adoption. Then we will all benefit ... not necessarily in a utopia creating kind of way but in a way that creates a lot of efficieny. Kinda like the internet... didn’t fix poverty but it damn sure made a lot of things more efficient. Hell the internet allowed for Bitcoin...

So during the bust tax and fiscal policy eventually adjusts to redistribute unused wealth to the benefit of the country. And things start going well again. After a few years everything is great and nobody seems to remember that the last time we took the brakes off of what essentially limitless capital could do it didn't turn out so well.

"The backing of a currency isn't the problem. Currencies can be backed by nothing and still exist as long as people agree they have value. 

The problem has never been ""is bitcoin valuable"". Bitcoins were fine when they were worth pennies. 

The problem is crypto currencies are a commodity currency fueled entirely by speculation. The real value in crypto is hoping it rises over time by magnitudes with little effort.

Which is fine for an investment. Its a stupid high risk one but it is an investment. 

The problem is currency wants to be stable, reliable, and steadily increasing marginally. Economies favour predictable currencies over erratic ones. 

And without a general AI with a complete world model manning the production of crypto the lever is either in the hands of an algorithm that can't be left alone to manage the coin or an organization that cant be considered objective in how they run the coin. 

At the end of the day crypto is not decentralized. Crypto still has a mint. The only thing is the process allows independent mints to form they just become part of a pool of minters. The mint will still decide how much currency exists. 

And because of how the economics of mining works, you will get a centralized private mint. 

Currencies need less and less printing done as time goes on. In some cases they diminish currency before going back to minting surplus. That's the nature of economies. They don't scale linearly over long periods of time. 

As such mining needs to get more expensive to accomplish over time. Which reduces the margins of the coin. As this process repeats more and more miners are knocked off as their scale is no longer economically viable. Eventually one firm mints all the coin in the currency and noone can touch them. The economy eventually reaches a stasis where the numbers are kept just above what would shutter the Minter but not too much as more would kill the economy. 

To do anything else would flood the economy with too much currency and devalue and crash it. 

Again. Speculation is what drives value here. Not use as an exchange. So if it stops being a good investment they VC pulls out. 

Eventually when the system weeds out all but one minter you reach the problem. 

Your decentralized currency consists of two entities. An organization to determine how much coin is needed. And an organization that will mint as much coin as said org allows. 

""Decentralized""

The technology is amazing.

"You act as if shit hits the fan over night...There would be a period of time, perhaps quite a long period, where the USD/fiat will be spiralling out of control and all your fiat savings will become essentially worthless, but gold will be worth A LOT (though in nominal terms it will be worth about the same as it is today in terms of buying power, maybe a little bit more though because people will view it as a store of value during this period). Now, it is during this period that the gold stackers will use up most of their gold, prepping for the eventual collapse they know is coming, buying food and water and supplies with their actual life savings that have stored its value, whilst fiat only folks will have literally nothing with which to do this with. Look to contemporary Venezuela for an example of how a gold stacker there, right now, would be living a considerably easier life than their neighbours right now, especially if they were wise and only trading in the gold for fiat as they need it. Possibly stocking up as well at this point would be wise as that place is a disaster, and probably only going to get worse in the coming months/years, I think I'd have stocked up on supplies months ago though frankly, things are really, really bad there.

If shit hit the fan as badly as you outlined though, you'd be a hell of a lot better off with gold, than with crypto currency you can't even buy that many goods and services with right now, and when things get really, really bad you wouldn't even be able to access crypto if/when there is no electricity. Sure, when there's looting and chaos the gold will be worthless, it may even be a liable for someone trying to loot it off of you. But once the pieces are slowly being picked back up again, you know gold will be THE currency of choice yet again. It is why many people who stack gold also stack a decent amount of food and water, and as I said earlier, will stack even more food and water in the weeks before the chaos ensues. But keeping some gold as well for a post-chaos world when things are getting back together slowly.

If you're really expecting complete societal collapse, gold makes perfect sense. A store of value for the early days of the collapse when inflation is running out of control, so you can stock up on the things you'll need to get through the chaos, and keep some of the gold for when things are getting back to normal. Bitcoin on the other hand, I see less value in. It will probably get propped up by hyper inflation, just like every single other asset class, I just find it hard to believe people will be willing to throw so much into something which will be 100% inaccessible in a no internet and/or no electricity era, something that takes days/weeks to convert to fiat in order to buy the goods and services in the earlier days of the inflationary period, such that by the time you actually get your fiat to buy goods and services it is worth far less than when you sold the Bitcoin. And assumes your bank doesn't fail in the interim period.

The only scenario for BTC as a store of wealth in a collapsed society is some weird semi-collapse where electricity and internet are still readily accessible by all and BTC has already reached a stage where it is accepted everywhere. Under that scenario it will be a useful item in a collapsing society. Until that's true, I'll stick primarily to gold/silver for my doomsday prepping, and my cryptos to make money day trading the amazing volatility.";3;3;False;vortex30;dy53kc3;Value is always in the eyes of the beholder;8fmasd;https://i.redd.it/y6n54dyjfpu01.jpg

"Let's look at 2 situations here.

First, I open an account at a bank that's been around for quite some time. It's well known, but they are not keeping up with the changes in the financial system as well as some other banks. Their services still work, but due to technical disadvantages, anytime I want to transact using the money I have in that bank, I have to wait 10 minutes or more for my transaction to be approved. On top of that, every time I want to purchase something, even something as small as a cup of coffee or a candy bar from my local store, I get charged ""service fees"" that can increase exponentially depending on how many others are trying to transact at the same time. These service fees cost just as much as my candy bar, sometimes even more. Sure the bank has been around awhile, but because it's not willing to make the changes necessary to speed up transaction times and lower service fees, it becomes a pain trying to use the money I have in that account on a day-to-day basis.

Upon seeing this disadvantages and how they affect the consumers using these financial services, a few of the guys leave their old jobs at the first bank and decide to start a new one. This new bank allows for quicker transaction times, due to using better technology, and on top of it, the service fees are a lot more acceptable. Now my candy bar isn't doubling in cost and I can live with the penny or two that the new bank charges me to transact. Sure, this new bank hasn't been around for quite as long, but the guys that started it were active and well known at the old bank and saw the opportunity to make something more functional. Something that's not resistant to change. Something that stays true to what a bank should be - an institution that allows for the transfer of money in the fast digital world of commerce.

Sure, my grandparents still use the old bank because that's what they are more familiar with. They think that the new bank alienates consumers because in their eyes, the old system wasn't broken per se, just not as convenient for the consumer. But while they wait for their purchases to confirm and lose more and more of their hard earned money to service fees, a growing population of consumers is seeing that the new bank might actually be on to something here.

Tell me, are you stuck with the grandparents, or are you financially aware of the changes that need to take place in order to keep up with growing consumption?";1;0;False;crypto93299;dy554qq;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg

"So like, there was obvious ""contention"" over integrating SegWit. They put it in the reference client (the only one that matters) anyway, as a so-called ""soft fork"". Once the first block was mined with a SegWit transaction in it the blockchain was permanently changed to be a SegWit-compatible blockchain. It's not the same thing any more.

I think it's disingenuous, or maybe just ignorant, to say that one fork was contentious but the other wasn't. One was clandestine and one was overt, is more how I would put it. The BCH fork had to happen when it did because the SegWit change was about to be ""soft-forked"" into the blockchain with no alternative, it was a forced fork with no alternate fork. Miners could vote beforehand and they did, but after SegWit happened there *was* no alternate chain for miners to actually vote with their computing power. Except there was, it was called BCH.

So really these are the two forks of that *contentious* SegWit fork. IMO it is yet to be seen which fork won. BTC is and has been winning but the gap is closing.";1;1;False;sou-ght;dy64996;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg

Not sure why this debate continues to ramble on. Time to just accept the nature of the situation and refer to it as something other than ""Bitcoin"". ";1;1;False;gypsytoy;dy61ql8;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg
"Where do you see BCH topping out in terms of global adoption? Once fees are cheap and blocks are huge, what's to limit spam from creeping up, causing fees to rise once again? This is the perpetual spam problem.

Seriously though, have you crunched the numbers on what on-chain scaling looks like for the number of transactions that occur on other payment networks? It's not pretty.";2;0;False;gypsytoy;dy61aqx;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg

"You're right, Sw2x was just one of many attacks from the ""big block"" camp. I'll summarize how for any newcomers who read this.

Small blocks are a security parameter set by Satoshi Nakamoto. Small blocks protect Bitcoin in a few ways, all of them related to decentralization. Decentralization is why Bittorrent is alive and well, while centralized Napster was dismantled long ago. Decentralization is crucial to prevent minority interests (such as a government or mining cartel) from hijacking the public utility protocol and changing it to suit their own interests. This decentralization is fostered by small blocks firstly by making resources on the blockchain scarce. Resource scarcity means spammers cannot stuff blocks full of economically meaningless transactions for *free*. The anti-bloat objective is to *minimize the discouragement* that ordinary people using ordinary computers may face when running fully validating nodes, since those need to store the entire block chain. It's not only storage, it's also bandwidth which is an economic burden which some people cannot afford, and latency. Latency is the time a node needs to validate the contents of a block before it propagates it to the rest of the network. Bigger blocks increase the amount of data being validated every 10 minutes which increases latency, which favors larger mining pools who find blocks (and collect block rewards and tx fees) more often than small pools. Because the mining pool which found a block can start searching for the next block while nodes are still validating and propagating a block recently found, and because large blocks increase latency, larger pools gain an additional advantage over smaller rivals, again reducing decentralization and encouraging centralization. Thus both nodes and miners are faced with a centralizing pressure when blocks size is increased.

One of the ways decentralization protects network participants is by increasing the requirements for consensus. Consensus means broad agreement about implementing proposed changes. A centralized authority can make changes which are self-serving, while a system which requires consensus from a decentralized group is more aligned with the interests of the many. 

Decentralization is therefore defense. It's always better to overshoot security than undershoot it. The reason security matters so much is that as a disruptive technology, which challenges the most powerful institutions man has ever built, it has powerful and indefatigable enemies. Enemies which will do everything they can to delay or destroy the threat to themselves.  

The big block camp would trade security for lower fees, hoping it encourages adoption, which would help them ""get rich quick""-er. That's understandable. However simply increasing the block size as they'd like requires a hard fork to the consensus rules, BCH is such an example. As predicted such a controversial hard fork created a chain split because it lacked consensus. A chain split will always splinter and divide the community and it's not hard to see that the enemies of bitcoin have been highly motivated to encourage such a hard fork to Bitcoin for a long time. The enemies of Bitcoin have been fanning this block size controversy all along, HKA, BU, XT, NYA & SW2X are all battles they lost.          

Not everyone who wanted such a hard fork is an enemy of bitcoin, but every enemy of bitcoin wanted such a hard fork and an unknown proportion of people who support BCH are such enemies, not all but some. Maintaining consensus, evolving the software with the will of the entire decentralized network can be difficult and frustrating but it's a feature not a bug.

technically you are right. practically, not including segwit transaction despite a tx fee incentive only makes economical sense if miner uses asicboost.

">via UASF?

Yes.

>And who provides the initially important SHA256 to push through the transition to SHA3?

You don't need miners to ""push through"" a transition to SHA3. You ""just"" [\*] reach consensus on a new rule and upgrade the economic majority to enforce it. An economic majority can form without miners' cooperation.
