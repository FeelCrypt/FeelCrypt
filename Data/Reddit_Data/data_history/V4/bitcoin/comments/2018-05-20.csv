"this is could something ... the date 2002/08/01 is relevant for this paper: [http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf)

The reason I think that either this paper, or the date is important is a massive stretch, but the name of the image file is g4rbvtbiwry01.PNG \- g4rbvtbiwry01 is 12 letters \(if we count 01 as one letter\), which could correlate to a series of seed words.

If i take the most common bip39 seed words in the whitepaper starting with each letter, there is only one word starting with the letter 'y', which is year.

Also, the 01 in the img name correlates to the date of this paper. Almost definitely a coincidence, but could be somewhere near the solution.

**A completely different approach I have been trying:**

I've also been trying to brute force the 12 seed words by using all the words starting with g, a \(which looks like a 4\) or all the words near the 4 in the image, r, b, v, t, b, i , w, r, y, and all the words near the 01 in the image, but I suck at programming so don't know how to do that haha.

I got an empty wallet off of a combination with the cluster of words to left that starts with Credit, and includes Tree, Network, Play. Not much luck with similar clusters. I hit a wall.

"I haven't spent too much time on this, a couple of hours tops but here are my thoughts:

It doesn't really matter what's in the white paper. The concept is that the receiver of this piece of art should be able to find the answer without references.

So far the clues say think in pairs and we got a half of each pair:

Code
Easily
Attack
Early
Almost
Open

Each one is a word from BIP39 and each is from the white circle. We can find pairs for each and should solve it. I can't do this now as I'm doing it on my phone but focus on BIP39 words that are in the white circle and are BIP39 and possibly found on the canvas once

For example ""attack"" is inside a C so it's pair could be too, such as ""data""

Another option is that pair words are outside the circle.

Here's an image: [https://imgur.com/a/eP3Kuar](https://imgur.com/a/eP3Kuar)

1\) I think first clue clearly tell us that what we are looking for is a series of bip39 words, this statement gets stronger if we consider the fact the one user arised the hypothesis that the last answer on this post on stack exchange [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/68605/how\-to\-generate\-a\-valid\-hash\-for\-a\-bip39\-seed\-phrase](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/68605/how-to-generate-a-valid-hash-for-a-bip39-seed-phrase) is by the same guy who posted the riddle, and in the answer he quotes bip39.

2\)Honestly I have no clue on what this means, maybe we should look at similar words ""transaction"" and ""transactions"", or maybe the position as ""attack"" and ""data"" both inside a ""c""

3\), 4\), 6\) & 7\) Are all words I marked in the image

5\) 00212121 was given as an answer where an user asked something about 20020801 as this is not directly quoted in the white paper \(but is the hash\-cash paper publication date, that is indeed referenced\). A guy hypothesis is that the fact that the two 0s are the beginning indicate the fact the we should reverse the number thus becoming 12121200, is we consider it to be in a ternary system and we convert it to binary we get 111111111111, twelve ones. This could mean we need to look for 12 words. But this is not related to 20020801 so to me doesn't make any sense, but was the best idea i found.

Nope, you need to scroll down, select the bip49 tab then scroll down to the derived address list, if you have the right see the address of the current bounty should be listed there and you would use the private key to swipe the content of the wallet into your wallet.;1;0;False;P00r;dzap6xr;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

The sad fact is I've spent my entire day trying to get this one bitcoin and have gotten absolutely no where. I'm pretty sure it has to do with rotating the image but this has gone from entertaining and challenging to depressing and desperate. If I could put the same amount of effort into finding a job...

"8 hours of \(fun time \(!\) and finally learning some crypto libraries like the python reference implementation of BIP39 and the electrum libraries: Thanks to OP for giving an incentive to move those up on my ""want to learn list""\) yesterday. 

Here a summary of what doesn't work \(I might actually be willing to team up and share my source code on github if people wanna jump in \(e.g. u/thegreatmuffin what about u?\):

I spotted 18 words from the BIP39 list that have an intersection with the orange B \(actually 16 \+ the numbers 3 and 12 which I converted to the words three and twelve\) I looked up the word order of first apearances of those 18 words in the paper \(excluding multiple occurences\). However the checksum of the last word doesn't come up. 

So I took every subset of 12 and 15 words \(respecting the order\) where the checksum for a BIP39 seed summed up. Those where 1214 seeds. none of which produced the address that was provided.

"Well, maybe we can social engineer the solution or find some clues. 

Looking at the inner white circle, the words ""(see) block chain transaction"" kinda stick out due to their huge font size (additionally there is an arrow ""<="" pointing at ""chain"")

[Clue #2](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dz91gb5/) and the word combinations ""hashing earlier"" and ""creator checks"" brought me to the idea to check Stackexchange.

Interestingly, there is this question that was asked 4 months ago,
[How to generate a valid hash for a bip39 seed phrase?](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/68605/how-to-generate-a-valid-hash-for-a-bip39-seed-phrase). It already had some helping answers previously, but there was another one that was posted 26 hours ago (2 hours prior the initial transaction of 1BTC to the bounty address). I mean who knows, maybe the author was looking for ways to conceal the answer and wanted to help out the community at the same time.

Furthermore, if you check the authors profile on Stackexchange, you will notice that his avatar is some acryl painting suggesting that this guy is into arts. Now this might be a relevant clue due to the fact that www.cryptogreetings.com <-> /u/cryptogreetings , is very related to arts. What also caught my eye was the fact that this guy edited his answer two times during the last 22 hours despite the fact that this question is about 4 months old and was previously answered. It is also mentionable that he has some serious knowledge in terms of crypto [and especially crypto wallets](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/users/10377/skaht?tab=answers&sort=newest), and here you have to remember that someone who invents these riddles knows exactly what and how he is doing it.

If you look further into [this answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/75314), you can see that the author is emphasizing the utilization of ""Bitcoin explorer's (subcommand mnemonic-new)"" which correlates with the subliminal message ""(see) block chain transaction"" from the given picture. 

Now from this point, there could be two (or maybe more) approaches regarding the clue ""hashing earlier"" (Haven't tried to check these yet):

1. A combination of BIP39 words could be hashed into a Base16 string that is evenly divisble by 32 bits (requirement for bx mnemonic new) and then be used to create a BIP39 seed (for the bounty address)

2. Or you could **somehow** derive a Base16 string from the picture, with the same criteria as mentioned above which could also be used to create a BIP39 seed through (bx mnemonic-new)

Another random thought I came up due to [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dz99det/) (maybe another clue?), was to check the hex address @00212121 of the original picture, take the next 32 bytes beginning from 00212121&00212120 and use them to create 2 BIP39 seeds. But both of them lead to empty addresses.

Maybe this is way too much overthinking, but it never hurts to try unorthodox approaches.

"GUYS, i think i've found a way. Look, original clues should be treated like markers - there were 6 clues:

* Think in pairs
* Code easily, attack early
* Lost transaction costs almost users
* 00212121
* Try +1
* Almost open

Each clue is drawen somehow in the puzzle. For example ""Try +1"" is clearly seen at the picture between words ""block"" and ""chain"". ""Code easily, atack early"" - also at those picture region (i have not found the word easily).

So, i suppose this clues should be found on the picture and geometrically ""clues"" (like ""Try +1"" possibly point to words or word ""block"" and ""chain"") points to some words.

There are 6 clues - each may point to one or two words. We should find the clues on the picture, understood which words they point and try these words in order of clues. 

Thats all, in my langugae there is such proverb: ""When the finger points to the sky - only a fool looks at the finger""

Please, dont forget about me :)))

"[Another Python script](https://gist.github.com/kenprice/1a3c5009f5fdd8c801bba6620b779307).

This one takes a list of seed phrases (e.g. ""problem proof attack end ability find sign post know fee entire since"") delimited by a new line, and it generates BIP 49 addresses with the derivation path `m/49'/0'/0'/0/x`. Change `MAX_ADDR_IDX` to change the last digit of the derivation path `m/49'/0'/0'/0/x`. The script will check all of such x up to `MAX_ADDR_IDX`. Defaults to 0 only (`m/49'/0'/0'/0/0`).

If you want to test your best, educated guesses and have less than a thousand candidates, you may want to change `MAX_ADDR_IDX` to a larger number. Maybe 25? 256? But if you assume the key was generated using default parameters and you're employing a spray-and-pray technique (good luck), just leave it alone.

When found, it writes the seed phrase and BTC private key to `found.txt`.

Edit: This script assumes no additional passphrases were used. Boy, wouldn't that be a PITA? It's possible that a passphrase is used. It's also possible that this whole thing is a hoax. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

"A different point of view:

I'm a photographer so I work with digital photos often and it strikes me that the ""black"" background is not black.

Every color has a hex code and this particular color is:191a19 

The ""yellow"" color's hex code is: f2921d

The white is just white: ffffff

There are also RGB numbers associated with these colors.

I don't know enough about crypto to use these two six digit (or one 12 digit) codes for anything.

"I've run out of time. But I'd like to share my last theory based on the clues.

The numbers and equations are a distraction. It's a process of deduction. Remove everything that isn't the Mnemonic based on clues.

There are 12 pairs of words that linguistically ""match"" making 24 total. Their order is determined by the 12 numbers in the coin and words that intersect those numbers when you draw a line. Couldn't find 10 but went with it anyway. 

After coloring the only eligible words green (blue inside the BTC symbol) I started by drawing lines through the words in the clues provided. I ignored the blue words inside the BTC because none of the three clues had any words inside the BTC.

CODE EASILY ----> 1 (big number one)
ATTACK EARLY -----> 2 (happens to go through no.2)
ALMOST OPEN ----> 9 (line throug 9...coincidence?)

After drawing lines through the words in green to find corresponding numbers sticking strictly to those rules I ended up with something like this...(note 8, 12 were interchangeable - and 10 was nowhere to be found so I guessed with remaining words) Remember think in ""pairs"".

1 - code easily
2 - attack early
3 - agree online (consensus?)
4 - just rely 
5 - post sign
6 - pool risk
7 - cash gap
8 - old law
9 - almost open
10 - find air (lol - there's no 10!)
11 - modify course
12 - want end (end want lol)

All those words are eligible and go through those corresponding numbers which I assumed were the order.
If anyone plugs these pairs into their python script and solves it, or just solves it based on 90% of the work I've done for you, I'd settle for 50% of the prize :).

"Your cryptographic method is slightly off. Here is what could be done:

OP writes a text file of instructions on how to decrypt the image. That file is then hashed, and the hash output is posted publicly. 

Using the privkey of the btc address encoded into the picture, OP could then sign a message that reads “I control the private key of address -ADDRESS-,here is the hash of the instructions to decipher the image -HASH-”

This would allow others to immediately verify that OP controls the address. And then once the funds have been claimed, OP could post the text file to prove the puzzle was authentic (as anyone could hash it to verify it matches the hash OP posted earlier). 

Note that OP could still claim the funds themselves, my method would not stop them rigging the puzzle in that way.

I'm wondering if we can generate the exact same image as the puzzle, so we can compare what has been added manually etc. But I can't seem to create it to have words in the same places. I used 500 as the number of words and the rest I left at default.

And the whole rectangle would be filled, while here we have an empty space in the top right, as if one big word was deleted.

But brainwallet.github.io is correct and I verified your signature for your specific message ""This is real."" , here: https://jhoenicke.github.io/brainwallet.github.io/#verify?vrAddr=3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8&vrMsg=This%20is%20real.&vrSig=JBVR6xgey1k80FJlaBP1XyddQK%2Fvwc%2BPOFT9s9g583hfGUhFm2yEtns4lq3j%2BTskS3qEgqcZGeZYC%2BOGvqTmxA4%3D  
And since you wrote the **final clue** is this **really final** ? Or will you give more hints if this puzzle goes **unsolved for 1 month or so**? The only clue I found **totally absurd** is the 00212121 because there is not  a single 21 in the Satoshi paper. These numbers smell ternary (base 3) to me, but even so, in https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/convert-base.php this sequence converts to 637 in base 10, and its ""binary to ascii"" output still yields something nonsensical. Maybe they are some color or vector coordinates, but these numbers seem totally unrelated to the seed words, but OK I get it that you want this riddle to be hard as possible. You may lose gifting a few little  cryptomoney here, but you gain lots of marketing and attention, so it's it's a cunning trick you pulled with that **word cloud**. Honestly, I hope someone solves it already so I can move on to other puzzles.";0;2;False;migmxke;dzaf14b;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

"Some thoughts:

There appears to be three layers of words. 

The background layer is the black background with yellow lettering.

The middle layer is the white lettering.

The top layer is the Bitcoin logo with yellow lettering.

Could have something to do with the sequences of words being input into a seed. If you write out a 24 word seed into three rows, that would give you 8 words per row (possible 8 seed words per layer.)

Maybe the seed words are ones that begin in one layer and cross over to another layer.  ";1;0;False;itsmeclooney;dza90eq;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

Those code already tuned to the given problem. It consumes file 'addresses.txt' that should contain all BIP39 seeds - each line is 12 BIP39 words. So the main problem is to prepare this 'addresses.txt' (for example all possible permutations of some given here (i mean in Reddit) words). Then just run the script. But, if you will try to compose 'addresses.txt' with full set of, for example, 12 words permutations it would contain 12! lines ~ 30 Gb of memory (depends on words length). So it is a bit tricky. More over it will take a lots of time to brute force all these permutations (in order of ten's of days - decades i mean, sorry for my english, i am not native speaker);1;1;False;Student_in_charge;dza131p;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"You can't just create a random list of 24 words from the dictionary, because the BIP-39 phrase has a checksum. If you pick words at random, the checksum will never match the hash of the entropy. Basically, the last word can never be manually chosen because 8 bits of it are created from a truncated SHA256 of the all of previous words and 3 bits of the last word.

"You are arguing semantics. 

When the supply of money is increased, people have more money to offer for goods. If the supply of goods does not increase — or does not increase as much as the supply of money — then the prices of goods will go up. Each individual dollar becomes less valuable because there are more dollars. Therefore more of them will be offered against, say, a pair of shoes or a hundred bushels of wheat than before. A ""price"" is an exchange ratio between a dollar and a unit of goods. When people have more dollars, they value each dollar less. Goods then rise in price, not because goods are scarcer than before, but because dollars are more abundant.

When average normal  people deposit money in a savings account, they need to feel they can trust the bank to use it responsibly, while at the same time people who need to borrow need to be able to do so at reasonable rates. When smart contracts default, who covers the loss? Who makes sure depositors can still withdraw their funds (BTC or whatever) when some underlying debtors have disappeared ? When are crypto zealots going to realise that normal people just want a stable currency, can borrow when they need to, are protected from scammers and don't need a degree in CompSci to understand how to keep their money safe from hackers?

"Indeed. He's Swedish and ""varg"" is wolf in Swedish. I assume ""warg"" is an older spelling of varg. The W-letter is called double-v in Swedish, not double-u as in English. So many older spellings that earlier had w in them and is now spelled with v. In Norse mythology a warg is a mythological wolfe. E.g. the [Fenrir wolf aka Fenrir warg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir). 

His other last name, Svartholm, translates to something like Black-islet.
