"I'm struggling to understand what you're trying to say here. This ceteris paribus, i.e all things being equal. Land tax is usually percentage of value. Comparing different rates doesn't make LVT any less progressive. The people with higher values are still paying more tax. Most countries also have partial or even full exemptions for primary residences, or only have the tax come into effect past a certain valuation.

At the end of your massive paragraph you're not even talking about land tax, but other property taxes. The beauty of land tax is is that it cannot be passed on to tenants! 

>Because the supply of land is essentially fixed, land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on landlord expenses, preventing landlords from passing LVT to tenants.

>The direct beneficiaries of incremental improvements to the area surrounding a site are the land's occupants. Such improvements shift tenants' demand curve to the right. Landlords benefit from price competition among tenants; the only direct effect of LVT in this case is to reduce the amount of socially generated benefit that is privately captured (as an increase in the land price).

>LVT is said to be justified for economic reasons because it does not deter production, distort markets, or otherwise create deadweight loss. Land value tax can even have negative deadweight loss (social benefits), particularly when land use improves.

Most people would propose the land tax is a federal tax which avoids the whole rich neighbourhood paying less. Also it can't just be passed on to the tenant as the landlord has to pay it regardless. And sure it is a problem for people buying houses with mortgages however stamp duty is generally worse for those people as they may not be able to hold on to the property as long as others. ;5;2;False;w2qw;djz3n21;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg

Say I have a reasonably nice watch. I can sell that watch for 0.25 btc independent of bitcoin's value relative to other currency, and independent of government backing.

"**History of the board game Monopoly**

The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century. The earliest known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land.

"**Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act**

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.L. 111–203, H.R. 4173, commonly referred to as Dodd–Frank) was signed into federal law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression. It made changes in the American financial regulatory environment that affected all federal financial regulatory agencies and almost every part of the nation's financial services industry.

The law was initially proposed by the Obama administration in June 2009, when the White House sent a series of proposed bills to Congress.

"> Rent prices in real life is about supply and demand.

It should be, but actually is not always like that.

People are notoriously bad at thinking in the long term, and don't realize their property value is going to go down to 0 at some point, when the building becomes finally condemned. People are even worse at estimating how long will it take for that to happen, and how much will it cost to maintain it in a habitable state before that.

This leads to some owners asking for rents much higher than anyone is willing to pay, even if the property ends up unoccupied and they end up losing money on it.";6;2;False;jarfil;djyzjau;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg
"I found this quite interesting so I add what I learned :) 

Actually this is one of the few market segments that work very little like that. The natural very limited availability of space make the property to one of the most inelastic goods (change of demand is only weakly connected to a change of supply). That and other reasons makes real estate a kind of natural monopol. 

So in the end you cannot build infinite amount of real estate and hope that that drives the prices down. Therefore the regulation is necessary and like you can see some attempts work better than others depending on where you life... 

The easiest way is to build social housing (governmental or for example large investors need to keep a certain percentage of the area within the cities demands instead of speculating ), preventing empty flats, regulations,... 

Measuring the success of this, all large European cites pretty much fail, only Vienna is to some extent good at retaining a good balance. Another example is Singapor, where the space is so ultra limited and there is a great accumulation of financial capital. There you can only by a housing for ~ 90yrs before it goes back to the state (enough for three generations). This is one of the attempts to prevent the youth from emigrating while allowing them to buy housing and start a family and work in Singapore, which the city in the long term depends on. 

Annother segment with similar behavior is energy (natural market entry obstacles) , however this has opened up to a certain degree due to renewable energies... ";1;1;False;geppetto123;djz7k4m;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg
