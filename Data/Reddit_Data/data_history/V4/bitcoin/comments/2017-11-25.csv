Large transfers do not imply trafficking. It's not worth infringing on innocent people's right to privacy to catch a criminal.

">	Large transfers do not imply trafficking. It’s not worth infringing on innocent people’s right to privacy to catch a criminal.

Oh so it’s not worth having security cameras? It’s not worth having metal detectors at airports? It’s not worth having NSA/CIA monitor chatter or internet traffic for terrorist command, child porn rings etc. You obviously have no clue how much privacy is already traded for security, money is just one of the most basic ones.

>	Except almost all money transfer is digital now, so we can easily pay that much in one go. We don't force people to scan their debit cards in increments of $100 to stop traffickers.

Yes money is digital now, easier to track. I said they don’t have big notes because you want to avoid untraceable large transfers, not being able to do it with notes means they have to do it digitally which means it easier to track. That’s the whole point mate.

>	The rich huh? Heaven forbid we make sure everybody pays taxes. Though I guess you're right, since the rich are pretty much the only ones who are required to pay any taxes at all anymore.

I used the rich as an example, it’s not the poor guy with the minimum wage job that is going to receive massive payments on bitcoin and buy property or land with it. Who is avoiding taxes now using offshore havens etc? It’s not the poor.

I got sick (cold) right after, and my edema (swollen ankles) was problematic and liver levels were spiking. I stopped working out for a few months and lost 10 lbs.

"So I’m into lifting and bodybuilding, for fun not to compete or anything, and so I have helped a lot of friends over the years with lifting and gaining weight. I would say the number is well over a dozen with about 8 people or so sticking with it. Every single person who identified as you do, able to eat a ton of food and not gain weight, severely overestimated the calories they were actually consuming within a week(Body changes happen slowly so it’s more productive to thinks in terms of a week and not just a day) The variance of metabolic rate is relatively small and falls in line around 200 kcals a day. There are some extremes but I believe it’s only around 600 calories. Which is a lot I admit, but not if your intelligently attempting to gain weight. One would find out rather quickly they need to up their calories. So there really aren’t all these skinny people running around eating 4k cals a day. 


I find that Most people that identify like yourself tend to eat very large meals on a regular basis, at least every other day, but have very long periods of not eating because of that. That’s the same thing as eating two moderate meals though so it’s not affecting much of anything. Because these people generally are able to eat large amounts in one sitting, something I can’t do but I am eating over 4K clean calories a day right now, they feel like they consume a lot more calories then they actually do. Once I get them drinking a 1k+ calorie shake in the morning upon waking and at night before bed, plus all their other meals, they then realize they didn’t actually eat that much. I hope that helps you as you said your drinking weight gainer shakes so I presume you’re trying to gain weight. Track everything you eat for a week and I bet you will be surprised of the number. 


Lastly, on the off chance you’re buying a weight gainer product save your money and try- 2 cups whole milk, 1.5 cups dry oatmeal, 2 scoops whey(optimum nutrition is fantastic from a gram of protein per $ and vanilla is great in this) 2 tbsp chia seeds, and a half cup of frozen blueberries or equivalent. This is about 1150 calories, 85 protein, 110 carbs, and 35 grams fat. If the volume is to much you can add some fat like coconut oil and cut the quantities of of milk/oatmeal or just throw the fat in anyway. Chocolate whey with peanut butter is another good option. Just blend all that shit and drink it quickly or else it will hard to finish but you get used to it quickly. Another thing I eat, but really shouldn’t as the negative health effects of dairy are very well documented, is 2 cups whole fat plain Greek yogurt, 1 cup of the most calorie dense granola you can find( I use wegmans brand that is 140 cals per 1/4 cup, honey to taste, and some berries. That’s also right around 1100 calories and is god damn delicious.

Hmm. I’m the same except for the fact that if I REALLY want to gain weight I can. So can you. You’re definitely not eating as much as you think.

I have hired coaches, tracked every gram of food including macros, gone up to as high as 5k calories a day when I have a desk job and then just the gym 4x a week, dedicated 9 hours a night to sleep, pushed myself very hard in the gym and consumed a lot of literature on programming and strength programming in particular and have very little to show for it. 


The feeling of everyone discounting you is horrible and infuriating. That said, genetic potential for strength is vastly different than a metabolism that high. I have tried to do some research but it’s a very niche case so I haven’t had much luck. I will continue looking and hopefully I can share some literature with you that sheds light on the situation for both of us. It is very intriguing to say the least.

"And I’m saying it’s fine. Fat itself is not unhealthy.

I’ll qualify that.
Everyone carries fat to a degree. Our bodies are designed to eke out whatever fat it can and store it. Doing that is abnormal function. Bodies that don’t do it very well are less healthy than bodies that do (my gfs family), and that leads to further health issues. Fat is not just an energy store, its also a store of trace elements, vitamins etc and provides them to the body when out-of-season nutrients are no longer in the diet.
Fat is the bodies pagefile/swap drive. 

In excess fat can be bad. I’m partially subscribed to the cholesterol/heart attack thing but I think there are other more important influences than fat. Stress is a good example.

Fat in excess to the point where you can’t touch your toes, run 100yds, [become one with the sofa](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1371640/Morbidly-obese-man-fused-chair-sat-years-dies-hospital.html) or can’t function as a normal human being, I’d agree with you, that’s not healthy. A lifestyle change is needed.

I really want to get people away from the whole “All fat is bad” thing because that’s really not the case. It’s the same as saying “All alcohol is bad” which also isn’t the case. An excess of either is bad. Nothing in life is as black and white as that. There is nothing unhealthy with a muffin top. In fact it displays an efficient digestive system.

So some fat is fine, it’s actually healthier (on the whole) than a six pack. It’s healthier than overloading our digestive systems with protein shakes and vitamin drinks. Our bodies require a varied diet, including some fat.

Fat in moderation should be part of our diet.";-1;0;False;PM_ME_HKT_PUFFIES;dqba8rl;They never told me that buying the lambo would be the easy part...;7faf08;https://i.imgur.com/UG8gBML.gifv

Husband isn't weak but he isn't super strong either. He has a lot of weird things that it's hard to find literature / studies on and it intrigues me. He has fluctuated between 167 and 172 pounds for around 25 years. The 172 is when he is working out often and gets more muscle tone. His ""fat"" is a tiny bit of softness over his 6 pack on his stomach. He has never tried to get super strong lifting weights and such so no idea if he'd hit the same ceiling but going from out of shape to in shape is about a week or so of manual labor. 

I do know he never quits fidgeting and saw that study that came out recently but that is only supposed to account for a few hundred calories. I think he's burning calories in his damn sleep or something. 

And then October hits and his 18 to 20 hour days of being awake / working turn into 12 hours half awake and deadly tired after in winter months. Certain foods knock him stupid as well.

"Oh man I share your pain. I’m 6’4 and naturally carry a very small amount of muscle. I quite lifting and started back up over a year ago and weighed 170. I’m at 190 now but being tall nobody can even notice lol. It takes a very long time to fill out at that height so just be prepared for several years of hard work before it’s noticeable to others unless your walking around naked all the time. 


Yeah man if you’re hitting the gym hard I would honestly just start right off at 4K calories a day and weigh yourself every morning and record it so you can make adjustments. I eat that amount and don’t eat much sugar at all. In fact I’m mostly vegetarian unless I’m eating out or making something special. It can be done with the right foods. Nuts, nut butters, seeds, legumes of all kinds, piling healthy fats on your food ect will
be a massive help. The shakes are honestly the best, you really can’t beat drinking up to 1200 calories in 5 min. And I find that because it was blended to hell and was liquid I’m able to eat much sooner again then if I ate something like 8 eggs, sausage, and toast.

"I tracked his calories at two points in life, when he was 18 and again in 2010/2011. 6000 calories per day on average for a stretch of 3+ months both times. He works 18 to 20 hours a day and 7 days per week in the spring and summer months, barely eats in the winter. He has that fidget gene shit and never stops shaking his leg or similar.

You and 50,000 other people can keep calling everyone that doesn't fit into your worldview misinformed but it is you that is missing useful data. I know one other guy that is skinny to an unhealthy degree and you will never catch him without food in his hand. I don't count his calories but he eats all fucking day, every day. To pretend there are no outliers is extremely foolish.

When my husband was active in high school (football, etc) he ate breakfast before school, lunch at school, snacks throughout the school day, a meal when he got home, a meal when his parents cooked supper and a meal before bed. The meals he ate were real food so not fast food and such but still more than you and the other naysayers here would say is possible.

The most recent 6,000+ calories per day were things like 

Breakfast - Deluxe Breakfast from McDonalds @ 1219 calories. 

Lunch - Grilled Chicken Salad From Waffle House @ 100? calories. 

Lunch - 10 packages of ranch dressing @ 2300 calories. 

Dinner - Various fast food meals from McDonalds, sit down chinese restaurants etc @ 800 to 1500 calories or more.

So going by 800 calories at dinner and ignoring the occasional candy bar, etc we are at 4419 calories.

He drank two 2 liter cokes per day during this time. I could be an idiot but that is 1680 calories in my silly girl math bringing us to 6099 calories. He didn't lick his plates clean so I'm sure there were 99 calories in dressing leftover. 

Every single day for over 3 months without an ounce of extra weight.

Yes there are the outliers but I find it near impossible he actually consumed 6k calories a day and didn’t gain weight. Metabolism is not just some rate at which your metabolize your food. Metabolism involves chemical reactions in every cell of ones body that use calories to keep the body alive. It’s not as if that can be manipulated to 3x higher than average. It’s just not possible. If he truly tracked and weighed all his food which was 6k+ and only had moderate activity I would strongly recommend seeing a professional as he clearly is not digesting the majority of that food. Without doing an incredible amount of physical activity, riding a bike for an hour burns about 500 calories if your husband is around 180lbs. He would have to ride said bike at least 7 hours a day to consume those calories and not have it turn to fat. He can’t force his body on a uniform, cellular level, to increase its rate of metabolism by 2-3 times without doing very high levels of activity such as that. To give you another example, Eddie hall, the worlds strongest man who has deadlifted 1100 pounds and weighs 410 pounds at 6’3 eats around 6500 calories on most days.  ;2;1;False;jg87iroc;dqbhowt;They never told me that buying the lambo would be the easy part...;7faf08;https://i.imgur.com/UG8gBML.gifv

"Do you know that people defend their interests by making sure the govt does not make bad policy decisions?

This is very similar to what is happening with NN.";1;1;False;lerkmore;dqamlns;Don't let the FCC destroy the net! Take your stand;7ekd24;http://battleforthenet.com
"Okay, so your argument now rests on the notion that we should petition the govt to privatize all roads and sidewalks. According to the article you posted, the solution to the Excessive Duplication problem is private roads and sidewalks.

>Under private ownership of streets and sidewalks, individual owners are offered a tradeoff of lower utility prices for the temporary inconvenience of having a utility company run a trench through their property.

Is this seriously your solution to the NN issue? If not, what is?";1;1;False;lerkmore;dqap1d1;Don't let the FCC destroy the net! Take your stand;7ekd24;http://battleforthenet.com

Still gone up over 10x in a year. And far from nothing. 70x is doable.
