/edit: I have to add the obligatory advice: **Don't invest more than you can afford to lose!**

Not trying to tell people what to do, but if someones tells you Bitcoin is *safe* to invest, no it is not, but it has tons of potential obviously.";2484;15;False;WalterRyan;dmg5gfe;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png
"> There is one really simple scenario that kills BTC: One big government ""attacks"" it, particularly someone like China. China doesn't play by any rules and can shut down/take over every BTC related asset in China. They can ban BTC tomorrow, imprison whoever they want in China, take over all the mining operations, etc. People think crypto is secure and that they alone control their coins, but in China, you don't. The government can take anything and everything from you. Hell, for all you know, the Chinese government already controls almost all of the Chinese network.

You may have seen the meme that Bitcoin is the ""honey badger"" of money.  So you have Bitcoin this badger that has been running around growing, fighting lions, just generally being a little badass badger for 8 years.

But there's Zookeepers who have guns and most people think that pretty soon a Zookeeper is going to decide the $80 Billion Badger has to be put down, and he will go get his rifle and shoot the badger in the head.

What they don't expect is that the badger, unlike Harambe, will be found to be bulletproof and may very well maul one of the zookeepers in the process.

Bitcoin isn't a cute little badger that can be kept in a cage or put down if it gets too big.  Its an immortal god-currency that destroy every other currency in existence as well as every government whose existence depends on said underlying currencies.";1;2;False;ztsmart;dmgd7xb;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png
"If you really want to know head over to nakamoto institute and read their articles.  They articulate the thesis much better than I can.  

To sum it up, when currencies compete with each other the one with the best monetary properties wins.

"> Suppose legislation gets passed that outlaws it or regulates it into obscurity.

If Bitcoin can be shut down by the government, it is worthless.

I think the US government's War on Drugs shows the difficulty in regulating something people want into obscurity.  I suspect that if the US government makes it illegal to own bitcoin the price will go up substantially.  It's like drugs or ivory.  

Here's the thing though, imagine what happens when government points its gun at Bitcoin and fires and the world sees Bitcoin standing their unscathed.  

>And digital currency is the furthest thing from a ""low risk"" opportunity.

What's the risk you see?  Is it government ""shutting down"" bitcoin as you say above?  It's going to be interesting for sure, but Bitcoin is super easy to hide, transport, and secure.  Imagine how well the US's War on Drugs would be going if drugs could be made invisible, perfectly secured, or teleported anywhere in the world.

Also there's two really good articles you should read about how bitcoin will just subvert government agents who are sent to shut it down.

"This is good.  This is the type of analysis I was talking about, but I would confidently say bitcoin would shrug all of these off, and some would have no effect--like side chain risk, unless you are invisioning a very large side chain that makes up a significant amount of coins unlike anything we have today.  

As for regulator shutting down exchanges...This is where people are going to see how immune Bitcoin us to government fuckery, and when that happens I expect bitcoin will go UP in value.

You point out one concern that had me very worried until recently-

> maybe bitcoin ossifies to such a degree that it can't even implement upgrades to the protocol that it absolutely needs to be competitive in the space and it gets replaced by something else.

I did not expect Segwit to get activated and was seriously worried that this could impair bitcoin enough to allow another currency to overtake it, but then Bitcoin overcame this challenge like a champ.  I speculate that this resilience is why the price has gone up so much lately.  You can literally stick a fork in Bitcoin and it's not done.

In any case, now make a similar list for the US Dollar--what can cause it to fall in value.  Then compare the two lists.";0;1;False;ztsmart;dmgbgq9;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

"Ill sum up my thoughts but I think if you really want to understand you should head over to the nakamoto institute and read all the articles in their mempool.

It is also helpful to list out the possible ways bitcoin *could* fail and analyze each of them.  But in short, bitcoin has near-perfect monetary properties that put it head-and-shoulders above other non-crypto currencies when it comes to usefulness as money.  

We can look to many examples of where currencies of the past came into competition with one another and we can conclude that the one with the better monetary properties drives out the other weaker currencies.  I think the name for this is Thiel's law but I can look it up if you are interested.  People see ""Safe"" US dollars and ""Risk"" Bitcoin--they see a ""David and Goliath"" situation, and so do I.  It's just most people get the ""David and Goliath"" story wrong.

"Oh shit you got me on a logical semantics argument. Well DONE!

Yes there is a difference between the *lottery* and the Superbowl. The difference is that nobody participating in the lottery can be certain that anyone will win the prize. In the Superbowl, all the people who bet on the winning team WILL DEFINITELY win a ""prize"". (I know there are things you can bet on like score-splits and whatnot that may not occur during the game, but seriously that is people adding more uncertainty to a system in hope of increasing their winnings - whatever!)

Again though, the outcome of the Superbowl is not random. One team is going to win (or there will be a draw I guess - does that happen though?). There are a lot of variables that makes it hard to correctly guess which team wins, but it's not random. Someone WILL win.

You are not ""an idiot"" for betting ion the Superbowl, it's a perfectly straightforward form of gambling that you can increase your chances of winning through research on the teams etc.

I am in no way arguing that this guy with the Bitcoin loan didn't take a RISK, a really big RISK on Bitcoin. But he's not an idiot. He made an informed choice and he was correct.

There's another difference between Bitcoin and the Superbowl though. NOBODY WHO BET ON BITCOIN LOST. Nobody. If the choice is ""don't bet, or bet and definitely win"" then that is very different to sports.

Idiotic is making a decision against your best interest for no goddamn reason at all. Idiotic is when you are told all the risks and possible outcomes, and you make a decision for which there is no guaranteed outcome at all.

There is a guaranteed outcome for Bitcoin - it will go up or it will go down. Betting on it is not ""idiotic"". It is risky.

The point is that everyone looks at this guys success and wants to dismiss it as ""luck"". It wasn't ""luck"". His result did not come about because a bunch of balls fell out of a basket in a certain order. His result came about because everyone got into Bitcoin. He guessed that this would happen and he was right.

HE'S NOT IDIOTIC. If he had not made this decision he would have less money.

You can't dismiss that. You need to adjust your analysis to something a bit more complex than ""yeah sure, he got lucky, but he was an idiot to risk so much.""

HE WASN'T AN IDIOT because the risk paid off. 

Is it idiotic to say ""oh well this DEFINITELY means that Bitcoin will continue to go up so I will borrwo $400K from a loan shark"". Yes of course it is. Is it idiotic to say ""Hmn... Bitcoin always goes up... I think I will risk a little more because of this information, maybe even to the point where a downturn could hurt me."" No, that's not idiotic. That's a calculated risk.

""Don't risk more than you can afford to lose"" is trite and SAFE. None of you care whether some random guy goes bankrupt because of a bad Bitcoin call - in fact you'd fucking LOVE crowing over it. But you're all so scared of someone saying ""hey you told me this was a sure thing"" that you're nonsensically insisting that a person who made $600K without working IS AN IDIOT.

"Okay at some point I will have to admit this is an argument of logical semantics which is probably unwinnable, but let's try to break it down.

Because he bucked the doctrine of this place by risking MORE than he could afford to lose.

2. What was his experience?
He made $600K+ before tax.

3. What are our possible responses?
This is where it gets interesting. We can either use his experience to counter-logically insist that risking everything is always really really bad. Or we can USE his experience to understand what risk really means.

To simply dismiss him as ""stupid"" or ""idiotic"" is shortsighted and boring. We need to examine the circumstances that led him to making the risk.

Now, apparently (I haven't checked this) this guy was really sick. And that obviously changes his perception of risk and puts him in a situation that most of us don't share. So we need to take that into account.

However, the end result is that his risk paid off. Why? What does this say about Bitcoin? Does it make us look at the big picture and realise, if you hodl, Bitcoin always goes up? What does this *suggest* - not prove, but suggest - about the future of Bitcoin? How does it change our perception of what ""don't risk more than you can afford"" means?

I'd argue that buying a ticket in the lottery is ""idiotic"" even if you win $350 million. Because no matter what you do, what you read, what you learn, and even who you try to manipulate, the lottery is random. You cannot know the result. The vast vast majority of lottery ticket buyers - a mathematical singularity, really - don't win.

But with Bitcoin, EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO GOT IN EARLY HAS WON. This is important. This  affects our analysis of the risk.

Past performance is no *guarantee* of future gains. That can be read several ways. But it 100% does NOT mean future gains won't be the same or larger. But buying into Bitcoin now is neither idiotic or stupid. It is a calculated risk based on available data.

">List them out. Bitcoin has already had serious flaws found in its cryptography--for instance someone found an exploit to add like 100 billion bitcoins to the blockchain, and it came out of that situation like a champ. I can't see a plausible scenario in which bitcoin goes to zero. 

if that happened today it would be a SERIOUS problem. they solved that by going back and reorging the chain. luckily back then it was easy to just put software out there and tell people to run it and they did. that doesn't happen today. we can't get anyone to agree on anything today. on top of that, back then there was no infrastructure that was riding on top of bitcoin. right now there is over 1000 transactions put into the blockchain every 10 minutes. back then it was people playing around with it and there was an average of less than 3 transactions per block. even if we assuming that the bug is discovered, fixed, and deployed in 24 hours which would be ASTOUNDING, you would be undoing hundreds of thousands of transactions.

another potential failure mode is that the game theory doesn't wind up being as sound, or scaling up as well as we thought. maybe people start selfish mining, maybe jihan decides to 51 percent denial of service bitcoin because he likes bitcoin cash or segwit2x. maybe jihan and his buddies decide to short bitcoin for a large sum of money because their miners are losing their efficacy, and their new design either didn't have a high yield or don't work properly so when they short they start selfish mining and reorg the whole blockchain after a couple of days or any number of 51 percent attacks. Maybe we deploy paul storzc's drivechains and the game theory doesn't line up there and the miners wind up stealing all the money on the sidechain.

maybe some rogue developer sneaks in some bugs or exploits intentionally.

maybe there's a sidechain with very high fungibility like monero or zcash and there is a bug that is discovered or planted by a dev that allows for hidden, secret inflation inside of the sidechain. using payment channels and atomic swaps you can creating infinite bitcoins inside of this high fungibility sidechain and get your money out using atomic swaps such that no one will ever know there was a problem until you settle the transaction.

Maybe the regulators come in and close down all of the exchanges. maybe them doing this removes the overwhelming majority of the liquidity from the space and makes it difficult to get in and out of bitcoin. maybe that causes the price to crash.

maybe bitcoin ossifies to such a degree that it can't even implement upgrades to the protocol that it absolutely needs to be competitive in the space and it gets replaced by something else.

these are just a couple of things that i thought up off of the top of my head. there could be any number of other problems that i haven't thought of, and there could be any number of situations that no one has considered yet. even though you analyzed it and solved it for us that doesn't mean it's a sure bet. that is far from the case.

Suppose legislation gets passed that outlaws it or regulates it into obscurity.

Multiple states are already in various stages of putting laws on the books regarding the use and sale of digital currency. New York was once touted as US's nascent crypto capital - alas, no more. Some companies left the state as a result. North Dakota tried to pass a related bill in the house and failed.

There's a senate bill in the judiciary as we speak looking to put regulations in place as well. It's not just a US issue, either. Plenty of other countries are giving push back against digital currency as well. When China announced it would look into cracking down on Bitcoin in mid-January it's price fell ~30% in a matter of days.

"The reasoning is the same whether it's poker or sports betting or cryptos: A successful (or unsuccessful) outcome doesn't alter whether it was a smart bet at the time you made it. Winning after gambling against the odds doesn't make it a good decision in retrospect. That's the fallacy of results oriented thinking.

What makes a good bet is having sufficient understanding of the odds (or the fundamentals), the consequences, the risk and reward. If you have 10% chance of winning and the payoff is 11:1, that's a good bet. But if you can't afford the loss, it's a bad bet. 

With crypto trading we don't know the precise odds, so we bet on our understanding of the coin and the market being correct. We might have a poor understanding and get lucky, which would be a bad bet. Or we might have excellent understanding and get screwed by some unforeseen development, in which case it was still a good bet.

The outcome on its own tells us very little about whether we made the bet for the right reasons. Drawing meaningful inferences based on the outcome requires repeated trials under the same conditions, enough times to overcome variance. In trading as with poker, you can go on hot streaks for months and then lose everything because the variance is high. The true profitability of your decision process is only revealed after sufficient bets/trades to overcome the luck factor.

This is why it's unequivocally a bad move to bet your whole bankroll unless the profitability of your decision making process is tried and tested AND you can afford to lose it all.

Like I said, I used Electron Cash and then moved my BCH ASAP and exchanged it. But there might be a better option now - I just used the first one I could find as I thought BCH would eventually crash so I wanted to get in there early!

"> Basically IF the number 1 crypto currency were supplanted by #2, no rational investor should then own #2 because it too could be replaced by #3.

I see you've said this a few times in this thread already. I'm confused by your logic because according to it, if crypto currency #1 has the chance of getting supplanted by crypto currency #2, then no investor should invest in neither #1, #2, nor any other crypto currency because it could always just get replaced and thus lose its value. 

Each time the top crypto currency gets replaced, it gets harder for that new top dog currency to get replaced, since it must be better than the one it replaces. (So it's harder for #3 to replace #2 than it is for #2 to replace #1).

Say #1 is nearly perfect; it has only one ""flaw"" which #2 doesn't have, thus making it ""perfect"". Obviously #2 would replace #1. It couldn't get replaced by anything better because it is perfect. 

So relating this to your example: if bitcoin, which you mentioned is your idea of near perfect money, was replaced by another crypto currency, that replacement would *have* to be ""better."" If Bitcoin is so great and it got replaced by something *better* I would think it rational to invest in that. ";3;1;False;Dr_KingTut;dmgkuer;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

"The points you are making here are good but you must take this into account: we are in the startup phase.

An increasing number of merchants take bitcoin directly. Are they merchants you personally want to use right now? Probably not. But saying Bitcoin is unspendable (as Bitcoin) is like, back in 1915, saying middle class people can't afford to have a telephone in their own home, so telephone technology is pointless since everyone has to go to the telegram office anyway.

To some extent we are like startup investors, providing the seed capital for future returns. It's not quite like that, because it's not like a company takes our money and we have nothing more to do with it. You and I can do business in Bitcoin right now, no problem. I can ask for a picture of your computer, and offer 0.00002BTC if you email it to me. As soon as I get the email, I can send the 0.00002BTC to your account. We might have to wait for the transaction to confirm for a bit, and the fee might be stupid high, but those are issues that can and will be solved.

Because the ability to exchange goods and services for Bitcoin already exists, it will roll out very quickly. You'll see. This will be a Bitcoin Christmas.

As for these people who sell 30,000 to dip the market... this is correct in *theory* but consider that it's such a huge amount of money right now. What exchange or what individual would give this player (checks price) holy shit $140 million dollars for 30,000 BTC all at once at the top of an all time high?

They would have to sell it in bits, and each bit would realise less than the bit before. But the time they are dumping the last 1000BTC, the price will probably be down 10%. Yet, such is the demand right now, will it slump that much?

They could quite realistically end up with only $100 million cash but a Bitcoin price of $4500. Converting that back into Bitcoins would only give them 22,222 (huh, neat) BTC.

Could a big sale like that put Bitcoin into a super-big-slump where the big sale is just the beginning of it? Sure, technically. But right now everyone is so convinced the price will go up, if it drops even just $200 they pounce and start buying again. The age of the super-swings may be over.

"That's a very simplistic reading of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. What happened was that too many homes were built, more than enough to meet demand.

So the value of the homes was not going to go up through simple supply-and-demand. So dodgy banks knowingly decided to try to get people to take out mortgages on these homes *in full knowledge* that the interest paid on the mortgage would not be offset by the rise in the home's value.

They sold so many cheap mortgages they ran out of customers. So they started signing up people who they knew could not pay for the mortgages (because bank peeps were getting paid bonuses for signing people up, creating an incentive to fudge incomes and ability to repay).

Then the banks figured out that a whole lot of people were going to default their mortgages, lumping the banks with whole bunch of worthless properties (because in the US - generally - you can just give the keys to the bank and say sorry can't pay, in other countries the bank sells the house and comes after you for the balance).

So the banks cooked the books and tried to sell the debt (the mortgages) to other companies. It became all about who was going to be left facing into the wind when the shit hit the fan.

When the market finally admitted the mortgages were worthless (remember, a mortgage generates income for a bank through interest payments) the system collapse. The collapse infected other parts of the economy and the rest is history.

Exactly what aspect of Bitcoin do you think is a conscious lie, where people are going to wake up tomorrow and say ""hang on... I have to pay another $500 for the coins I currently hold today and I don't have any money.""

If you hold coins you paid for them. If you took a loan and are going to default on that loan, that's outside Bitcoin's network and not Bitcoin's problem - you will sell your coins back into the system and the price will go down, but there's no current possibility that a giant percentage of the network is suddenly going to go ""HAHA all those transactions that pushed up the price never really happened!""

Bitcoin as an investment may not be special, but it's *different*. Your purchase of a coin cannot be fucked up by Bitcoin's CEO embezzling funds and running away to the Caymans. Nor can it be fucked up by a bunch of employees of Bitcoin making false entries on the blockchain. It's just... not the same.

As to it being a Ponzi... if everyone suddenly tried to exchange all their coins for fiat, the people who break first will get cashed out, and the price will drop fairly rapidly. But we won't have ""Bitcoin central"" saying ""Um... actually I know we said the market cap was $80 billion but actually there's only $2 billion in the bank so... uh... yeah... bye!""

The coin is worth $4900 (or whatever) right now because someone just this minute paid nearly $4900 for a coin (or portion thereof. Yes, there isn't enough value in the whole system to instantly cash everyone out at $4900. But neither is it all built on lies and fairy floss. People bought these coins with real money over time.

Crucially, Bitcoin itself cannot lend me money to buy Bitcoins. This happens to other financial products, and it's what sows the seeds of collapse. All Bitcoin's funding is from people who actually bought Bitcoins. There's no ""seed capital"" that has to be paid back. No ""dividends"". You will never get money out of Bitcoin without giving up some of your Bitcoin. That's important.

Even more importantly, your Bitcoin will always be worth the same as mine. I can't have a ""less valuable"" Bitcoin, there's no system like you have to hold your Bitcoin for a month before it ""matures"" or whatever. If THAT was part of the system, then it could be a Ponzi scheme - the money I paid would go to your Bitcoin to ""top it up"" and mature it so you could use it. And I would hope the next people buying in would ""top up"" my Bitcoin. 

Yes, people buying in increase the value of our Bitcoins, but the new people's coins are also instantly at that value. 

There's no way SOME people withe Bitcoins can win while other people with Bitcoins can lose. The only way to ""lose"" is to hold your Bitcoins for too long in a rout and not sell out until you're in a situation where only a few people are left wanting to buy them.

That's not Ponzi or Pyramid. That's supply and demand.

So, over the period 2013 to 2017, Bitcoin did not suffer a net loss. So  if I had guaranteed your $1000, I would not have had to pay you out. Fact.

Your question about ""zero chance of going down"" is imprecise. Did Bitcoin ""go down"" at various times during that period? Yes. But the net result was a gain.

Again, you're writing here in 2017 trying to assign ""chance"" to a single event with a single outcome. If we had 10 guys who all bought in 2010 and held to 2017, and 3 of them went bust and 7 made money, we can say the ""chance"" of making money 2010-2017 was 7:3.

But the fact is that EVERYONE who bought and held Bitcoin 2010-2017 made money. So the chance of making money 2010-2017 if you bought-and-held Bitcoin was 100%.

I know I know, you want to assuage your disappointment at not investing a large amount in, say, June, by telling yourself that anyone who did invest big without knowing today's result was an ""idiot"".

But how is doing that going to help you increase your rate of return? Instead of dismissing ""big winners"" as ""idiots who got lucky"", why not investigate what it was that made them confident enough to invest big, at that time?

Why don't millions of people take the same risk as this guy? Because they are too afraid of risk. That's not idiotic either. But in this case, if the desired outcome is ""make a lot of money"", then the decision to NOT put a lot of money in Bitcoin in 2010 (argh, or 2013, sorry I keep getting the start date mixed up, fortunately when it comes to Bitcoin it doesn't matter!) was wrong.

Let me complicate my point by instead looking at people who CASHED OUT in, say 2014. Was it ""idiotic"" to cash out when Bitcoin was going to climb all the way to $5000 from (depending on the month) $750?

No it's not idiotic, because every single person who had decided not to cash out at $1200 was holding Bitcoins worth $750. Cashing out in 2014 merely turned out to be wrong.

Do you see the difference? It's important. Calling someone's decision ""idiotic"" means you are dismissing it as not worth analysis. If you call it ""wrong"" then you can analyse why it was wrong and improve YOUR decision making.";1;0;False;;dmgq4h4;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

I see people pointing to things they think are risk to bitcoin but have determined them to be non-issues.  Like government shutting bitcoin down....yeah sure, good luck with that. 

Conversely, I see a lot of risk where others see safety e.g. US dollars in a savings account.

Disagree on paragraph 2.  The network effect is huge and it is the only thing that protects 1 from 2.  If this effect is shown to be a small enough gap that it can be overcome  I think 2 is at more risk of then being overtaken by 3.

"Gold, for example, has a price that is made up partially 1) its utility value and 2) its use as a store of value.  For gold almost all of the value is from #2 with only <10% from #1.  For reference dollars and bitcoin have ~100% of their price from #2.

Let's call this principle currency entanglement.  That is when a good or commodity has its price become disconnected from its utility price because people are using it as a store of value.

So a stock, would likely be very resistant to this entanglement and would likely have ~100% of its price come form #1 (utility).  Real estate though, seems to frequently be used as a store of value.  In other words real estate seems to me to have a degree of currency entanglement to the point that houses are not valued as a sum of their future expected rents less expenses, like they would be if they were valued exclusively for their utility.  It seems to me there is an additional premium on top of this value that comes from #2--the real estate's use as a store of value. 

If Bitcoin becomes the global dominate currency like i expect it will, people will have a very easy and secure way to store their value and the price premium real estate has from #2 --which is probably around 10% but maybe more in some markets, will decline and prices should align with the value of their utility (#1).


Now if after reading this you think Im a crazy person, you should note that in situations where a currency collapses but land property rights protection remains secure, land/houses gain a very significant premium until the currency crisis abates and prices adjust back to what they were.

Every single person who bought in 2010 and hodled until today made money (at least on their Bitcoin, outside in the real world I have no idea of course).

The concept of ""chance"" doesn't apply to past events.

Look, I know there's a natural instinct or whatever to calculate risk by pretending you are in the past looking at where you are in the present. But anything you say about being in the past predicting the present is meaningless. In fact, to make it seems like a person in the past was taking a risk of losing their money, you have to consciously ignore the actual outcome that really happened. You have to invoke parallel universes, all that.

Again, I'm not arguing that at the time he did not take a risk. I am arguing that it was not ""idiotic"". He looked at data, he made a calculation, he took the risk and it paid off.

There's this weird confabulation of ""risk"" and ""foolishness"". That if you are taking any risk, it's in some way a silly thing to do. Throughout the history of commerce, it has been demonstrated over and over again that if you want serious profit you have to take a risk.

"At this level we are into a semantic argument which is difficult to resolve in any meaningful way. You're getting into very granular definition of ""idiot.""

If you define ""idiot"" as ""making a choice where there is a definite outcome either way but you can't know which way it will break"" then, well, pretty much every decision anyone makes about anything is ""idiotic"".

Betting that the Patriots will win by 2000 points is ""idiotic"" because it's outside the reasonable scope of possible outcomes. Merely betting that the Patriots will WIN isn't idiotic, because it's only one of two outcomes, and one or other of the outcomes HAS to happen.

However, the other thing with betting on the Superbowl vs investing in Bitcoin, is that you also know that one team MUST lose (I'm discounting draws here... can the Superbowl draw? I dunno). 

With Bitcoin, there is currently NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PRICE WILL EVER GO DOWN PERMANENTLY. Everyone just assumes it can because ""investments"" sometimes do that. But is Bitcoin like anything else? No, I think it is reasonable to assert at this point that it does not ""crash"" like other systems. Not in the same way, to the same level.

If the price drops catastrophically, and the game is up, well that's an unpredictable outcome based on existing data. It's an ""act of God"" if you will.

Refusing to take any risk because you are worried about an ""act of God"" event is, by definition ""idiotic"". Limiting your risk against a possible Act of God event isn't idiotic, but it will limit the possible size of the reward you can realise.

Why do I care about this issue? Because Bitcoin relies on everyone backing it. And if we dismiss the early winners as ""idiots"" for super-backing it, then that's not good for the future of the system.

"I would recommend spending a good amount of time researching the history of money.  In order to understand how bitcoin is going to compete and why it is going to win, you must first understand what drives a currency to become more valuable than others--specifically what properties would an ideal money have?

> Anyway, would you concede the possibility of a superior crypto technology that simply isn't compatible in any way with bitcoin, and as such can't be similarly incorporated, taking over? It could be like a repeat of bitcoin, but in a new technology space. I'm not sure if this is at all likely, it probably isn't, but do you think it's even a possibility?

This is something i considered when I first looked seriously into Bitcoin.  Why buy bitcoin when it can just be replaced by Bitcoin 2.0 causing bitcoin to lose all value?

I eventually came to the following conclusion.

* Bitcoin seems to be perfect money--That is, it is difficult for me to even imagine a way a currency could have better monetary properties than bitcoin already has.  Can you think of an advantage another currency could have over bitcoin?  I cannot.

* If this were the case, Bitcoin could fork and change to copy the new features with the same block history.

* We don't really see this in currencies as money is a market that favors a natural monopoly.  Gold doesn't get replaced by Silver for example.

One more piece of advice.  Understand your reasons for buying to the point you have sufficient confidence to weather short-mid term price fluctuation.

Bitcoin is like any other currency in that if you want to exchange it, someone has to buy it. Banks or governments usually do that and are kinda required to do that the currency is stable. Bitcoin has no such mechanism in place to support it. 

Bitcoin can barely buy anything without being sold first. 

And I say this as a bitcoin investor (small scale). It will burst. 

Right now, the main attraction of bitcoin is that you don't need anyone else to be in the chain. It is anonymous. It's also a online currency so you don't need coins and thus can be split indefinitely. Which are really good things when you can't mine any more (at around 21 million I think). 

However, if no one can buy with it and no one is buying it, you can't use it and it crashes. It is rising in the hopes that it will be similar to a legal currency in that you can buy your groceries with it.

"> Bitcoin bifurcates again and again, and one or more alts take its place

* If anything I think this was MORE of a risk until recently. We just saw that Bitcoin can take a fork to the heart and not even slow down.  As for altcoins, you can logically conclude that a currency with larger network has huge advantages over a similar one with a smaller network (less liquidity, etc).  You can then conclude that because of this feedback loop once a currency gets a lead over others it will retain its dominance unless another currency offers something very substantial to the market to overcome such a large economic moat.  Also, if CC #1 were to get replaced by CC #2, any rational holders of CC #2 should immediately sell because they have no way have knowing CC #2 would not be supplanted by CC #3.

Also see the article ""The problem with altcoins""

> Dollar/etc never collapse, Keynesians were right all along, no need for Bitcoin

If the dollar doesn't collapse, then it will still collapse just much more slowly.  The supply of dollars is going to continue to increase as long as they have value, and if the eventual supply of dollars is infinite then the eventual price is going to be zero.  

> Keynesians were wrong, Dollar tanks, but drastic steps are taken and it is saved, no need for Bitcoin

That kind of happened in 2008.  If this happens and a miracle save is pulled off then there will eventually be a time when the government minders are not able to save the dollar with their Keynesian voodoo.  Also, if the Keynesians are right, it is STILL better for an individual to own a deflationary currency than an inflationary one.

> Feds find ways to regulate use and possession of Bitcoin, bitcoins live alongside dollar as secondary currency but never replace it

Their ability to restrict and  control drugs does note bode well for their ability to restrict something that can be invisible, perfectly secured, and teleported instantly.  I guess they can try, but I think it will only make demand for bitcoin to go up. 

> Feds find ways to make use and possession illegal, with drug decriminalization there's now a lot of prison space available and a lot of corporate prisons looking for new profits

I think the government you're imagining exists is way more powerful and competent than the ones that actually exist.  Good luck trying to prove possession on something that can disappear and reappear at will or be stored in people's brains.

> Some nations experience financial instability, move to Bitcoin as reserve currency

This would require nation to own or buy a substantial amount of Bitcoin

> All currencies collapse, only Bitcoin is left

"For this we look to markets where there were currencies competing against other currencies with similar or identical properties for reference and we see that currencies benefit tremendously from network effects.

In order for another auction site to replace eBay it would have to offer substantial value to overcome this tremendous advantage.

Also look to precious medals.  There is only Gold there is no 2nd place competitor that has ever come close to replacing gold's dominance (value of all the worlds silver = about 5% of the value of the world's gold).

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude.

Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

As described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."" Hence, the corollary to the Dunning–Kruger effect indicates that persons of high ability tend to underestimate their relative competence and erroneously presume that tasks that are easy for them to perform also are easy for other people to perform.

"> 1) Bitcoin could crash and remain low for 1-3 years at least , or never recover. There is moral hazard in telling people to destroy their finances with gambles. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will keep going up.

There is no guarantee that a person who does not borrow and has 100% of their money in government fiat will be able to protect their finances from utter destruction.   Everyone saying don't borrow money to ""gamble"" on bitcoin seems to be making two very wrong assumptions

* 1- US Dollars are ""safe"" and you can't lose money by holding them

* 2- Investing in Bitcoin is a gamble e.g. the outcome is essentially random or a game of chance.

Also, investors do this sort of thing all the time--look at the forex markets for example.

>2) Even if an investor does well financially , you are encouraging behavior that is reckless and may turn into a full on gambling habit in due time

My argument is that it is not reckless.  You should understand what you are doing though.  I agree many people investing in bitcoin do not understand it and may very well lose money because they are not confident or complete in their understanding of money.  IF someone does look at Bitcoin and concludes that for the past 8 years a superior currency has been gaining market share against shitty currencies, AND that there is nothing that can stop it from continuing to compete and win against them, then it is prudent to borrow debt denominated in those shitty currencies to buy the superior one.

>It starts with a equity loan ,the rush of quick returns in a bull market , than they start daytrading and leveraging on exchanges to feed their habit of the thrill of amazing returns on such short notice. It really isn't health.

Then you should be telling people not to invest based on reactionary emotion--but this also includes not holding dollars because they're ""backed by the full faith and credit blah blah blah"".  People should know what they are doing when they invest, but if they do, it is reasonable for them to take on debt as part of their calculated strategy.

>Smart investors are taking notice of people like you and their irrational exuberance and taking a queue that we might be hitting the top. You would offer better market confidence by being more level headed.

Bitcoin's success does not depend on market confidence.  You people can sell for all I care.  I've been here for 4 years and never once posted a ""HODL"" meme or advertised that I'm going to get ""cheap coins"" from the ""weak hands"".  I don't give a shit because I understand it doesn't matter.

"**Kelly criterion**

In probability theory and intertemporal portfolio choice, the Kelly criterion, Kelly strategy, Kelly formula, or Kelly bet, is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets. In most gambling scenarios, and some investing scenarios under some simplifying assumptions, the Kelly strategy will do better than any essentially different strategy in the long run (that is, over a span of time in which the observed fraction of bets that are successful equals the probability that any given bet will be successful). It was described by J. L. Kelly, Jr, a researcher at Bell Labs, in 1956. The practical use of the formula has been demonstrated.

"> bitcoin is a perfect example of a high RISK high reward asset. 

I understand that you see this as a high risk asset.  I would argue you are attributing risk where there is none.  I would suggest you articulate the risk and do your own detailed analysis.  How does Bitcoin fail--list the ways it can fail.  Is there a scenario in which bitcoin is worth LESS in US dollars in 10 years then it is today?  Articulate this scenario.

>Something can't both have low risk(aka safe) and high reward. that is called a free lunch. those do not exist.

This is the kind of thing shitty investors who have no clue what they are talking about say.  I am a small real estate investor.  Earlier this year my agent found me a stupid good deal where a commercial foreclosure property was listed (but not advertised well) at about 2/3 its market value.  I was able to get the property for 1/2 it's value and could have easily sold and recovered 100% of my investment under ANY reasonable scenario.  People keep saying  there is no such thing as high reward + low risk.  NO--that is NOT the case.  High reward + low risk DOES exist they are just rarer and require you to see what others do not.  But keep telling yourself that.  I guess the commercial property I own doesn't exist either, but the checks still keep coming in.

>but it also very easily could go to zero if for one example, a serious flaw is found in the cryptography. any number of other things happen that could cause bitcoin to fail.

List them out.  Bitcoin has already had serious flaws found in its cryptography--for instance someone found an exploit to add like 100 billion bitcoins to the blockchain, and it came out of that situation like a champ.  I can't see a plausible scenario in which bitcoin goes to zero.  ";0;4;False;ztsmart;dmg8xzx;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

"No he could not have lost his house because Bitcoin grew in price between 2013 and 2017.

I don't understand why you think there is some random element to this. There isn't. If you didn't buy Bitcoin back in 2013, then you made the wrong choice, simple as that. (I made the wrong choice, and I can admit that.)

As I said to the other guy, it's not like buying 100BTC in 2013 gave you a 50-50 chance of winning a prize. It gave you a 100% certainty of having about $50,000 worth of BTC today. Just because they didn't know that at the time doesn't change the fact that this was a sure bet.

There is no random element here. Only an UNKNOWN element. It is not idiotic to make a choice when you don't know the outcome. NOTHING we do is certain. I work all month on the expectation my boss will pay me at the end, but the company could go bust before then. Am I an idiot for not working for money up front?

I know it seems counter-intuitive but from where we are standing now, NOT buying Bitcoin was the ""idiotic"" decision. Bitcoin could have made you a millionaire from an input of just $25. 

Adjust your justifications for not believing in Bitcoin earlier. Admit you didn't think it could be this big, or you didn't realise what seems obvious now - in a world where fiat currencies are inflating into nothingness and nobody can earn shit on high interest deposits, there will be a demand for something else.

ETA: You will say ""urgh but you can't say that it was a 100% bet from the perspective of someone in 2013."" Sure. Like right now we can't say BTC will 100% go to one million. BUT WE AREN'T SPEAKING IN 2013. We're speaking now. We don't exist in all times and all places. It is perfectly valid to say ""wow that guy really believed in Bitcoin and his belief paid off"" in the same way it's valid to say ""haha those poor chumps who sold at $1000!!"".

There is no random chance in this journey. Every rise and fall is caused by human decisions. Not all of them will be made in good faith, but there is no random element at play.";-4;2;False;;dmgm03y;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png
"> Mortgaging your house isn't in line with that kind of risk.

I bought bitcoin over the past 3 years while I also bought a house.  In particular I chose to put 5% down instead of 20% down for the purpose of buying more Bitcoin, which I did around $650.   Then Bitcoin tanked to like $200 and stayed there for almost a year and a half.  This whole time I was paying 4% interest on the money that I would have otherwise not borrowed.

The POINT is, when you can borrow at super low interest rates and half debt in an inflationary currency to buy a deflationary one, the odds are tremendously stacked in your favor.

2. Transaction on purchase taxed? I'm not sure what you mean? Do you mean the transaction fee? Or the exchange taking a cut? The exchange is a for-profit business. Why should it miss out on a profit so he can make a slightly bigger profit?

3. Conversion back to USD will be taxed. Again, the exchange incurred costs getting a hole of the USD it will use to pay the guy out, costs beyond the value of the Bitcoins he is selling. Again, they are entitled to make a profit.

4. Capital gains tax. Without it, systems like Bitcoin would allow people to simply evade tax. The country needs tax to operate. If you think the country - and country - can effectively operate with no tax then you are delusional.

Money circulates. If one dollar was slowly taxed away to nothing, sure that would be unfair. But one dollar, if circulated through the economy effectively, will grow to many thousands of dollars. It is fair that some of that be diverted to various things that ensure the person doing business can expect to still be doing business 10, 20, 30 years from now.

If Bitcoin had tanked, he could have paid back the mortgage for a bit then sold the house for more than $300K. Yeah, he ends up without a house which sucks. And any financial progress he's made up to the point that allowed him to buy a house gets reset, which sucks too.

But no one would have had to come by and break his knees. Also, in the US my understanding is you can say to your mortgagor ""Oh I can't pay this any more, here are the keys to the house, see ya."" And just walk away.

This is not like we all went up to a dealer and all got a separate hand dealt to us. There is no random outcome in this process. Everyone who bought 100BTC in March 2014 for $450 per coin, and did not sell, now has 100BTC worth something close to $50,000. All of them.

I understand this is how we deal with not making the right choice back in 2014, or 2013, or most of all 2010.

"News Flash: It is possible to lose money when investing.

* When you buy bitcoin, if you have ANY DEBT AT ALL, you are effectively borrowing to buy bitcoin.

* But borrowing to buy bitcoin is a VERY PRUDENT MOVE.  When you can take on debt in an inflationary currency to buy a deflationary currency, you do this--or at least you should.  ESPECIALLY when interest rates are artificially low.  

* It is annoying for people to dismiss a calculated investment in bitcoin based on sound economic analysis and sound monetary theory as ""gambling"".  If you look at the past 9 years of Bitcoin price action and see a slot machine you're a goddamn idiot.  It should be painfully obvious to anyone what is going on here--a currency with vastly superior monetary properties is gaining market share against shitty currencies.  

* But, but, but...you could LOSE money.  No fucking shit, bucko.  The world is a dangerous place and you can lose money investing.  You can also lose money not investing.  You can sit on your US dollars because herr derp, they're ""safe"" and still lose money because unexpected (to you) inflation erodes their value.  

* Investing in bitcoin or borrowing to do so may not be for you, but GTFO telling people they are stupid or foolish for doing so.  MAYBE THEY SEE SOMETHING YOU DON'T.

"Bitcoin is not like poker. Poker has randomness (well, to a point). The movement of Bitcoin SEEMS random, but is isn't, it's the result of the combination of lots of different people making decisions.

It's idiotic to think that Bitcoin ""must crash because everything crashes"". THAT is results oriented thinking too. It's idiotic to think ""since I am taking a really big risk, it MUST mean that I will lose money."" That's... I don't know what kind of thinking that is, but I see it all the time. 

This place is great how it really hammers home the message of don't buy more than you can afford to lose. But the fact is, when it comes to investing, the people who make the most money will always be the ones who take the right risk at the right time.

COULD he have lost it all? Sure. But DID he? No. Does this mean WE should immediately mortgage our houses to buy Bitcoin? HELL no. Does this mean that if we did do that though, we would definitely lose money? Also no.

The likelihood right now is that anyone who buys big into Bitcoin is going to end up with a lot of money if they hold for 10 years. Am I going to mortgage my home? No. Is it because I know I will lose money? No, it's because I'm a coward. Or more fairly, because I don't want to expose my family to even the slightest risk of being out on the street.

But I know, on the day BTC hits $100K, I will be thinking ""damn, I should have spent $50,000 instead of $5000"". ";-18;6;False;;dmg96n3;feeling crazy?;6xie13;http://i.imgur.com/lkBdxcK.png

"I almost always send a test-transaction before I transfer large amounts.

"The ""last crash"" you mentioned was due to Mt.Gox going down (the single largest exchange at the time, they had something like 80% of the trading volume in BTC at the time, so they essentially ruined  the market for bitcoin trading).  Do you really think 80% of the exchange volume will simply disappear in today's market?  I mean BTC-e went down not too long ago, and the market hardly batted an eye at that event.

These days, the things that threaten the price are the politics of scaling, forking, and ICOs.  Yet despite these things, the price keeps rising.  Bitcoin is anti-fragile.  Any kind of ""danger"" in the space only serves to promote the space to large investors, and in the end, progress still ensues.

I'm not saying the price won't ""correct"", but I highly doubt we'll see an 80% ""crash"" like the ""last crash"" you mentioned (but forgot to mention the dozen or so fairly major correction that have happened between then and now).";1;1;False;2btc10000pizzas;dmg5dlg;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg

"Yes. No. Maybe. Who knows.

I mean, this is crypto. Don't act like it was ""clearly not enough time"" because it was last time BTC made a big correction after going from $1,800 to near $3,000 around 3 months ago. It crashed back to around $2,000 in about a month taking most alts down with it.

This time? Well, it was not enough. I still think it will go down eventually and stabilise at some point, but then again, it made a huge jump around March-April and didn't go below $1,800.

"A lack of ability to predict with any real accuracy is equivalent to chance, and makes any move made equivalent to ""gambling.""  Further, there are events external to the Bitcoin network that influence the price, and that is totally and absolutely up to chance.  Not all gambling involves a house that takes a cut, either.  If a group of friends gather to play poker, it's still gambling.  Which doesn't apply here anyway because Bitcoin brokers do take a cut, as does the network itself...

Of course, not doing anything is also an action of its own.  I'm aware that Bitcoin is a thing, and therefore my actions or lack thereof are decisions I am making in the market.

I don't have much to invest. BTC for me is a store of value, but I don't have that value yet. It can go up another $2,000 and it's an increase of less than 50%. That's why I'm using alts with enough room to grow 10x or even 100x in 2-3 years to make money, then move a big chunk of that to BTC.;1;0;False;quirotate;dmg6iqu;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg
"**Network effect**

A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the effect described in economics and business that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it.

The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.

"Actually that's not what a Ponzi scheme is at all lol.

What I'm saying is that the entire reason bitcoin is valued at higher than a few cents is because people believe it will be worth more dollars in the future than it is today.  Bitcoin, as it stands now, is being used much much more as a speculative asset than it is a currency and is the predominant reason it's seen such an amazing run in price in the last year or so.

Because they act as custodian for the funds, you don't actually pay a mining fee until you transfer into your own wallet. That with their fee being percentage based means that it shouldn't matter how little you buy. Just wait until you have enough to justify the mining fee before you transfer it to another wallet. I've never bought small amounts from them though (<$100), so not sure if there is a different price structure below some threshold.;1;0;False;gl904;dmh719n;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg

"I thought this sub was all about the ""store of wealth"" philosophy not the ""replacement for cash"" philosophy. (Which is that other sub)

World Economic Forum predicts $10 Trillion market cap for crypto and blockchain tech combined in ten years. 

If that is believable then the question becomes what percentage of that is bitcoin. If we say 10% that's 10x growth over current levels. 

So ten years not two, by that model, but that's still insane growth.

Or, it should be. 

Once we have mined all, or practically all, of the coins we will enter a deflationary cycle. 

I guess I was pointing out that even though bitcoin is still in an inflationary stage, more coins are being added to circulation, it is going up in value despite it. 

And more subtlety I'm asking what might happen when we stop mining more coins, and enter a true and total deflationary period. 

I really can't say, and I'm not sure it's even a good thing.
