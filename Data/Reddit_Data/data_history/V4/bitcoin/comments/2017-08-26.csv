"Eileen Ormsby is a respected writer & well-known journalist. She's a public figure, whose reddit moniker ""OzFreelancer"" is perhaps even more recognizable than her own name. She covered Silk Road at length and I would dare say that she is an authority on the subject.

In fact ... she wrote a book about it. That book.

I ended up in this thread by following one of Eileen's links. I couldn't stop reading. Is this what it's like when we're talking about bitcoins? I've never hung out with the BTC crowd. Are you all like this? Narrow-minded, autistic reactionaries?";1;0;False;JohnTSchmitz;dm5vbvi;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
"No. They didn't. Ever. Not even a little. Child pornography was strictly forbidden on Silk Road, along with any items designed to cause harm or defraud.

Whether listings for small arms should be allowed or not was a matter of debate; DPR supported it, so a separate site (The Armory) was established specifically for those listings. After a while, though, The Armory was shuttered. It turns out that no one really buys guns on DNMs. Nobody even asks about them.

Silk Road did not allow the sale of WMDs, poisons, slaves, stolen/hacked accounts, or hitmen. If you find someone offering their services as a hitman on the Dark Web, it won't be on any of the recognized DNMs (none left, really), nor would it have been on Silk Road. It's a scam, anyway. They will take your money ... but they won't kill anyone. It's not a thing. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. You might as well spend your time answering emails from Nigerian princes and wiring money overseas.

And no child porn. Not on Silk Road, nor on any other DarkNetMarket, past or present. Child porn and those who deal in it are universally vilified & shunned by the DNM community. You won't find one person who would have anything to do with it.

Is there child pornography on the Dark Net? Yes. There are specific sites that specialize in it—it's all they do—because no one anywhere else will allow it or abide it in any way.

And since none of you in this thread seem to know the first thing about the Deep Web, the Dark Net, DarkNetMarkets, or even elementary-level civics, let me be clear: A hidden service that hosts child pornography is not a DarkNetMarket (DNM); it is a ""pedo site.""

The Deep Web is not indexed by search engines. Most of it is benign. Think ugly web pages and lots of computer code. Part of the Deep Web is referred to as the Dark Net. It's a very boring place, but serves its purposes. It only has a few:

1. DarkNetMarkets. Silk Road comes to mind. You can (could) buy drugs with cryptocurrency such as bitcoin. This is what everyone comes for. It's friendly and not really a scary place. Infrequent scams, lots of happy customers. Lately lots of law enforcement, scams, arrests, etc. The DNM scene should be in vacation mode or on a permanent hiatus, but that's neither here nor there. NO CHILD PORN.

2. Pedo sites. FINALLY. This is where the child porn goes. And the pedophiles. Those are the only two things that you will find on a pedo site. (And undercover LEO, which is great, because even Ross Ulbricht likes to see child molesters busted & put behind bars.) Pedo sites are not Silk Road; they are not DarkNetMarkets.

3. Sites & boards having to do with gore, fetishes, and all things legal-but-lame. For kooks ... but often frequented by curious tourists who are trying to find all the hitmen and SCUD missiles that they heard about in _NewsWeek_. They end up here because they don't know what they're looking for or what the hell they're doing. Actual denizens of the Dark Net are there for a specific reason—they know where they are going and what they're going to do when they get there. If all the tourists leave with is a queasy stomach from watching ""Faces of Death"" clips, then they got off easy ... because the last destination, the LARGEST destination, is....

4. SCAMMER ALLEY! (Not a real place. Never mind. It probably is. Go bananas.) Here you have wikis, phishing links, site clones, malware, bots.... The DNM crowd doesn't feel much better about scammers than they do about pedos. There is some overlap, but not a lot. Legit DNM users don't have any use for scammers and they aren't affected by them. Scammers prey on tourists and the uninitiated—the idiot kids who heard about a web site with drugs from their friend's cousin. It's a blessing really. They should've stayed home and hopefully they won't come back.

So ... where did Silk Road keep the child porn? They didn't. The pedo sites have it all. TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

Incidentally, shouldn't life sentences be given to those predators who kidnap, rape, torture, and even kill children & babies? Ross got 2 life sentences, while Matthew David Graham (Lux, the admin of pedo site Hurt2theCore) got what ... 15 years? He's 23 now, so he'll be leaving prison in the prime of his life. And he will do what he did again & again. People like him cannot be cured or re-habilitated. He should have recieved a life sentence ... or better yet, they should have dragged him out back and strung him up in the nearest tree.

Ross was a nice, intelligent kid. An idealist & naive, perhaps. For a kid his age, his lack of foresight & levels of complacency were about right. A certain amount of gullibility was working against him, to be sure. He liked pot & psychedelics & a good party. Wouldn't wear a shirt, though. A reader, a dreamer, and a computer screener. He was no kingpin criminal mastermind. He was a marshmallow. Well ... an Eagle Scout, anyway.

Seriously. He was.

He was fed to the wolves by an actual arch villain—the same one who is still steering the boat to this day.

But Ross didn't sell child porn, you goddamned dunce.";1;0;False;JohnTSchmitz;dm5ujbp;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

I'd imagine if the computer was used somewhere after the fact then the odds are nearly zero, if it's sitting in a dump since OP last used it and nobody used it (and potentially wrote over the sections of the drive multiple times) then it's entirely possible. Since they're HDDs at the time most likely, if the file was even deleted cyber forensics people or whatever they call themselves could potentially recover the wallet information.;1;0;False;;dm5454y;The original Bitcoin faucet used to give away 5 whole bitcoins;6vsmyu;https://i.redd.it/pkpiy0rt4qhz.jpg
"People are people... if there is a means by which something can be adopted for criminal means, so it will be done. This is the way it has always been and always will be as long as humans walk the earth. That may sound pessimistic... it's not, it's just reality. I am confident such issues will be tackled in their own way, but obviously there is concern there, and it will never be fully resolved, no more than it has been with traditional fiat. What impact any such attempts to 'police' Bitcoin may have on its value, who knows... it may crash, only to recover once more, or it may have none. No doubt that the community at large would welcome any solution if its criminal use proliferates out of control. No one has a crystal ball. HOWEVER, it is wrong to say Bitcoin's only or predominant use currently is for such purposes. That is factually incorrect. The vast majority of Bitcoin use is perfectly legitimate. Criminal enterprise, while significant, does not account for the majority of Bitcoin transactions. There are actually more anonymous cryptos than Bitcoin which may become favoured by criminals in the future anyway, so it could all be moot.

There is much excitement around Bitcoin because of the rapid value increase yes... that's to be expected. We are in that crazy exciting period, but that will eventually pass. Bitcoin will not increase in value ad infinitum... one day it WILL settle. No one gets excited about gold in that way, obviously, because it's more stable. That will eventually happen with Bitcoin. There will come a day where people who weren't here at this time will look back on all this fervor and excitement with curiosity and puzzlement. So yes, if you frame things a very specific way, it may APPEAR that everything about Bitcoin revolves around its value increase... but that's not the TOTALITY of what Bitcoin is, nor does it have anything to do with what it has the POTENTIAL to become.

I actually don't see Bitcoin replacing traditional fiat, not in my lifetime anyway... I think it can happily co-exist, along with other cryptos. We're just in crazy times at the moment... the infancy of it all, so there are lots of unknowns and road ahead will no doubt be a bumpy one.

Our attitude toward money is the problem, not the money (or Bitcoin) itself. Money, and by extension Bitcoin or any other crypto, asset or commodity, is morally neutral... it’s the love of money that gets us in to so much trouble.

Gold backed crypto has counter party risk. You have to trust that the company claiming to hold the gold actually does hold it and you have to worry about them being able to keep it safe from nefarious actors such as thieves or corrupt governments. With Bitcoin you the coins are in your possession and are far easier to secure and transport compared to gold. ;1;0;False;xcsler;dm4w3ew;The original Bitcoin faucet used to give away 5 whole bitcoins;6vsmyu;https://i.redd.it/pkpiy0rt4qhz.jpg

Except Satoshi seemingly purposefully didn't use the keys that the NSA recommends for the SHA 256 that he uses.
