"I'll take that to mean you agree with the points I've presented (or can't think of any counterargument), yet don't like what is implied by the facts. Sad.

This is the problem with, not only this subject, but the whole of Reddit and, on a larger scale, all social media. It's not a place to find information and intelligent discussions supported by facts and research, it's a place to find regurgitated memes, infographics and people blindly accepting what they see as fact.

This is the age of misinformation, not information.

I can find a plethora of information supporting any point of view. I can turn that into misleading charts and put a caption supporting my beliefs or desires... and poof! It's fact.

*How about not judging anything based on one single factor* and instead looking at the whole picture. There's likely a reason this thread in particular loves to use the phrase ""don't look at."" To me that would be a clear indication that there's far more evidence to the contrary of the popular oppinion.

This may be an extreme, but take Hitler for example. I could list a hundred things that would make him seem to have been the greatest leader in German history- after all, there's a reason he was Time Magazine's ""Man of The Year"" in 1939. By neglecting to take all the facts into account I've done something no better than blatantly lying. And worse, telling people to not consider the bigger picture, and instead consider a single piece of data taken out of context, you're in essence telling people not to make their own judgement based on all available information.

Reddit would be a far better place I'd subs meant to be platforms for discussion were not simply a place for supporters of the topic to to verbally felaciate each other.";1;1;False;Nycmdthroaway;eepo5fg;Judge bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs.;abznev;https://i.redd.it/3n7l1vlmp3821.jpg
