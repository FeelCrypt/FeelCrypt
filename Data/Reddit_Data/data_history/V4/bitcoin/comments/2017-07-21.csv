Well, say you spend 30k to get 10 bitcoins because that is the current price. If you instead waited and got in when bitcoin dropped to 2k, you would be able to get 15 coins instead of 10.

"Uncertainty is always a death sentence for any security. BIP 91 locking in gets rid of a whole lot of uncertainty.

Bit coin especially is susceptible to it since it's so new and there's so much sckepticism in the mainstream finance world.

2017 July 21 10:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch closes with >80% signaling and BIP91 locks-in

2017 July 23 18:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch finishes, BIP91 is activated

2017 July 23 18:00 GMT onward — Every block signals BIP141 (Segwit)

2017 July 27 or thereabouts — New Difficulty Adjustment Period Begins (2016 blocks). Every block will be signaling for Segwit.

2017 August 1 00:00 GMT — BIP148 starts, but does nothing since every block is signaling BIP141 due to BIP91.

2017 August 10 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes with >95% signaling and BIP141 locks-in.

2017 August 23 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes and BIP141 (Segwit) is active.
