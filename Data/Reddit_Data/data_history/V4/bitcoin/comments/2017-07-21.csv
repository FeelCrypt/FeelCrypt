Well, say you spend 30k to get 10 bitcoins because that is the current price. If you instead waited and got in when bitcoin dropped to 2k, you would be able to get 15 coins instead of 10.

"Uncertainty is always a death sentence for any security. BIP 91 locking in gets rid of a whole lot of uncertainty.

Bit coin especially is susceptible to it since it's so new and there's so much sckepticism in the mainstream finance world.

""wow granddad, Bitcoin was only $2500 when you were a kid? Man you're ollllllld""
