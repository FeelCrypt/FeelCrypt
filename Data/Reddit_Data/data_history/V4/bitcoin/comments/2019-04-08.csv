">You seem to think that this also means that Z=90%, but it doesn't.

I said the opposite of this multiple times . There is no way Richie will pay 70% or 99%. **There is no way you can get the top 3% to even pay 90% of the total income taxes.**

I am making no such assumptions and what you are saying completely misses the point of the discussion. 

Taxing greater than 42% for anyone effectively is extremely difficult for states to collect, which is why social democracies are forced to heavily tax everyone where the poor and middle class pay most of the entitlement programs.

>Pretty big difference there.

Not really much of a difference because whether you tax the wealthy 70% or 99% you will not be able to collect those rates and even if you could magically collect those taxes from the wealthy (not going to happen) they cannot pay for the proposed massive entitlement programs some are suggesting. The math simply does not add up.

I keep seeing this lie being repeated by young and naive people in the USA... just tax the wealthy more , just tax the corporations more when all they have to do is see that their favorite countries heavily tax the poor and middle class in Scandinavia and entitlement programs are over extended and going to have a huge problem due to low childbirth rates.

again, thats *all income taxes*

They replied saying

Clearly still referring to a percentage of all income taxes.

Then you jump to the wild conclusion that they are saying we need 90% income tax on the rich. No, you are twisting words to sound more outlandish than they actually are.

.

But maybe you just don't understand how percentages actually work, I know many people struggle to understand them.

You are focused on the percentage referring to the amount taken, while it is clearly the percentage of all total taxes in the country.

Let's break it down. Richy Rich has X dollars. The total tax paid by everyone in the whole country is Y dollars. Z is the tax rate that Richy will pay.

Are you still following?

The ideal situation we should have is

X * Z = Y * 90%

Thanks for the great example of anti-intellectualism. Your spurious comparison of modern scientists to priests is just bad. You can't fact check a priest because... God. Scientists get countered and refuted or backed up and confirmed by other scientists, informed citizens, and new data. While many of us dogmatically adhere to a scientific method, there is no scientist held above repeatable experimental results and hard data (if you have an example of one feel free to share). The very definition of science is open thinking because our beliefs are dictated by whichever way the data leads us, superstition does not lend itself to open thinking, though it does not absolutely preclude it either.  ;0;1;False;FockerCRNA;ekchrqe;Carl Sagan's Prophecy From 1995 Is Scary Accurate;bajfbs;https://i.redd.it/xbe1kimgyvq21.jpg

"The broadcast media has been focusing the public debate over the functioning of the institutions that run society away from substance and informative commentary and toward ungrounded emotional argumentation.  This allows the few people who still understand what is really going on to pursue unholy agendas to enrich themselves at the public's expense, or to gather mob power unto themselves to justify things that would never fly if the broader public was clued in.

The connection to bitcoin is to focus this point on the banking system.

While I agree with Sagan's point about how the broadcast media operates, I think that social media (and more broadly the internet) have more than picked up the slack in educating the public about how its institutions actually function.  In fairness to Sagan, the internet was too small in 1995 for this effect to be observable then.

I think there are more people who understand how the fiat banking system works in detail, thanks to bitcoin and the twitter / youtube / reddit commentary around it, than there ever were in the 20th century (in absoulte numbers, or as a fraction of the population).

I also think that the rise of the software industry has distributed the detailed knowledge of how the various institutions of society work.  Think of how many programmers work in the finance industry.  I used to.  That was how I learned about credit card authorization and settlement procedures in detail.

So even though there is little manufacturing in the sense of workers on an assembly line, the knowledge of how the industrial base around us works is much more widely distributed thanks to the armies of programmers required to write the software to keep things running.";4;0;False;SilencingNarrative;ekeal2k;Carl Sagan's Prophecy From 1995 Is Scary Accurate;bajfbs;https://i.redd.it/xbe1kimgyvq21.jpg
