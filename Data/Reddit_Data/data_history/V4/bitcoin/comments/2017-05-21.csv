Thats awesome to hear I am glad I have introduced you to this wonderful world of BTC. You're thinking of it exactly as it should be, BTC wont ever be a replacement for cash and most likely wont even become a primarily used form of payment. Although its uses as a digital commodity are endless. For example, if I wanted to send my leftover money to family in another country at the end of a year it could cost immense amounts in fees and exchanges if done through traditional methods. BTC would allow me to move any amount of value, instantly, for a fraction of the fee. The problem right now is converting currency to BTC back to currency without accumulating the same fees but I foresee a future where this problem  is trivial. All BTC needs to surmount this problem is a little bit more adoption and ease of use. Not to mention capabilities like being able to send and receive funds anonymously or being able to take irreversible payments with no middle-man involved whatsoever. There is a definite market and use for this technology, it just hasn't been properly implemented yet.;2;1;False;3nelsoa;dhu7btp;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.

Kind of. Bitcoin has slow block generation compared to other cryptos. About every 10 minutes a new block is published. This means to get a few confirmations on a spend it can take 30-40 minutes for it to be a valid spend. Introduction of segregated witness which is coming soon will introduce lightning networks and off chain transactions that will confirm instantly. So it wont be this way forever.;3;0;False;3nelsoa;dhudsur;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.;6cbzg1;https://i.redd.it/cc4ig0pmapyy.jpg

It's a reasonable suggestion, but I really wouldn't forgive myself if I missed yet another opportunity and wasted half of my newest bitcoins for a few thousands of € I don't really need. I bought my first bitcoins in February of 2012, owned enough that I would've been able to buy a house with them today had I not spent most of them, sold some and lost some to Mt.Gox. I think that I'm just going to do what I should have done years ago and hold regardless of what happens. Not adding more regrets to the pile is worth more than the money I could earn right now. I might put 1000 new € in an exchange to play the buy low sell high game with though.;3;2;False;Exotemporal;dhtpk5e;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.

"That would mean it would have to go a 50% down.

I think the last time that happened was thanks to Mt. Gox, so unless there is some other exchange stealing a big chunk of the coins in circulation, it isn't probable to happen.

The other possibility would be to get definitive proof of the scaling issues being unsolvable, which would more likely tank the value altogether and you wouldn't really like to hop on that train, would you? However it rather seems like the scaling issues are being proven totally solvable, so this is also an unlikely scenario.

Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that what's going on right now totally looks like a bubble on its own, but it also isn't all that far from how bitcoin ""should"" actually scale.";2;0;False;jarfil;dhum4v5;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.;6cbzg1;https://i.redd.it/cc4ig0pmapyy.jpg

"You could but I am really just guessing. Making educated guesses after hours and hours and reading but we are all guessing. There are a lot of crypto analysis and signal blogs that know more than I do but I like sticking to the basics. Right now I'd recommend to buy and hold like everyone else on this sub would say. I saw this because the activation of segwit is going to be a big deal and could increase the overall liquidity of BTC tremendously. One of the most valued qualities of an asset or commodity in the study of finance is how liquid said asset is so I wouldn't be surprised if $3000 is reached shortly after its activation. If there is a hard fork this august though we could see some price turmoil so if you're a play it safe kind of guy wait out till we see what kind of effect that brings.

Also, usually after sharp increases in price like this there is some sort of correction. So again, if you like to play it safe wait for some sort of correction to buy, but it is impossible to know when the bottom said correction will be. In the past I have purchased if 4 of the last 5 days have closed below where they open. That being said, I'm not sure if we will see as mighty of or any correction this move as previous comparable moves have had. This is mainly due to the overall sentiment about BTC and cryptos in general right now and the simple fact that BTC has seen a pretty steady climb ever since **September of 2015**. Or this movement could end at 3000 and the correction could bring us to 2500, still well above the current price level.

If you are willing to take a little risk buy now and HODL. Don't try to play the game because even if we see some major corrections back to $1000 and you have made big losses, BTC hasn't nearly reached it potential and maximum user base yet. It's still incredibly difficult to understand and use for the general person. Most large retailers aren't ready to mess with it yet. Most governments haven't decided how they are going to handle an electronic commodity. Most banks aren't even considering how to handle integration of BTC. In my opinion BTC has a very long ways to go still. You can be like the rest of the cool kids that bought at $300 in 3 years when the price could quite possibly be in the 10's of thousands, if you believe that BTC has fundamental worth as a technology. Coins are just going to continue to get more scarce naturally because of the set monetary policy of mining and adoption can only increase or quit altogether. Personally I don't see much middle ground so it is pretty much an all or nothing bet with pretty good odds.

The largest risk you take is some sort of catastrophic failure, but given the amount of support this specific crypto has the probability of that is highly unlikely. I can only see the cause of such failure to be stagnation in development and the rise of some altcoin.

tldr;
Buy and hold. See all the low points in the future, because there is probably going to be low points, not as losses but as opportunities to get deeper invested for less. Only do this is you think BTC has fundamental value, though, and real world application in the future.";9;1;False;3nelsoa;dhu0l8z;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.

"It's a common misconception that large well funded miners make more returns (% ROI, not absolute ROI) than small miners. In fact the opposite is true. A guy with a single 1 kW miner in his house won't incur some cost overheads that large miners *have* to have (data center building, labor, etc). The main factor determining your success will be your electricity cost, not your size. What *is* true though is that large professional miners will make the effort to establish their mining operation where electricity is cheap, whereas a small miner has to pay whatever rate his household is charged.

Ethereum is pretty interesting. The incredibly fast blocks aim to tackle the problem of long confirmations that we see in BTC. On top of that it could be more resistant to mining giants since the proof of work algorithm is memory based instead of computation based. One of my concerns with this proof of work systems, though, is that it doesn't use a proportional amount of electricity like the computational approach BTC takes. Lots of very innovative ideas behind ethereum, though, and they definitely seem to be directly trying to find solutions the main issues that BTC struggles with.

"Make yourself a set game plan like a professional trader would do, if you have disposable income. Something along the lines of 

-if price drop 20% below the current high purchase some coin

-if the value is 30% higher than your average buy in rate, sell half your coins

-if there is good news for bitcoin (such as segwit activation or other technology developments) buy

-if there is bad news for bitcoin (such as Mt gox, community disagreements, uncertainty/fear from forks) sell

And so on. This way you don't have to make decisions as you go and the human element is removed. If you feel like it you can even add in more advanced indicators such as oscillators or stochastic or even the crossing of fast and short moving averages to signal buys and sells. You can dial your plan enough so that you only make transactions every few days to months depending on your style. Trading BTC off fundamentals isn't too difficult, but quite unpredictable due to the volatility. Start off with what is a small amount of money to you and as you get addicted you can increase the stakes. And if you end up enjoying trading actively there are options to trade on leverage and open short positions; although I am not aware if any platforms offer leverage trading with reasonable fees.

One of the main factors of price action in BTC (in my opinion because its obviously impossible to know) is mainstream adoption and integration for payment methods. Right now the technology is a little rough for day to day small transactions but it is totally acceptable for things like online purchases or digital content. What there is no doubt about, is that BTC has leagues and fathoms to go in the realm of mainstream adoption. This is ultimately why I am long BTC, although I totally accept the possibility it dies out completely due to out-performance from an alt-coin or problems with mining/node centralization that cannot be addressed due to how Bitcoin in fundamentally designed. But cryptocurrencies are without a doubt here to stay and will be part of the future, and so far Bitcoin is ""winning the race.""";28;5;False;3nelsoa;dhtq0kq;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.

This is the best Bitcoin investment advice:


[Dollar cost average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) by buying what you can afford to lose every week.

It is always a good time to buy bitcoin if you are holding long term and not just for day trading. Don't wait for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

"$1 still gets you 50,000 satoshis. And when one bitcoin buys $10,000, we'll reach a kind of weird parity where $1 also buys 10,000 satoshis. If that happens, satoshis may start to look like a plausible currency unit.

Fun facts from the Wiki:

>The Japanese character シ (""shi"") has been proposed as a potential currency symbol for the satoshi. The Katakana symbol サ (""sa"") has also been proposed, as it looks more reminiscent of a currency symbol. The circled shi (㋛) has been suggested to disambiguate the symbol from the character, as it is synonymous with death. Additionally, the Hiragana shi (し) is a suggestion.

"Currently there are about 16M BTC in circulation, many of which are probably dead never to be recovered and another good sum held in the wallets of a few early adopters. If BTC were valued at 20k USD right now the network would have a market cap of 360B. Apple's market cap is a massive 800B. BTC could easily reach 20k USD, if it finds itself a useful role in the future of the world. BTC's worth is soley determined of simple supply and demand. Since the supply is finite, continual growth in demand will result in continual growth in price. If it turns out humanity decides it doesn't really need a technology like BTC and we have easier/faster/safer/cheaper/better methods of transfering value then the price will hang out at almost nothing. The price of BTC **right now** is people predicting the worth it will have to a future society. The price of BTC in the distant but foreseeable future will be a direct result of how useful it is to the world. Most the people on the subreddit, like myself, believe that BTC is a very new and powerful technology with lots of benefits to the world. So we don't doubt that someday it will be valued much more than it is right now. If you don't think it will provide much benefit to society then the current price is absolutely absurd.

To put things in a little perspective... The total cap for BTCs mined will be 21M. Just for fun lets say half of those coins are held by people who are using BTC to store worth in the future to avoid inflation. That means that roughly 10M BTC will be in ""circulation"" for use. Even if 20% of the whole world uses BTC in the future that leaves on average .00143BTC per person assuming the worlds population stops increasing today. Let's speculate further and say that on average people who regularly use BTC in the future would like to have about $200 on hand to spend. This would mean the coins would have to be ""valued"" at $140,000 for it to be used like this. Obviously these speculations are incredibly crude but it goes to show what could happen to BTC if it were adopted world wide and the network was capable of supporting this kind of volume. Comparing it to the market cap of some company is pointless because companies are privately controlled entities where BTC is a decentralized protocol for digital payment. Comparing it to a limited commodity like gold is a much better, but still poor, comparison. It's estimated that there is about 170,000 tons of gold mined above ground. This makes gold's ""market cap"" 6.8*10^12 USD. They exact same concept that gives gold its worth gives BTC its worth, the fact that theres a limited amount and someone will give you money for it. The main difference being one is physical and one is digital. Another difference is that due to the discovery of cryptography we have just recently figured out how to create a limited supply of something digital while maintaining decentralization. So the true ""value"" of BTC is something that can't be know, just speculated.

tldr; BTC could quite possibly reach the 10s of thousands in the coming years or decades. Or it could be worth nothing. Depends completely on if it provides something of worth to humans.";21;4;False;3nelsoa;dhu2uim;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.;6cbzg1;https://i.redd.it/cc4ig0pmapyy.jpg

"It's honestly not that sudden, BTC withstands high volatility ~~most of~~ all of the time. Check out this [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/UYgJD)

We have been on a somewhat linear increase since September of 2015. It is just recently though, that people are realizing this increase probably isn't going to stop soon. As you can see from the picture the current price is well above our little trend, so I would say its not unlikely for us to return to the 1300-1400 range soon. Personally I don't think this little climb is over yet, though, and wont be over any time soon. So it doesn't really matter if we are at a high right now because give it a few months or maybe a year and we will be at a new high. Just like we have been doing for the last two years.

How is this any different from the last astronomical increase you might ask. Well the first major BTC bubble was a lot more dramatic, and one of the most exciting two months of my life as I held about 1.5 BTC. We saw an increase from $15 to $100 in just a couple months, where it hung out for about 4-5 months. Then it ""went viral"" and in two months went from $100 to nearly $1200. This time period of growth was not only much shorter and more sporadic than the last two years but currently there is much more awareness and adoption than there was during that burst in the end of 2013. These facts are what makes the current evaluation a little bit more accurate and realistic than the December 2013 evaluation ATH of $1200. That first major bubble was followed by nearly two years of price decay in response.

The other major difference to me is the November/December 2013 jump was primarily due to the discovery and spread of BTC to the masses. I think a good portion of the current price jump is anticipation to the release of segwit and the blocksize increase that will come with it. These developments in the protocol will heavily increase the liquidity of BTC and with that we will hopefully see more adoption leading to ever more price increases. The recent jump in price is people who want to get in early before the real hype comes on.

Just my opinion though, its extremely difficult to apply an intrinsic value to something like BTC because it is just a protocol. So all the people who are long BTC such as myself could easily be overvaluing the technology and the next few years could be another stagnation period for BTC.";2;2;False;3nelsoa;dhu1kh5;$2000!!
