It's not a point. It's a retarded statement. You obviously can't compare raw numbers of hashes for different algorithms and conclude that the one is way less secure than the other cuz the number is lower. If that were not so, and this guy was correct, ethereum would already have been 51% attacked, cuz you'd need like 5 Asics to do it.  OBVIOUSLY you couldn't do that. Soooo obviously. If he thought for 3 seconds before posting that he probably wouldn't have. That's like thinking a stock's market cap is low because it's $1 a share without taking into account number of shares.

"**Behavioral economics**

Behavioral economics, along with the related sub-field behavioral finance, studies the effects of psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and the consequences for market prices, returns, and resource allocation, although not always that narrowly, but also more generally, of the impact of different kinds of behavior, in different environments of varying experimental values.

Risk tolerance is a crucial factor in personal financial decision making. Risk tolerance is defined as individuals' willingness to engage in a financial activity whose outcome is uncertain.

Behavioral economics is primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents.

Gotta ask these questions before you make an investment or you are just gambling blind in a game that you don’t understand. I have large holdings in other projects that I know will yield dividends in the near future and continue to pay out. Btc is a straight store of value at this point but the volatility can test your hands big time. 

I hold bitcoin because it’s very possible that the value will increase exponentially. I would look elsewhere for diversification if you think blockchain is the future. ";6;1;False;ii_OiO_ii;dso6fqg;Hodling now feels like...;7qbeie;https://v.redd.it/bbwqz5fzq0a01

Anyone who's ever invested a penny in anything has bought into an overpriced position.  Some people realize early and get out with little to no harm.  Others have the patience to see it through.  A few feel resentment and self loathing for having made a badly informed decision that cost them money.  Those few learn from their mistake by questioning why their entry price was unreasonable.

"**Potato**

The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. The word ""potato"" may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, some other closely related species are cultivated. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.
