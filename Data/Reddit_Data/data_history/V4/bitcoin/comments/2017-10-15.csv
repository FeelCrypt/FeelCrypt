"I remember back in 2012,when I was just fourteen, me and a good friend of mine became very curious about Bitcoin, and decided to invest some of our hard earned money in it. Worked a couple of weeks for the shittiest tips, spent all the money on cards and pizza, and repeated the process a couple of times. We never took the chance in the end. We laughed about it a year later, saying that we definitely should work and do it again, while both knowing what the results of our hard work would be. 

As a result, we totally forgot about it,cause he later had lung cancer, and passed away in February last year. He was an extremely optimistic person, who died young, too young. I still mourn him to this day.

The whole point of this comment, was that I recently heard my sixteen year old brother talking about Bitcoin and how he wanted to invest in it,and it's been a while since I saw him so excited for something. But nothing hurts me more than the memory of one happy moment, that ended up as a best friend being buried under my eyes. 
Wishing the best to all investing it, I'm just letting out something that I thought was too stupid to tell anyone else

"Personally, right now, I am leaving mine on btcpop. But really it depends on what you want to do. 
 
There are hardware wallets, paper wallets, and online wallets. There was a time where I was burning up hard drives, and am personally not a fan of them.

Even paper wallets are dangerous, but likely the safest of them all, for portability.

Coinbase... really shouldn't be trusted, considering they haven't given the btcc. But then, none of the companies who didn't give you the btcc should be trusted... btcpop has my money sitting in an interest bearing account, and I got my btcc.

I used 0 to indicate it's inception. Wasn't thinking you'd be this butthurt to nitpick about that (btw it started trading more closely to 500 initially). The fact is, it went from not existing to 900 in 3 weeks. And since then it has been in a steady downward trend, if you can't find a simple trend on a chart then you're hopelessly delusional. 7 days ago it was trading at 350, that is a 15% loss in a week.

"**Lightning Network**

The Lightning Network is a proposed solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. The software uses an off-chain protocol and is currently in alpha phase of development. It features a P2P system for making micropayments of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Vertcoin through a scale-free network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds or trust to third parties.

It is expected that normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant blockchain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the blockchain, followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.

"Wrong. If everyone is prosperous, absent currency manipulation, that means everyone has increased production. That means prices will go down because goods, and services are more plentiful. 

You are conflating wealth, with money.

Gas, and computers. Fuel prices dropped with the invention of fracking greatly increasing the production of existing wells, computers get smaller, faster, and cheaper according to Moore's law on technology progress.

Deflations in modern times are almost always caused by credit contractions, and inflations by printing excess money, or deficit spending by government.

Generally it takes a mature market to crash an economy. The more mature the market that's is crashing the further the fall. The housing market caused such a big dip because it was a mature market that reached into every corner of the economy as a result of exotic debt products and possibly too much regulation in some aspects. Even if Wall Street gets involves now and crash it the size of the market would limit the damage. Look how many years Wall Street was involved in the housing market before they screwed it up. I agree that they will eventually screw it up but it wont be overnight and it wont be anything like the housing bubble or even the coming soverign debt problems. Wall Street will start out trading crypto for themselves and clients but when the market matures and returns level off they will start rolling out debt/credit instruments and other crazy stuff simply to gain alpha that is when it's time to jump ship but until then enjoy the rocket ride.

"MySpace was ubiquitous but annoying. Awful backgrounds and endless animated gifs. Then Facebook came along with its clean, non-customizable look and a focus on creating a feed for you instead of your friends.

Bitcoin is ubiquitous but annoying. Slow transfers. Endless drama. And technically unable to actually be a world currency due to the pinch point that is a blockchain.

And then along comes IOTA's tangle, which is completely user focused. No fees, scaling only limited by bandwidth, and it gets faster as more people use it.

Bitcoin is a long ways from dead, but its time is limited. When we reach the point that people are wanting to actually use crypto and not just speculate on it, people aren't going to put up with the limitations blockchains, at least as far as currency goes.";16;4;False;RevMen;doe1886;Waiting for the Bitcoin bubble to burst.;76flwd;https://i.redd.it/xsvh37tatvrz.jpg

"Here is the thing. Any one government bans bitcoin, and they risk putting their country at a huge disadvantage to the rest of the world. Sure all politicians would like to ban it, but few will risk trying for fear of the backlash when they find themselves living in a third world country. Throw into that mix the desire of many countries to break the dominance of the USD, and you start to get a picture of why politicians of the world are never going to unite in banning bitcoin.

The genie is out of the bottle, and the politicians damn well know it!

BTC for $500k will give a market cap of about 8 trillion dollars which gives nearly same cap as the world supply of gold. If thinking larger we have the worlds total money supply on about 80 trillion dollars (coins, cash bank accounts, checks etc). When comparing this number then 8 trillion dollars is not much.

Yeah I think you're right. If you look at the posts back in '13 when the price was $1k everyone said it will be $5k soon. We are seeing that irrational exuberance again. But bubbles can be irrational longer than you can be rational. 

It's not sustainable but the question is until when? I think we are a long ways from bitcoin going mainstream because it really isn't easy to use.

And so, if I put in $5k and it goes to 100 or 500, I will be laughing then.

But, I'm spreading around to some other coins as well.  I find particular promise in Monero.  BTC was the Silk Road exchange medium back in the day because it offered some anonymity.  When Silk Road busted, BTC fell and returned later.

Monero is quite a bit more anonymous and with each new Silk Road that opens, dealers are either trading in Monero or else laundering their BTC in Monero exchanges.

Yeah it makes you question what it would take for there to be a serious and prolonged regression in price.

"Bitcoin and similarly Litecoin are the only coins (worth mention) that solely focus on the purity of their blockchain. Coins like Etherium are amazing with tokens being added in their blockchain although it creates massive bloat. Their developers are trying to resolve that issue at the moment. Etherium is so young compared to Bitcoin although performance for the same task and blockchain size are ridiculously larger.

http://bc.daniel.net.nz/

Bitcoin is also releasing sideloaded blockchains that will create the ability to use similar token software, without creating any bloat on the core blockchain. This alone will devalue all other tokens as the Bitcoin processing power is exponentially higher than any other protocol. 

Also the fact it's ""not really anonymous"" isn't a bad thing at all. It has certain drawbacks, but for governments and companies who want to tax you, it's a good thing. I'm not talking about centralising the coin, although you can prove transactions for legal purposes. In that sense, it's more likely to receive approval by vendors and governments.

"Gratulations. One of the first people that actually posts something that makes me believe he has seen a mania style bubble before. All those ""oh, it is too high"" - no, it is not. Everyone says it is in a bubble, so per definition it is not. Plus, hardly anyone that matters owns any - so far it is not an asset that every fund ""must have some"".

Next year we will see the inflow of institutional capital. Then the thing will go up - brutally. It will tremendously overreact - no idea where, but anyone thinking it could go to a million... no, it can go a lot higher because noone wants to sell, then suddenly it goes down a little and next day starts crashing.

For the real bubble, we will need ""everyone in"". This will take a lot of time. You will need taxidrivers (plural - there always IS one that does trading or something in reality and justhas a bad streak so he drives taxi) telling you they really are crypto traders or investors, you need funds bousting about the high profit they made with crypto (that is funds, large - so far we have two small ones, and we have one fund manager that made a great trade in ether with his own money -> this does not even show up on the radar as participation). You need everyone in, and then the bubble will burst.

And yes, saying something like ""80% crash BACK TO $500k"" is not unrealistic. We can talk about 200k, 500k or whatever flow - but that is the bubble we can expect. And yes, if an 80% drop puts the high at 2.5 million per coin - that is not unrealistic. Remember, in a real mania bubble - noone will want to sell, and noone cares about valuation. This means the price can go up into totally crazy territory. Until it crashes.

I personally have a long term BTC spending plan that goes into effect starting 2019. And I have ""emergency spending points"" above one million that basically say ""drum X BTC there and diversify into 'hard' assets like land"".

This will be INSANE. You have not seen anything. And you will likely not see anything like this.

I have missed the 87 crash, I have seen the lumber spike, I made a lot of money in the 2000 bubble (and lost a lot). Bitcoin will dwarf them all. This will be the delusion of a generation.

Now, I am NOT saying it is worthless, ponzi - there is real value here, and as you say, it will crash down to some high 6 digit figure. But the bubble will be the delusion of a whole generation, a once in 100 years thing.

"Exactly this.

Up until this point that was the case. If bitcoin is falling it is too risky to invest in. If its rising its too expensive.

However this is the first time in bitcoins short history that a sharp rise has lasted more than a few weeks. This rise has been ongoing for atleast 6 months. Which IMO gives these people the confidence that it may not crash this time, plus the time to learn how to buy and store it before being put off by a crash.

This may very well be the begining of a 2 year bull run in bitcoin. Taking us well into the mania phase. We might see prices previously unimaginable within the next 24 months. Before an 80% crash (back to $500,000) and finally some long term stability which will give merchants the confidence to accept btc directly.

This will be the biggest money making opportunity in my life time. And it wont last much longer. Those that havent already bought will miss the boat. Those that buy in 12 months from now will only make a small gain and those that buy in 24 months from now will loose money.

My prediction is we hit $10,000 by the end of the year, then go somewhat sideways for 6 months (bringing in confidence that crashes are a thing of the past) and then spend 18 months rallying non stop up to a few million per btc (insanly overvalued) before we crash and settle at around $500k.

This falls inline with human nature, greed, mania, where btc needs to be to be usable and stable in global commerce.

This will happen and it will blow peoples minds.

My main point is if everyone (the supporters and he haters) think bitcoin is a bubble then it isnt. Im a contrarian investor. It wont be in its final stages of a bubble until everyone thinks it is NOT a bubble. And that will take a few years of never falling prices to be the case.
