"This meme is supposed to be a smart guy. What's smart about this?

And the ""truth"" part adds nothing, you can put that on any meme.

"That got rude quickly. What's up with that?

And at what point did I display any bias?

I just wanted to have a conversation and hear a logical thought out argument for market demand driven by higher fees. Because the original post didn't really make any sense to me. Your main proposition was: ""If there is no fee market there will be no fees for miners and thus little to no hashrate."" Why would lower fees mean lower hashrate? Fees have gone down from around $50 a transaction to $.05 a transaction in the last 6-months but hashrate has gone up from 15E hash/s to 40E hash/s in the same time frame. So your main talking point doesn't even match the data. Wasn't trying to insult you, it was just an argument I never heard before and didn't make sense to me so I was curious to have a discussion about it.";1;0;False;Raster_Eyes;e2cgofx;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png
"Adoption is creeping at about the same rate as always (slowly). I'm not sure why you're trying to narrow its use to just that of a currency, it can be used for much more. It functions as a currency, commodity, security, investment tool/vehicle, settlement system, remittance network, payment processor, etc... all rolled into one. So to look at its adoption you would have to look at its growth in use for all those things, not just in its use as a currency, which so far it hasn't been as successful with as its other uses. But it has definitely seen huge rise in adoption as an investment tool recently. And smaller but still healthy rise in adoption as a settlement system and remittence network.

Its volatility has gone down. It used to have 1000&#37; gains followed by 70&#37; (or more) drops on a yearly basis (sometimes more than once a year even). We've only seen a big price swing like that happen once in the past 4 years.

And I would say that definitely more people trust in it now than they did a year or two ago or more. Since November I'm not as sure, but a 6-month time frame is pretty short sighted for an asset most people currently view and use as a long term investment asset. It is now regularly discussed on mainstream financial investment television shows. Mainstream financial firms are looking at it much more seriously now also. Governments are taking it much more seriously and are actually making moves towards better regulation. ETF approval looking closer than ever. And many other signs that it is gaining trust and credibility in the mainstream, but it would honestly make this post way too long. And it already is too long, lol.";1;0;False;Raster_Eyes;e2chcqg;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png
