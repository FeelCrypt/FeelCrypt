It's probably true. I did end up buying $50 worth when it was around $110/btc and never sold. Ended up exchanging it over to ETH through Coinbase when they first brought it one board and am damn glad I did.

"Without being in right at the start the second best place was after the first crash or spike. $300 was a very good price to get in at. I almost bought before the first spike but didn't and then again bookmarked at $200 after the crash but forgot to get a couple thousand worth again! I think we are in the bigger investor phase and will see another crash but nowhere near $200 again so money well invested.

I think currently all are over valued for their current uses, functions and limitations. Litecoin might have legs with segwit and adoption by exchanges. xrp and eth I'm unsure on but after a bitcoin crash might be big winners long term.

Once this current frenzy of buying is over I'm putting in my couple of grand but I'm hoping for a scandal which will come it's just a matter of time.";2;0;False;TriSamples;dihm87a;Man buys $27 of bitcoin, forgets about them, finds they're now worth $886k | Technology;6fd6ne;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/09/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home

"Ether is *more* risky than bitcoin.

- It is much more complicated and thus more likely to contain undiscovered exploits.

- Its inflation/deflation schedule is entirely undecided.

- They are trying to move to a PoS system, which is a major change to the very core of Ethereum.

- They are extremely centralized, which puts adopters at the whims of the dev team.

Ethereum classic solves some of these problems, but not all of them.

"Because there are multiple routes to centralization:

- Node centralization

- Miner centralization (really a specialized case of node centralization)

- Developer/leadership centralization

Ethereum's leadership is far more centralized than Bitcoin's, owing to the fact that its inventors are still active participants whose word is valued more than other opinions. They have some authority as a result.

Although to be fair, the current state of bitcoin's mining centralization is a big unknown. Some folks believe that Bitmain is just part of a larger group of allies who have a large dominance over the mining network.

"For all we know Satoshi is still involved in bitcoin development, just not by that name.

What's important is the merit of the idea, not the identity of who published it. So if the authorship may influence public perception of the idea, then the identity of the authors should be hidden.

Satoshi has accumulated a personality cult, and so anything published under that name (assuming it can be proven the authorship is legitimate) would be given a very different treatment than exactly the same thing published by any of the current bitcoin dev personalities.

If Satoshi were still posting under that name, bitcoin would absolutely be more centralized because of the authority people would vest in him. For bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency whose goal is to remove the need for trusted third parties, this sort of leadership centralization is bad, even when the authority is benevolent/genius/defers to community feedback. A benevolent leader sets up the expectation that bitcoin should have a leader in the first place, and opens up the possibility of a future replacement who ends up being a walking disaster.

Satoshi did bitcoin a massive service to us by allowing his authoritative rule over bitcoin to give way to the loose association of bickering devs we have today. And if he's still active under a different name, shit. Props to him for not abusing the name Satoshi to force things through.

That said, there are days I'd wish he'd say something about the scaling debate. I wouldn't even care what method(s) he favored because I'm confident that his conclusions would be well reasoned. But again, that could lead to an expectation of bitcoin having a leader, and we want to avoid that.

"Litecoin just received Segwit less than a month ago and is still in the process of creating their Lightning Network to full scale, which is the part of the software that makes it revolutionary for transactions. At the moment, Bitcoin takes days to confirm and has very high fees. When lightning network is fully implemented, it will take minutes to confirm and the fees are minuscule. 

Companies are already adopting litecoin, in China there are litecoin ATMs. 

Litecoin is at the stage where the technology is there and is still being implemented fully, it is just still growing to the commercial recognition stage. In my opinion, it is more than worthy for any cryptomaniacs investment portfolio. 

Here is my current view of the three main coinbase currencies:

Bitcoin: Store of value

Ethereum: Good for businesses due to blockchain protocol, higher fees than Litecoin

Litecoin: Good for general commercial public and daily spending, quick transactions and low fees.

"This is the correct analogy to have regarding these major coins. Bitcoin being number 1 must have a silver. Litecoin may potentially be that with ethereum attempting to compete with gold as well. But either way they all have their place. In regards to other alt coins treat them as potentials that may boom and may not they are a gamble. Some are safer some are riskier. I could see ripple being valuable for banks but may not have a high end. Where as komodo, monero and saicoin maybe will do better. Time will tell but post August of this year will tell a lot in regards to bitcoin and segwit and the future of crypto and how fast it will progress.

> Typically bitcoins are bought using traditional currency from a bitcoin &quot;Exchanger&quot;, although due to strict anti-money laundering controls, the process can can be tricky.

> A user can then withdraw those bitcoins by sending them back to an exchanger like Mt Gox, the best known bitcoin exchange, in return for cash.

> On 29 October, the world&#039;s first bitcoin ATM also went online in Vancouver, Canada, which scans a user&#039;s palm before letting them buy or sell bitcoins for cash.

As with all investments, there is no guarantee that the price will go up. Bitcoin is a very risky investment (risk=variance of returns). Imo Bitcoin price will go up over the next few years or so. Especially if the scaling issue is resolved soon. If you're looking to invest in crypto, I would highly recommend creating a market weighted portfolio of all of the other cryptos. The other ones show just as much, if not more potential than Bitcoin.
