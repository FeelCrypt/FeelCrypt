The maintenance on old Bentley’s and Rolls Royce’s isn’t discounted though. And that’s why so many older ones aren’t worth the time - many require parts/service exceeding the value of the car.

LPT: if buying ultra premium luxury like Mulsunne or Ghost or watever always buy few years old. Usually same body style and 50-75% off sticker price. Rich people leases ends up in huge discounts.
