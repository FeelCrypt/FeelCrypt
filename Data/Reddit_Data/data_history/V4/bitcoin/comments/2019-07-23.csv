"I believe you, but there must be more to it. How large are these cash deposits (more of a rhetorical question, no need to disclose specifics)? And you're saying cash, as in dollars deposited in person correct? I mean even a small-medium sized retail business could easily generate thousands in cash a day, even more if the products are higher priced with less markup. Jewelry stores in the Diamond District (NYC), regularly make trips at closing to the late night deposit boxes, carrying sometimes hundreds of thousands in cash (off topic, but interestingly, the people entrusted with the duty of making the deposits are pretty much the only people, beaides retired and active NYPD, law enforcement in general, etc., that are granted NYC [concealed] carry permits {long guns are pretty much prohibited except for cops or grandfathered permits, so it's the only way to have a firearm in NYC}, which are almost impossible to get except in very extreme circumstances- which is why almost all armed security/bodyguards in NYC are retired NYPD). But even a busy deli would likely have a few thousand in cash a day for deposit.

Now, I understand that if you linked your account to a Crypto exchange, that would raise red flags- but there would be nothing stopping you from opening a business checking account at a major bank, and then a personal account at a smaller bank that is less technologically advanced (to put it one way), like a local savings bank with a few branches, or a small credit union. Then make your deposits to the business account, set up an auto deposit to the personal account as part of payroll to the personal account- essentially just cutting yourself a regular paycheck (standard procedure for many businesses, depending on structure, more common in Corporations but also in LLCs, especially if there is more than one owner, or just to simplify personal tax liability or to simplify accounting and budgeting). Then use the personal account for exchanges.

You could also have multiple business accounts at multiple banks, make deposits into one, and then get bank checks from them to deposit into your other accounts. Spread out cash deposits over the accounts to keep any one bank from receiving too much cash that it would raise a red flag.

Finally, you can get a foreign LLC, along with a foreign bank account. You could also get a foreign bank account without having a separate foreign business, but with a separate LLC, you would be able to use all the exchanges banned/blocked in the US. I looked into this heavily when I was planning on launching an ICO to fund a project I'm working on, before securing private funding which, while costing me a large share of my company, allowed me to file patents to protect a few critical components of the project. Anyway, a *Cypriot* LLC is the way to go. About €5,000, plus a small yearly maintenance fee, gets you a Cyprus licensed business, a business account at a Bank in Cyprus, and a citizen of Cyprus to act as a ""secretary"" and 0.1% stake holder on paper (required to have at least one stake holder and employee [it's ok if they are the same person] be Cypriot to open a company there). Everything is taken care of by the service and there are several reputable services that are well reviewed and accredited. For a few thousand more euro, you get a full accountant that handles all taxes, business address in a shared office and Cypriot phone number with an answering service (to add legitimacy), and full time support that will handle any issues, guide you through the best practices to keep taxes and exchange fees to a minimum, etc. Cyprus has **_no_ laws whatsoever regulating cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges, ICOs, anything in that domain.** Essentially, you ""contract out"" your Cypriot business (i.e. your US operation hires your Cypriot business for anything you feel makes sense- digital security or IT services are good ones). It is also very easy and relatively inexpensive to wire cash there internationally. You'd be able to make large wire transfers without going through a bank. The service that sets up your business there can take care of receiving and depositing your transfer, and let you know the cheapest way to do it. You would then be able to use any exchange, just use a transparent proxy or a VPN to set your IP.

You could also find someone overseas, and using multisig escrow with a service like bitrated. Have them buy bitcoin and place it in multisig escrow, and then wire them the cost plus a fixed fee or a small percentage, and when he picks up the cash, he releases the escrow. Depending on how much you're paying in in-person exchanges, it might be more cost effective.

I have a Philippine bank account that I used for trading bitcoin when I was heavily vested- now I just use Coinbase, since funding the account in the Philippines was a hassle and became expensive after the dual-Citizen who opened it came back to the states- meaning I could no longer wire the money to her and have her make the deposit in person. But that saved me thousands. Although trying to withdraw the leftover in the account after the holder returned to the US, via an international transfer, cost insane fees, so I left it with a few thousand US in PHP in it. But it's all good, I'm about to need it again, so when she is back in the Philippines in a few months, she'll be traveling with $9,500 and I'll be wiring several thousand more. I'll also (after a couple test runs) be mailing cash to avoid the fees.

Also, do you have dual-use B-ATMs? I mean buy/sell, or just buy? If you can do sell as well, then you can have a semi-self sustaining machine- handing out the cash it takes in.

May I ask what state you're located in? Just curious.";1;0;False;Mypassispass123;euiyzjv;Gave my sister 1 BTC for Christmas in 2013. Got this text yesterday. Warms my heart, so happy for her.;cdkxbx;https://imgur.com/Srj9IBb
I bought in and it grew for a bit before it dropped, then I sold as soon as it dipped just past my breakeven point, so I took a minimal loss, but saved myself a lot of stress. I know the people here will say otherwise, but don't listen to them, they're the people who bought in way earlier and are still in the green after the recent dips, so the volatility doesn't hurt them. It'll hurt you though. Get out. Take your losses and just get out.;1;0;False;Blasco1993;eukjbq2;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg
It’s worth is not tied to USD. You can buy bitcoin with USD from someone willing to sell it and you can buy it in any currency too. If the USD didn’t exists tomorrow bitcoin would still have a value. To get more you’d need to spend local currency on equipment and electricity to mine more. That cost gives it that value. It’s real money alright with a value more directly linked and tied to demand than even USD that can be devalued by over printing or economic prosperity.;1;0;False;TriSamples;eujs4ze;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192
