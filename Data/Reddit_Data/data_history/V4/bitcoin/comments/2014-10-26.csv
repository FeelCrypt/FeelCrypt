"The ATM did work. OP Admitted that it was working and this was logged, but he omitted it from his report. The problem with the kiosk that eventually showed up was that he was using borrowed wifi - that is he was using a public wifi connection that he did not own nor have permission to use. When it failed , the owner of the borrowed wifi did not allow him to log into the router to troubleshoot and basically wanted him off if it. OP tried to blame the ATM software, and when asked to troubleshoot the wifi ( and was refused access ) it was a litany of ' that's not the problem fix your software ' and so on. Eventually OP went and got his own router , but could not figure out how to set it up, and once again went on an angry chew out because no one could help him figure out what to do ( read : could not read the directions ).  Without a working internet connection the ATM could not communicate with the home system. During the troubleshooting process OP was nasty as can be to the techs, citing his technicial prowess and knowedge and basically calling them idiots constantly. This is typical angry customer behavior as anyone who has been in a support role can tell you , but let's be honest. If you can't tell the difference between a hardened windows 7 install and windows XP you probably are not the best and the brightest in the tech world and probably should not be giving lectures down your nose at anyone. Also calling a support tech on their personal cell phone in the middle of the night to tellthem what an idiot they are is not an endearing move. Then the power issues. Someone was killing the power to the ATM. Despite being shown the windows logs indicating unexpected shutdown, this ' was not happening ' acording to the OP. Eventually OP relented and determined on his own that it was a faulty power supply in the computer. Although there was no evidence to support this, an RMA was offered. That was when the great fight between OP and Jordan started. 

The half-posted email about the API keys and the bitcoin exchange? That was the tail end of a long string of explaining that all you chave to do is use copy and paste to copy a string of numbers from one screen to another. I'm no support technician , but even I would become a little terse after having to explain that over and over again. Copy & paste! I saw a demo of how it is done, and if OP could not figure out control C, control V there are larger issues at stake than the robocoin software. 

The only real problem with the ATM was that it suffered from a problem that caused external devices to intermitently not respond to diagnostics. This was a new problem, and it took a while to figure out. By the time the techs at robocoin and the manufacturing site has were able to recreate the problem in their lab ( which is how they were able to work on it while it suposedly was ' in transit'  ) figured out the problem and made a fix it was 'too late'. One thing that OP failed to mention also was that during a remote troubleshooting session while the techs were logged in with an administrative account, OP killed the remote control software and took control of the ATM making changes that he thought were nessicary that only made things worse. This was followed with another litany of abuse and rude behavior towards the techs. 

Again, a few phone calls, a flight to Vegas , some conversation and the truth comes out. It usually does. 

So in summation,

- While OP did have some legitimate gripes about delays and shipping and so on , OP did not make it any easier by his behavior and attitude which he edited out of what he shared, and failed to mention.
- Despite being advised against it used wifi, and borrowed wifi and blmaed robocoin when it failed, then blamed robocoin again when he could not figure out how to configure a router.
- Made unauthorized changes to the ATM in a very sneaky way
- Made several incorrect technicial assessments and decided that he was right and everyone else was wrong
- When presented with an offer to fix things, rejected it
- Violated the contract left and right. ( I have a copy and have read it) 
- Phome bombed people on their personal numbers at all hours of the night.
- Was a ' problem child ' from start to finish with an arrgoant , entitled, down-the-nose attitute towards people. 

To answer what you said : 

It seems that robocoin did deliver a working unit, which worked for a time and then developed issues that were the fault of the OP not being a technically knowledgeable person and doing some questionable things. When an actual problem with the ATM did appear, they did what they could to make good on it , but their offer of an RMA for the part in question was rejected. When the real source of the problem was found that was likewise rejected. 

Now as I pointed out before , does this excuse how Jordan handled it? Not at all. However the clean cut oh poor me I am telling the truth and was a nice person story that OP presented is not as complete nor as true as he would lead you to believe. Did you expect Jordan to come out and say that the OP was rude , nasty, refused help, violated  the contract and was a pain in the ass the entire time? He fell on his sword for his team as he should, and took responsibility without pointing fingers and did what he had to do to end the conflict with a person who was not knowledgable enough to operate the ATM from both a bitcoin and a technicial perspective. 

About reading comments : 
"" You can tell yourself whatever you want to make you feel better about your investment""

But what I said was : 
"" my hesitation to invest right now is not based on their product or the rabble-rousing of one disgruntled customer, but on if the company survives the reddit witch hunt.""  .. I have not invested yet. I still might. 

Now in light of this , do you think that doxing the company employees, inciting threats of physical violence, naming people as crooks, theives, and scam artists, presenting a one sided incomplete story, and knowingly creating a lynch mob fed by disinformation was the correct way to handle it?

"Actually that's not at all what I said.  Read what I wrote:

>  You basically confirmed everything OP said but just don't think it's your responsibility to deal with it

I was skeptical of OP, so I read Jordan's response, so that I had both sides.  Jordan's response, now deleted, confirmed everything OP said, just with a different view on the reasons and who's responsibility it is to resolve them.

In the future, please actually read posts before replying to them, it will save everybody time.";1;1;False;;cljvsel;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub
"In the future, you might want to get the whole story before commenting. See here's the rub : OP committed one of the oldest lies : the lie of omission. What he handed out was a carefully edited version of his side of the story. Naturally Jordan is not going to challenge that in open combat. It would only hurt him more. What Jordan said ( and deleted. Very stupid ) confirmed what OP said in so much as what OP said. The things that OP lied about made ME skeptical, so I did a little digging, which was made easier by OP, and what I found was that OP left out many things  that would make him look bad, edited what he shared , and basically pulled A fast one on reddit. Now Jordan , in true johnny-come-lately-to-business style fumbled the ball like he plays for Dallas but OP failed to tell the whole story and in some cases made exagerated or flase claims. It doesn't take much to find this out. 

Again you are taking OP on faith 'confirmed' by the deleted posting of a scared animal backed into a corner who has just been beaten and is admitting to anything anyone says so that the beatings will stop. Jordan is like a puppy licking the collective hand of reddit and whimpering so that maybe he won't get another crack across the face with a rolled up newspaper. Is he guilty? Of course. He is guilty of being an inexperienced waffling weak handed businessman who pissed off a customer. Is he a criminal? A scam artist? A fly by night robber? No. Is the product complete crap? No. Did OP lie and omit facts about his experience to create an angry mob? You bet. Confirmation? You are reading a he said/she said internet exchange. Me? A few phone calls, a flight to Vegas, a few handshakes and conversations with the people involved, and a few drinks at the bar while contemplating investing in Robocoin. As I said in a comment in the main thread ; my hesitation to invest right now is not based on their product or the rabble-rousing of one disgruntled customer, but on if the company survives the reddit witch hunt. It just makes me sad to see such a tight knit, intelligent, and powerful community acting like a half-cocked lynch mob.

"Since you seem to have all the details, how about you explain then why Jordan never said any of this rather than leaving all of it out and confirming what OP said as the complete story?  If he had all that going for him, why exactly did he post none of it?  It couldn't have been too difficult to produce the rest of the e-mails or to explain the situation in full.  Why did Jordan just say ""yep that's what happened, but I don't think he should blame me for it""....

Then again, I guess I'd try to make myself look good to a potential investor too, and make sure he thought I was the good guy.";1;1;False;;clklcl3;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub
"Jordan's comment confirmed everything OP said, and followed it with along the lines of ""but I don't think most of that is my problem"".  Whatever OP failed to admit, Jordan still admitted that everything he *did* include was true.  You can tell yourself whatever you want to make you feel better about your investment, but the only facts I care about are that Robocoin failed to deliver, all the while saying how it wasn't their problem.

> Confirmation? You are reading a he said/she said internet exchange.

Yeah, and both parties confirmed what happened.  It's not really a he said she said when they both agree about what was said.  Remember, Jordan's comment didn't dispute anything OP said, nor did he, as you claim, say that OP left stuff out.  All the comment was was his view on *why* it happened that was.

> Did OP lie and omit facts about his experience to create an angry mob? You bet.

Please, do tell what OP left out.  I'm all ears about this new information you have found.";1;1;False;;clk5hda;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub
