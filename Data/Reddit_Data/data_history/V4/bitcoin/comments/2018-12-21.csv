Preach brother. I'm down a tonne since last December, I'm still up but marginally. My only condolence is that I haven't lost money yet, and I don't know anyone that has picked a top or a bottom more than once.;1;1;False;cl3ft;ec83l47;Here we go again! Upvote to gain momentum!

"Pro-Bitcoin Ron Paul: It’s Time to Abolish Federal Reserve, Embrace Tax-Free Crypto

Retired US Congressman Ron Paul — a bitcoin skeptic turned proponent — reiterated his calls to abolish the Federal Reserve shortly after it raised the baseline interest rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.

This is the fourth time that the Fed — the central banking system of the United States — raised interest rates in 2018. The move sparked renewed fears of a US recession that could potentially trigger a global recession in 2019.

Ron Paul said the Federal Reserve should let the free market dictate interest rates instead of artificially manipulating them.

“The Fed has NO IDEA what rates should be,” Paul tweeted. “The Fed manipulates prices, distorts the economy, and makes decisions by looking at the ‘data’ of a distorted economy.”

This is not the first time that Ron Paul — the father of current US Senator Rand Paul — has called to abolish the Federal Reserve.

As CCN reported in October 2018, Ron Paul trashed the Fed for manipulating interest rates, saying such artificial machinations could actually cause a recession. This, in turn, could bring about the death of fiat currency, he said.

“It is likely that the next Fed-created recession will come sooner rather than later,” Paul said. “This could be the major catastrophe that leads to the end of fiat currency.”

Paul said the only way to avoid a Fed-created recession is to let people use alternative currencies like bitcoin and to exempt cryptocurrencies from taxes.

Until very recently, Ron Paul was a staunch advocate of the gold standard who was critical of bitcoin, as CCN reported.

“Bitcoin is very exciting…but \[bitcoin investors\] don’t have a long-term perspective,” Paul said in December 2017. “What’s it going to be like in 10 years? Nobody knows. But we have a pretty good idea of where gold will be, in a general sense.”

Paul has since changed his outlook on crypto, and now says he believes that bitcoin and a gold-backed currency can co-exist in a free society.
