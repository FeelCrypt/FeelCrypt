"> I make logic-based statements

Logic isn't worth much if you start with a false premise.

> You didn't address commoditization.

Sellers of goods or services prefer to use a single currency over many. And this is what bitcoin will become: a global, day-to-day currency. It *kind of* is already, but it's not yet as good as it can be.

And while it's easy to clone the codebase, it's very hard to clone the network (and its effects).

Bootstrapping something like bitcoin is hard, that's why these forks even started to give away their forked coins for free (by cloning the bitcoin chainstate).

Listen, I have little interest in spoonfeeding you the stuff you should be perfectly able to figure out yourself if logic and critical thinking really is in your arsenal.

">> If it only ever remained as strictly something to exchange for goods and services, pizza would still cost 10k bitcoins. Due to its scarcity however, and excessive demand, the price is rising.

> That's called speculation.


No I just described what happens with supply and demand.  Nothing in what I said in the previous statement had anything to do with speculation.  It's like first week economics.  If supply is limited and demand is high, price goes up.  

Holy shit have you ever taken a course in economics?

> Gold actually did have a crash of 2013, and slowly lost value over the next two years.

Yes gold does go up and down.  Golf clap to pointing out the obvious.  So does the USD compared to other currencies.  Both are, for all intents and purposes, more stable that BTC. 

By stabilize I mean it doesn't fluctuate 10% a day for a weeks at a time.  

> There's zero reason to believe Bitcoin will his a ""true"" price and then flatline.

No.  That is not what I meant by stabilize.  Stabilize in the sense that it doesn't fluctuate by 50, 100, 500 percent over the course of weeks or months, every other month.  


> People are buying it to ride the wave, not because they care about the ""true"" value of cryptocurrency.

False.  If they are buying it as an investment, speculative as it is, Then they believe it is still due to rise in price.  Whether they are aware of it or not, they are buying because they still believe it is undervalued.  Even if they don't know how to word it correctly.

Then any competent trader will have a stop-loss set up, so those will start triggering, and the price will go down more and then the average trader will see the prices dropping and panic, and that's how crashes happen. 

Also, a lot of traders are using the same few EAs, so there are a huge amount of traders out there with ""automatically sell if the price falls to $X"" set up, all using the exact same value of X.

"I'm just getting in now.

Thing is, people have been wondering whether it's too late for *years*. I recently found a forum post a couple of days ago from March 2012 where people were looking back at 2009 and regretting that they didn't get into it a couple of years ago when they were only worth a few cents, if only they could have known how much it would explode, etc. Followed by comforting replies of ""don't worry man, don't beat yourself up over it, there's no way you could have known it would explode like it did"" etc.

Know what the price of bitcoin was in March 2012? About $5.

The truth is, no one can really know whether it's a good or bad idea to get in. But historically, it's only continued to rise - every time it's dipped, it just bounces back even stronger.

Some are speculating that we're still in the ""early adopter"" phase. I guess it just comes down to whether you believe in it long term.

"Hi there- 

""So not sure if I will be welcomed to the community as a noob posting on this thread but I gotta say what a hell of a jump! Congrats to you guys!""

thank you. it is really quite the milestone for bitcoin. And of course you are welcome here. We were all noobs at one point or another!

I can't tell you when a good time to buy is, but I will tell you about my bitcoin experience as a noob and hopefully you will be able to learn something from it.

I first heard about bitcoin in 2013 when it was around $100 and like most I ignored it, was skeptical, etc. After I heard it had spiked to $1300 in november 2013 I decided to set up my coinbase account and purchase 1 bitcoin. My first purchase took place on december 26 2013 for around $650 or so. Over the course of the next 2-3 months the bitcoin price began to rise up to $1000, and i ended up investing a significant amount of my savings into btc at around the $800-1000 price range. Throughout all of 2014 the bitcoin price continued to decline, slowly but surely..700,600,500,400,300,200... accompanied by literally hundreds of news articles stating that bitcoin is officially a failed experiment and will go to $0. I was pretty sad to say the least. But.. I continued to buy bitcoin every week during 2014, accumulating more slowly but surely, which helped to lower my average buy in price significantly. What kept me holding and not selling my coins during this depressing time was the fact that I had educated myself and understood the potential of this technology and knew that patience was required..Look at how many years the internet took to evolve into what it is today for example. It's important to understand what you are buying here! Do not buy btc simply for the sake of getting rich quick. take the time to do your research. It's worth it, trust me. 

If you really come to understand bitcoin you'll find that bitcoin is DESIGNED to continuously go up in the long term. If it does not appreciate over time then it WILL fail (im talking 5-10 years time, not annual insane growth like we have seen this year). Read up on the block halving to understand why if you are curious ..it comes down to simple supply and demand. 

Here is a youtube channel link to the best public speaker in the bitcoin community (imo). Andreas Antonopoulos helped me learn about bitcoin. bitcoin can be confusing but he is really great at helping noobs understand. He travels the world and educates people and various governments about bitcoin, and has been doing so for years now. My favorite is the video where he educates the canadian senate about bitcoin, though all his videos are good.

Ah, yes, I misunderstood you. I disagree. The amount of ones labor is directly correlated to ones likelihood of success. The more labor, the more likely the success. This seems so common sense im unsure how anyone could dispute it. You are cherry picking by taking a single example in which a largely funded company ended up failing, and trying to use that as a broad example.

">Holy shit have you ever taken a course in economics?

I have a bachelor's degree in economics, actually (though I got it ten years ago and work in an unrelated field, so I'm a bit rusty). And my point isn't that there's no demand for bitcoin, obviously there is. The demand is speculation. There's not a single goddamn person on earth buying Bitcoin at $9k because they think it's worth $9k. They're buying it because they think it'll be worth $10k in a few months and they can sell it for a profit. At some point, bitcoin will stop going up. All the speculators will cash out, driving the price down. People will see the price going down, get nervous, and sell, causing the price to go down, and creating a vicious cycle where people sell because people are selling. 

Bitcoin isn't going to, like, get to $12k and stabilize there. It *will* crash. That doesn't mean it's the next beanie babies or anything, it'll just crash to a lower price. Because when the price of a market asset increases by 1,000% in under a year with literally no on-the-ground change to justify it, there's *probably* a bubble. 

>Yes gold does go up and down. Golf clap to pointing out the obvious. So does the USD compared to other currencies. 

I was making a point though. No one uses gold as a currency because the value rockets up and down by an order of magnitude more than fiat currencies do. In 2013, gold saw 33% inflation. In 2017, bitcoin saw -1,000% inflation. And when it crashes, it'll have double-digit inflation. That's terrible for a currency you actually want to use as a currency. Bitcoin is an investment whose price is going up even as that very price movement is making it less effective at what it's supposed to do, because the people buying it aren't planning to use it as a currency; they're planning to flip it for profit. There's incredible deflation now. There'll be incredible inflation later. There'll be a crisis of trust after that because people won't believe btc can stay stable. 

There's a reason I can't walk into a store and buy some shoes with gold bullion, even if I could with Euro or Yen. Because gold moves around too much to be useful as a currency anymore. 

>If they are buying it as an investment, speculative as it is, Then they believe it is still due to rise in price. 

That's literally what I said, rephrased. 

>Whether they are aware of it or not, they are buying because they still believe it is undervalued

No, no no no. They're buying it because they think it'll go up in price in the short term, allowing them to sell at a profit. The ""true value"" of bitcoin is totally irrelevant. I imagine there's a lot of people buying bitcoin believing it's *over*valued, but that it will be even more overvalued next month and as long as they sell before the beer runs out they don't care if Bitcoin is at $1k again in six months. If I were confident bitcoin would rise for three more months and then crash, I'd buy now and sell in two months.

A short is essentially an insurance policy on a stock so instead of you making money when it gains value, you make money when you lose value. This is how a few people got extremely rich from the wallstreet crash of 2008. However shorts arent “if it ever falls” its more specific betting like “if it falls between this and this date” and you must pay an insurance fee in order to take out a policy on a stock. Bitcoin is so unpredictable that shorting it would be both very expensive with little return, and also very stupid as it could just as easily keep rising. You short something that you are VERY confident will crash at a certain time so if you know that kmart is doing some deal that you think will fail then you short that before the news of the failure comes in. For the 2008 crash they made so much money because they shorted very stable institutions so it was thought that those instiututions failing was very unlikely so the “insurance policy” was cheap compared to the potential earnings. So just as you only pay say $200 for a $35,000 policy they paid like $300million for a policy in the billions. For bitcoin though its more akin to paying $200 for a $300 policy. Rates of return are low as is predictability. ;1;0;False;avaslash;dqf5khj;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg

It’s a really valid point. Even in traditional investment circles it would not be advised to pay off the mortgage. Your return on investment is the interest rate which is 4%-5%. Instead OP could invest the cash in a mixture of index funds and bonds and earn more over the long haul. Home equity doesn’t really put your money to work, even though it’s emotionally nice to be free and clear of debt.;3;2;False;r3dt4rget;dqezxiw;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/
"There have been hundreds of opportunities to make hundreds of times your capital in the last 40 years. It's likely there will be hundreds more.

However, crypto is no longer an opportunity by those standards. We presently have a 300 million dollar market cap. Even by very optimistic estimates, such as crypto reaching twice the price of gold or more in a decade, you only stand to make 30-40 times your money. Obviously nothing to shirk at. but remeber the last couple of doublings of that wont be a huge opportunity. Thousands of stocks have doubled in a few years. It's not a huge opportunity once we're beyond 1 trillion, which looks soon. At that point, the growth potential is much less than many other speculative investments, yet the risk is still relatively high. 

The times of getting rich from crypto are over. Now are the times of maybe doubling your money a few times. no different than investing in goog, appl, msft, amzn, nvda, and so on...";1;2;False;aesu;dqfb5mr;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/
Exactly my thoughts....me too...devil's advocate here....Bitcoin has only just begun it's climb....What just happened in the past few weeks has solidified bitcoin's future...I always heard the opposite about paying off your mortgage...but not by average folk...cause that is what they all think...Successful investors do not cash out investments (especially one's that have not matured) to pay off their home...It doesn't make sense...21 btc????....and at less than 10k???....Why would you settle for 200k???....You bought at $130???....You realize you have now lost all oppportunity to make any substanial amount in the future?...Your house is paid off but you are poor now....What was the point of the investment?...Investment money is supposed to be for your retirement....And if you waited at least another year or 2...You would have had 10-20 times more...but imo...not enough to retire on...Paying your mortgage for 1-2 years more couldn't be as bad as missing out on cashing out $1 million....Which again imo is not even enough to retire with now....let alone in 10, 20, 30 years.....;-6;2;False;leilak50;dqezfp1;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

"> Bitcoin is pure gambling

Yes, we are betting that this technology will become big one day.  

It’s no different than purchasing MSFT or AAPL stock in anticipation of large adoption. I believe in the product, but I’m also keen enough to recognize a profitable trend, and there is nothing wrong with that.

> Bitcoin users have no fucking idea how finance works

That’s debatable. Lately the community has been over-run with “Get-Rich-Quickers” and Lambo-kids.  Most of us come from a Libertarian background based in Austrian economics.  Current prevailing wisdom from popular economists favour Keynesianism.  It’s not that we don’t understand finance (in fact, we are keenly aware of the difficulties of money transfer in general), it’s just that we disagree with current economic models.

> Bitcoin will never be a currency

I’ve already purchased a number of things with Bitcoin. Online and in-person.  Perhaps you lack the vision to differentiate what *may be* from *what is*.  Certainly, this economy is small, but it’s no different than scoffing at the nascent internet in 1994 because “I don’t know anyone who has an email”.

"I dont think you understand how stop loss orders work.

Logistically: 

are you suggesting you open a potion and them immediately stop loss at the price you entered? BTC price fluctuates ~$500 regularly. Youre going to get liquidated pretty much instantly. and then what - just do this over and over? losing a small amount of money but quickly over and over adds up fast.

Mechanically:

This is not actually how stop loss orders work, if the price tanks hard, you dont get the price you put the stop loss at, you get it at the best price the order engine can fill it as a market order.

So if the price is $10,000 and you put a stop loss at $9,900 but someone sells ~$50,000,000 or whatever huge amount of BTC because they're insane and dont care about slippage (it wouldnt be the first time - see the ETH flash crash), all the sudden the price spikes down to $7,000 instantly.

Actually in a way a paid off house does bind you. Let’s say it’s worth $300k. Now you just have $300k sitting in the home, unable to grow at a decent rate relative to other traditional investments. This is the case with the current low interest rates. If your mortgage is 4% and inflation averages 3%, you are much better off getting the mortgage and investing your cash instead.

"For sure, there's no lack of healthy momentum if you look at Bitcoin's price. It's has Tesla level acceleration, not out-of-control SpaceX-level like it did twice in 2013. Also, [from 2011-2013 it doubled six times](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#tgWzm1g10zm2g25zl) before that bubble crashed. From its most recent $200 low, it hasn't quite doubled six times again (that would take us to $12,800).

However most any other [asset price bubble in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble#Identifying_asset_bubbles) can be spotted somewhat by double-checking the valuation of the underlying assets. It's clear that 90% of Bitcoin's valuation is speculative potential (and ensuing mania) rather than the value of any currently implemented solutions.

For instance, during the dot-com bubble of 1995-2000, internet and e-commerce companies increased in value by 5x (doubled 2.25 times). Despite calls of a ""new economy,"" the underlying model for determining a company's value did *not* change. As a result, the NASDAQ fell 80%, back to its valuation before the bubble, and took 15 years to grow organically back to its highest valuation.

The whole information economy (judging by the NASDAQ's market cap) is now worth about $13 trillion. How much of that pie should Bitcoin be worth? (It's currently at $160 billion) 

The entire U.S. dollar M2 money supply is about $14 trillion. For those of us who follow Warren Buffett and agree that no one has made money betting against the U.S. economy, it may be a long time before any other world currency, digital or otherwise, supplants the dollar.

The current ""market cap"" of all mined gold is about $7 trillion. This does suggest another store of value could rise to eclipse it. But if you want a hard currency that can survive an apocalypse or government collapse, and attracts the type of investor who buys gold, a digital/electronically-based currency does not seem a likely candidate.

**None of this says that cryptocurrencies' $300 billion market cap can't double a few more times.

"""The moon"" is defined by the price that BTC needs to be in order to be financially capable of doing all the things that it is inherently technologically capable of.  Until you can send very large sums of money across the network without inducing large price movement and ultimately store that capital pre and post tx for a period of weeks / months without fear of gaining / losing more than 1% of the total sum then we have not reached ""the moon"".  If BTC is to become financially capable it won't be a possibility but rather a REQUIREMENT that liquidity match demand.  Tough to say exactly what number that occurs at as demand can be an ever rising quantity but I think it is safe to say it sits somewhere in the 250k - 1m$ / unit area.  A highly priced BTC may seem wacky but do the math and it becomes clear how it's actually a necessity not a possibility or probability.  Especially as inflation continues to chug forward globally.  A 17-18tn$ mkt cap equates to roughly 10% of global M1 supply.

"> In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts.

To withdraw 37.5K/year, you need enough money invested to not deplete it over a 20-30 year retirement. For a typical retiree hoping to live off stocks, it's generally assumed they can withdraw almost 4%/year, if they're in a safe mix of about 60% stocks and 40% bonds. So to get 37.5K/year with conventional investments, you would need about $1,000,000. (This ignores what 37.5K is actually worth in the future, after inflation.)

If you want to do this by re-entering the market at a lower price, to get at least part of your savings in Bitcoin, **you have to be right about a big list of assumptions:**

1. We are in a cryptocurrency bubble right now which will pop and fall 80%+ (not unlikley but not forgone), giving you a new buying opportunity.
2. You will NOT buy any more Bitcoin now or in the next X years as the price doubles Y times before it pops (psychologically very hard for humans).
3. You will know when it pops and finishes going down and will buy in close to the bottom (hard to impossible, given a century of data on stock market timing behavior).
4. You'll know what cryptocurrency to buy (whether it's Bitcoin or another crypto).
5. After it pops, it will not die and will again double many times.
6. If Bitcoin hits mainstream, at some level we don't know, it will no longer appreciate at a rate higher than inflation. For instance, gold goes up in value about as much as inflation (with huge volatility, similar to the stock market, making it a bad investment).

The end lesson is always the same, if you want to speculate on Bitcoin:

+ Dollar-cost average into it like you did

+ HODL it!

+ Only hold an amount you can afford to lose without panicking, like a stock market investment. (So good thing you sold, if you wanted it to pay off your house).

+ Diversify into some global stocks and bonds too, in case your crypto does go down 95%.";1;1;False;mobitymosely;dqf1c48;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/
Unless you had a really shitty interest rate, anything below 4% interest actually isn't a bad thing.  Mortgages are good for taxes.  Think about it...  A whole new form of currency is being brought into the world.  The USD has been the global currency for decades, and now something that simply works better (especially for high-worth individuals who got their money in shady ways) is coming to fruition.  Even if some other alt-coin takes over bitcoin, owing USD at a low interest rate is a better deal than paying it all off right now.  The USD could collapse soon.  Crypto represents an existential risk to a stable USD value.  Borrowing USD at low interest locked in for 30 years is the most sure short on the planet right now.  You'd have done better to convert half your btc into some safe stocks, selling them off a little each month to pay your mortgage minimums.  There is ZERO chance of USD being worth MORE in the future than it is right now.  And you just bought a few hundred thousand USD.;1;1;False;cowtung;dqf1h5c;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

Test your recovery process. If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.

"First of all, I have to commend someone for finally diversifying their assets. Bitcoin could easily have crashed another 85% any time! That type of risk is much higher than the stock market.

I haven't seen anyone mention this, though... for someone comfortable enough with risk to own that much Bitcoin, another option would be to cash out 80% and put half or so of that into a balanced stock/bond fund (e.g. Vanguard Wellington or Global Wellington) rather than fully paying off your house loan. 

Why? A home loan today, with points, is as low as 3.5%/year. Inflation is 2%/year. **So with a home as collateral, you basically are able to pay 1.5%/year to have access to 200K or however big your loan is.**

The U.S. stock market is by no means risk free (has negative return every 3 or 4 years on average, and can drop 50%+), but for long term money (5-10 years), a steady investor could do worse than buy a low-fee balanced fund like Wellington. It's been around since 1929, has 35% in bonds, and has returned 8%/year since then on average.";1;0;False;mobitymosely;dqexco1;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

Nah. You should have used a better liquidity provider. You should have gone OTC such as with Genesis because they will just wire you the money and their rate as well as equivalent fee is lower than Coinbases' 1%.

I dont think the long term capital gains rate is that bad. 30k to the government from a 200k gain? Do you have any capital losses you can offset that with? It should be pretty easy to get that to zero and thats already a really low tax rate.

"I'm heartbroken that you're on your way out (for good?), but anything that adds stress and affects your well-being is worth a purge.

I bought at $4000 and the ups and downs are very exciting - a few months' worth of disposable income.  The ups are really exciting, the potential for growth and boundless possibility is great to be a part of.

But the downs, the risk (*is it going to keep growing?  Are people going to stop buying*?), the uncertainty (*is the government going to seize your assets or something?*) combined with the day-to-day volatility - it's a lot. At least with stocks, the market closes, but Bitcoin is never 'off'.

The stress is never 'off'.  The fear of losing your nest egg is never gone - I wouldn't feel nearly as casual if I had the amount of BTC you do (did).

On the flip side, you don't need to keep 'earning' or 'investing' or 'riding' it.  For a $200k at 20 years and 5%, you're earning over **$1000/month for life** by not having to pay on your mortgage (taking a few definitions loosely and rounding to 'mental math' numbers).  

That's over $1000/month you have freed up now, and if you pay off your house, there's no risk associated with it.  We'd all be happy to tell you to leave $5k or $10k in, but hell, if you want out, get out and leave with a smile on your face.

"> It takes a long time to get out due to limits. I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.

So since were talking about capital gains, what is the best way to pay the least amount in taxes? Without it being considered evasion?;2;1;False;;dqetruh;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/
"Good on you!

When people ask me how much bitcoin they should buy (and when they should sell)... I just dont even know what to tell them.

So I tell them what I am trying to do.

My goal is to accumulate 1/10 of my mortgage in bitcoin.

I see it as a 50/50 casino bet (roulette wheel RED) w/ an asymmetric 10:1 payout.  I either get mortgage payoff money, or I lose it all.  Anything in between is market noise.  Maybe it takes a year, maybe it takes 15 years.

(As an aside... scaling it to the mortgage balance is telling in another way... if pissing away an amount equal to 1/10 of my mortgage would lead to financial ruin, then I am probably way too leveraged in my house relative to my income.  I have bought way more lifestyle than I can afford and am living way beyond my (low risk) means.  If housing has gone up considerably since I bought in (and I bought more than 3 years ago and can take up to $500k LTCG tax free), I should consider trading down into a less expensive house and using the increased equity from selling tax free to greatly reduce the mortgage on the less expensive house)

Anyhow, my goal is to accumulate that much, buying in blocks, and then to have enough cash (or reasonably liquid capital) reserved to buy massively more in the event of a crash.  Say mortgage is $100k (scale to your own situation).  Own $10k now, say 1btc). But have $10k available to buy a crash.  Maybe 1btc at $5000 and another 3.3btc at $1500.  Maybe even another 5btc at $1000 if you have the capital.  And if it ever sees those prices again.  Nobody really can predict.

But NOT your life savings, nor all your investment capital.

So OP, you have achieved the goal.  You own the house, no debt.  Life will look different going forward.  You can spend much less time doing what you have to do, and much more time doing what you choose to do.  Don't quit your job, but do make sure that the job you have is what you ""choose to do for money"".

this could be considered a monthly withdrawal.  basically 1% is $2400+, 2% is 4800+ (but increasing as btc goes up).  at 2% withdrawals, you would have taken out $135k cash, and left with $297k in crypto when it hits $23000.  1% would leave $379k in crypto.

With much more conservative assumption of just $2400 increase in price over 24 months (periods), and 2% withdrawals:

$101k withdrawn, and $178k crypto remaining.

One advantage of this approach is that taxes are lower.  Mortgage penalties too.  Large sum verification hassles gone.

If you are concerned for a pullback, sell 5%-10% now, and the rest slower.  I don't really think there will be much of one, even if there could be a long time around $10k resistance.

You are very correct about hardware wallet. I have bought several just in case and always test the recovery process before I send anything to them first time. I once did a firmware update and did not realize until after that all holdings would be fucked if my phrase was incorrect. It was correct thank god. Always store wallet and phrase as physically apart as possible should one of them be destroyed/stolen. Better keep them hidden inside a wall or something instead of a safe. Which one do you think thieves will take? Ledger nano s is also excellent because the phrase is never exposed on the computer. That is the most critical part considered all malware floating around.

"I agree, good decision given your situation. However I need to nitpick on one small detail:

> I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate.

This is a dumb advice as it convinces people etching on metal is the ""Right Way"", so they keep postponing the time-consuming action of actually doing the etching, and during all this time they never implement **simpler solutions such as redundant paper copies, which are superior**. This stupid advice is directly to blame for this guy's near loss: https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/

«*I was planning to etch the seed on a metal bar and hide it, but before that happened my housecleaning service threw the paper away*»

If he had been told instead to make multiple paper copies, he would have followed the advice right away since it was easy, and would have **never** gotten in the first place into the situation of having a single paper backup that was *meant* to be temporary...

Instead, make 3-4 paper copies of the seed, and simply store it obfuscated and/or hidden in 3-4 different locations: your house, a safe deposit box, your parent's house, your private office, etc. It's very easy to obfuscate the seed so that someone stumbling upon it would not realize what it represents:

* You could convert the words to numbers according to their position in the BIP39 list
* You could highlight seed words as they appear in order across multiple pages of a book
* You could write/print them in a very small font
* You could hide them in an object: a hollow chess piece, lighter, etc

If you are more computer literate you should instead use these tricks to obfuscate and hide not a Bitcoin seed but a PGP passphrase. Then the system becomes a bit more flexible as it solves the problem of how to store securely a bunch of other types of secrets (Bitcoin seed, digital files, master passwords, etc) and the encrypted copies of these secrets can safely remain in digital form, copied in multiple places. The PGP passphrase is the one and only thing that needs to be backed up in non-electronic form.";1;0;False;_mrb;dqewdya;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

In truth, there would be fewer BTC available since there are only 16M BTC in circulation right now (with many of them lost forever) and a good portion of the BTC would be hoarded by whales (pension funds, early adopters...).

A $100,000 BTC could be a plateau where the price starts stabilizing.";4;1;False;Exotemporal;dqfart9;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

If you had told the guys at the beginning that BTC would reach $10,000, they would have called you insane. I think it's unlikely that BTC will reach $1,000,000 but not absurd. Market cap doesn't mean that people put that amount in by the way. All it shows is how many coins there are and what people are willing to pay for them. In the future, people will buy fractions of BTC instead of whole BTC.

"It's backed by trust, just like all the previous versions of money were. The entire point of money is to trust an exchange where there is no trust between parties. The money is what guarantees you are receiving the value for your goods and services you agree to. The trust was in that the ledger being used was not falsified and was maintained by a trustworthy source, or that the medium of exchange was not easily duplicated/falsified. Ledger systems (which is what Bitcoin is) have been around as long as physical money has and were not based on anything tangible either.

Speculation on the value of money is something that has always gone on in one form or another since the creation of a limited resources. People would hoard gold, silver, precious stones, etc. In hopes that the rarity of the resource used in trading would go up in value. Bitcoin is no different.

It has value as a trustworthy medium of exchange and people are speculating on the limited nature of that limited resources. Bitcoin can't be faked (like gold but unlike paper currency) and it uses an efficient distribution system (unlike precious metals). Because of it's rarity and its utility, people are of course going to speculate that it will be used more in the future and therefore worth more. Sure, those who are special thing are only in it for profit, but it is completely secondary to the trust and utility of the system. 

Speculation is building interest in Bitcoin, but it will eventually be just like any other currency. As people become interested in the technology, they realize the criticism of it being not based on anything physical isn't really an issue as it's about the trust in the technology.

"> ""You could make a cryptocoin that there will only ever be 10 of"" The units aren't important. It just has to be a limited club that people want to join. But I think you're right that this is just another way of saying it's a speculative bubble.

Units are important when it comes to the economic forces that shape speculative bubbles.

Setting a ""bitcoin"" as the default unit of the currency has an important psychological effect. Because a bitcoin is such a high percentage of total bitcoins it allowed the ""value"" of bitcoin to surpass the value of a dollar very early on, which translates in peoples heads as ""bitcoins are more valuable than dollars"". It also hits other important psychological landmarks like ""bitcoin is worth more than an ounce of gold now"" or ""bitcoin is worth more than a car now"".

Except the entire market cap of bitcoin is a tiny fraction of the entire market cap of dollars, and its completely arbitrary to set 21 millionth as the default unit. A bitcoin is not equivalent to a dollar any more than a satoshi is.

If ""satoshi"" was the default unit, then you would not be seeing any of these posts about OMG SATOSHI JUST HIT $0.001!!! TO THE MOOON!!!

Bitcoin doesn't run automatically, it requires a group of people both to invest millions and continue to spend millions running mining gear, and it relies on those people to help decide changes to the currency in order to try to react to problems that come up.

They're backed by the power of the government to enforce taxes. So long as the government can both tax trade and demand taxes are paid in a currency then the currency will have value by definition because value is what is being taxed.

>But whether this demand for a currency comes from the private sector (merchants) or public sector (government taxes) is economically irrelevant.

"> That would describe almost all national currencies today

No, because those currencies are all continually measured against various external measures, including other currencies. If a currency is overvalued or undervalued, it's corrected quite quickly, and a bubble is not sustainable. 

Bubbles usually form in markets which are more isolated, where external measurement of value and correction is more difficult. The housing bubble is a good example. 

Bitcoin suffers from the potential for bubbles because it's currently not obviously connected to real measures - it's difficult to determine what it ""should be"" worth.

I'll leave the ""believing in"" to religious people. People ""believe in"" US President Trump. The reason they do that is they're disconnected from facts and understanding.

> So let's believe in sound, censorship resistant, counterparty risk not required, international money. Bitcoin.

Just saying it doesn't make it true. Bitcoin's current volatility undermines the idea that it's ""sound"", as does its lack of real-world backing of the kinds that national currencies naturally have due to having large populations and tax bases that are essentially required to use it. Bitcoin is basically in a similar position to Myspace - a first mover that's at risk of being replaced by a newcomer, especially one that addresses its various technical and usability shortcomings.

Counterparty risk is not a significant risk for major national currencies, so the benefit of Bitcoin there is somewhat abstract. 

Even censorship resistance is still a work in progress, since concentration of power among miners is a real risk.

""International"" is somewhat meaningless, or at least would need to be qualified - many other currencies are effectively international.

In short, your slogan needs work.

> They won't be able to fund their wars without inflation.

This is a pipe dream. You seem to be looking for ""something to believe in"" that will somehow fix the world's ills. I'm afraid a cryptocurrency is not going to be it.

A bubble is a phenomenon wherein the price of an asset grows significantly without any real apparent reason for the growth. Just because an asset will be ""way higher"" in price 5 years out doesn't mean something isn't a bubble, just that the bubble will last for 5+ years.

Bubbles are not, contrary to popular belief, only short term incidents that happen and die off quickly. Sure, the ""popping"" usually happens pretty quickly, but the inflation of the bubble can happen over a long time. The economic recession of 2007 was brought on by a years-long housing bubble because real estate prices were increasing without any real reason. Houses were indeed ""way higher"" in price 5 years later. Then they very quickly stopped being ""way higher"". 

With all that being said...

> By that logic, or society is a bubble. 

I don't know what logic you're using, but you're either from some different universe where logic follows different rules, or you don't know the meaning of the bubble. Can't really help you in the case of the former, but in the case of the latter, I typed out that explanation...

> It may be technically correct

It might be ""technically correct"", but only because the word ""bubble"" has a technical meaning in an economic context. It's a technical term. 

> but it really doesn't say much.

"> Most real estate has recovered significantly or resumed climbing in value since the 2008 crisis, which was only related tangentially to real estate. The problem was actually corruption and fraud in mortgage underwriting coupled with derivatives that created insane and unsustainable amounts of leverage. 

Well, you've got it a bit mixed up, I think. There *was* a housing bubble which collapsed. The reason that the housing bubble's collapse affected everything else was, as you said, corruption and fraud in mortgage underwriting, silly derivatives, and absurd leverage. Without those factors, there definitely would've been a reaction to the housing bubble bursting, but it likely wouldn't have caused a massive worldwide recession the likes of which hadn't been seen for nigh on a century. 

> Conversely, bitcoin is one of the most transparent and straightforward assets available, and there is probably also less underlying leverage in the crypto market than any asset class on the planet.

True enough, though I'd add the caveat that Bitcoin being ""transparent and straightforward"" is only true once you understand the basics of the system. Once that's known, yeah, it's a cakewalk. 

> Is bitcoin a bubble? Only time will tell.

"Borrowing alone doesn't cause a bubble. It's when the borrowing is disproportionate to the underlying value.

There are countries that didn't have housing bubbles that still had lots of people borrowing money to buy houses, which is a sensible thing to do when you can borrow at reasonable rates and have a steady income.

The problem in the housing bubble wasn't that people were borrowing money, but that banks were lending far too much money far too easily to people who weren't good for it. This simultaneously caused a boom in prices whilst causing a lot of underlying risk, so the value of housing became detached from the underlying value. Banks were lending $300,000 to people who couldn't really afford it, for a house that would only be worth $150,000 if they weren't pumping up the market with debt. One of the reasons they could do this was because of credit default swaps. They packaged up the risk of loaning money to these risky people and then sold it on, so they no longer were bearing the cost of the risk. This got into a crazy situation where banks and other financial institutions had bought up a huge amount of these CDSs without properly understanding how bad the underlying risk was. This was in part because of widespread fraud going on where institutions were just downright lying about how bad the risks were so they could make more money. CDSs were very poorly regulated so few people recognized the scale of the problem until it was too late.

Also the housing bubble didn't lose close to 50% of its value, so if you wouldn't count a 50% drop in bitcoin as a bubble I'm not sure what you would count.";1;1;False;suninabox;dqeqrv6;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

"OK, let me ask you in a different way, is cash flowing into a paypal account a bubble? Because you can withdraw it anytime, I'd say it's not an investment.

Is cash going into your checking account a bubble? Because you can withdraw it anytime, I'd say it's not an investment.

Now, Cash going into stocks can be a bubble, because the value of the company stocks can rise higher than the value of the products and services they create. Thats a bubble. 

Bitcoin is the opposite. The value it creates is higher and higher as the adoption rate increases. The value of bitcoin is as a virtually feeless banking and low fee international transaction platform that escapes exchanges and bank fees and holds and scrutiny, and restores some privacy to finance.

It's not a bubble because the value of bitcoin is extremely higher than the current price.

"Do some people buy bitcoin because they see other people do it and the increase of value? Yes they do, it is in our nature to speculate and in that sense you can twist many things to be a speculative bubble. 

To me the real value in Bitcoin is that it changes the architecture of money. We have seen time and time again that our current system is broken, most recently the 2008 financial crisis. It has been proven that we simply can't trust our money in the hands of intermediaries. It also seems that rather than correct the issues, we continue to temporarily patch them up with bailouts (our tax dollars). The banking system was great and has served its purpose, but times have changed and its time that we evolve with them. In my opinion, BTC seems the be the best option out there at this point in time. So the real question isn't how high can BTC go, but rather how low can our fiat system go? 

Also, keep in mind that where BTC is now is very early stages. When the internet first came out, people needed to spend thousands of dollars on a machine and it literally took days to send an email effectively. At which point in time the majority of people had trouble making sense of it and stuck to traditional mail. Lets be a bit more farsighted, lets try to erase our ideologies and fears and use our imaginations for the greater good. 

Regardless what happens, if we can build a system where the top 10% stop stealing the majorities hard earned money without consequence, I'll consider that a win. ";4;1;False;kalone65;dqew9qs;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

In a currency economy, that’s necessary to facilitate transactions. 

I personally think the ceiling on bitcoin won’t be reached until banks and governments get on board using it as a store of value, like the old gold standard, but I think that’s likely in economies that struggle with inflation, and in light of that I think the ceiling for bitcoin’s value is at least $100,000 in today’s money and then at least keeping pace with inflation relative to other currencies. So personally I’m planning to keep buying even when it gets above $10,000. But I could be wrong.

"Seriously though, current prices reflect all future growth expectations. Extrapolating asset prices based on trend lines is laughable. To be more specific, bitcoin is held by speculators, detaching the *current* price from being a function of the *current* saturation levels, the *current* price already reflects expected *future* saturation levels. The only way Bitcoin's (or any asset, I am not at all arguing against bitcoin specifically here) price will grow faster than the risk adjusted risk free rate (US bonds + a premium for bitcoin's level of risk) is in response to speculators revising their future adoption rate (adoption rate being the substitute for supply/demand in this case) expectations upwards. 

TL;DR OP only makes sense if the price of bitcoin only reflects current saturation rates, in reality the price of bitcoin will at any given moment in time reflect predictions for the eventual saturation rate as well as the speed at which it gets there at that same moment.

EDIT- Price right now is $9718 and I am hoping that it crosses $25k in 2018 around Jan-feb after which we go to a bearish slump for about a year (maybe seeing $5k in 2019 if we dont see $5k in 2017/18) and see $35k in 2020.;5;1;False;KarmaKingKong;dqehva9;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

"im not sure amazon has published figures of it's sales in bitcoin, but there are many outlets using and accepting bitcoin, it's just in the early stages. Right now, there is no killer app, that is being developed. 

The killer app is replacing currency. We already saw the push with apple pay, android pay, chips in credit cards for tap and go, NFC support, and blah blah blah. All of that is unneccessary and obsolete on bitcoin network. The specific why of it all is what is a mystery to me. 

For example, what is the main reason people would want to spend bitcoin versus their paypal? It doesn't make a difference. But flip it around, as a seller, which would you prefer? paypal and credit companies charge something like 3-5% for a transaction plus a minimum fee. as a merchant, selling on the bitcoin payment network entitles you to charge lower prices by the fees you save. and as a merchant, if you decide to longer accept paypal or square type fees, then you will push consumers to use the more modern, lower fee, bitcoins. So I think in t his way that ecommerce moving from traditional payment networks will be the first killer app, because they will be providing the goods and services that bitcoins will be spent on. 

It is a good point that adoption rate has exceeded the use-case scenario rate, however, this will not cause a collapse, only a correction between whatever peak adoption is versus peak-merchant-acceptance. 

Once peak merchant acceptance is reached, or at least a critical mass, adoption rate will also increase, providing a recursive growth effect toward max.

The scarcity is actually higher for these reasons, implying growth. But this is at a nearly 75% global adoption rate. Right now, the goal is to hit somewhere around 10% from the current .11%.

Bitcoin provides private transactions across international borders without taxes or fees from middlemen or exchanges. It allows transfer or funds without going through the ACH bank layer and being scrutinized and slowed. This may not matter to you, but to billions of people on earth, this is the first time in history that a financial instrument wasn't being used against them . 

Bitcoin offers a store of value, similar to removing your money from a bank and placing it into a gold deposit. It is sold on a market between miners and adopters like a stock exchange, but it is not a stock, There is no central entity that can determine the value, only the market determines the value. Gold requires safes and guards and security to manage and hold, which is all expensive. bitcoin can all fit on a sheet of paper or a thumb drive. 

the value of cash is constantly going down because it is constantly being printed out of thin air. cash is a bubble, constantly falling in value since the 1930s.

"Fiat currencies like the USD are **not** ""backed"" by any ""real world assets"" whatsoever. The very definition of ""fiat"" is that it's not convertible, not backed by anything.

As it has been demonstrated a countless number of times in history—examples: German Papiermark, Zimbabwean dollar—a fiat currency could still be ""backed"" by the power of a government and yet be run into the ground and become worthless... because it's not backed by anything.

u/WalksOnLegoredditor is economically correct: the only reason a fiat currency has value is because people think it has value, because they presume there will be **demand** for it (eg. a stable economy of merchants asking to be paid with it, or a stable government asking for taxes to be paid with it.)

But whether this **demand for a currency** comes from the private sector (merchants) or public sector (government taxes) is economically irrelevant.";14;3;False;_mrb;dqebe0p;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

"(Moderate) inflation is good for a currency because currency isn't doing any good if its not facilitating trade.

People who complain about inflationary currency not holding its value seem to forget that the point of money is meant to be to allow you to trade other things of value.

If you want something that's going to keep its value then you should use money to buy it. You're doing money wrong if it pays better to just keep money in a safe than it does to invest it in something that produces value. 

Because money is a token for wealth its very often confused for wealth itself. So money losing its value is seen as a loss of wealth.

Deflationists imagine a world where everyone just constantly gets richer because money is getting scarcer. But changing the amount of money in the world doesn't change the amount of wealth. and you paradoxically decrease the amount of wealth in the world when you encourage people to just keep hold of money rather than using money to facilitate trades that generate wealth.";1;1;False;suninabox;dqepsb6;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

Legal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.

"The US dollar doesn't have any real world assets backing it up either... gold backing the dollar ended in 1971. The governments purpose in currency now is to state the worth on a collection of hard-to-recreate objects and manipulate it in certain ways to have everybody on the same page to make trading goods and services easier from citizen to citizen and now over the internet.  

But there's flaws... the governments and banks have human workers that need to get payed, and they have (occasionally) greedy human CEO's wanting to get payed way more for (occasionally) bad incentives. There's hundreds of millions of dollars getting payed to these people daily.

Now what if we dissolved all of that, automated everything, and redistributed the ""would be"" wage of bankers among the citizens in meaningful incentivized ways, ways that would make them stimulate the economy in a healthy fashion?

Instead of (occasionally) greedy humans manipulating the economy and making decisions we don't really have control over, there's a truly democratic way of automating it all while rewarding citizens for stimulating it through buying and selling among other things. What if we apply a similar idea to other businesses where automation replaces a majority of it's employment?

"I've thought about this one quite a lot, and I really don't think ""I can pay taxes with it"" gives fiat an intrinsic value.

If we stopped using fiat for literally everything other than paying taxes, how big a desire would you have to accumulate large amounts of fiat?

Not very much, I assume? So the value of fiat drops sharply due to lack of demand. I can see the logic of ""But people will always want *some* to pay their taxes, so there's a minimum value"" - and it does carry some merit. But so does the argument that governments would realize they're losing out by insisting on receiving taxes in an unused currency, and would instead start demanding we pay our taxes with Bitcoin.

And add in the fact that the government has to actually spend that fiat on services, wages etc. If the fiat value drops sharply, because nobody wants it, the government is going to struggle to recruit people and buy services. In order to do so, they'd have to print more, devaluing it further... or just start taxing and paying people in fiat.

While I do agree that government taxes and spending are a major part of our uses of currency, I don't think they're an impenetrable barrier to fiat ever being destroyed. Look at the times major currencies have been replaced (Deutschmark->Reichmark), for example: being able to pay taxes in the old currency didn't stop the value plummeting when outside market forces dictated it.

Now to be clear, I'm not a crypto-anarchist who thinks fiat will be dead in 3 years: just that I disagree taxes/government wages give fiat an intrinsic value.

"apple is a stock, it's limited in value by the amount of products and services it can produce. it can't reach the full money market cap because apple stock isn't money, it's a commodity you buy with money. 

bitcoin is money. bitcoin can absorb all of the money, the way cash and credit cards and bank balances and paypal balances all absorb money.

with bitcoin, we are talking about simply converting cash to bitcoin. right now you can convert cash to paypal balance or cash to debit card balance etcetera. nobody accepts apple stock as payment. the price rise comes from the scarcity of bitcoin. Stock has no scarcity, you print how ever much you wanted and then do splits if you wanted more. with cash, it's the same way, print out as much as you want. 

with bitcoin, there is a fixed supply. if the supply weren't fixed, like a gift card isn't fixed supply, then the price of a bitcoin would simply be 1$ in and $1 out. 

but since there are holders, and some coins were lost, and not all coins were mined yet, and because of the vast gap between money adoption versus bitcoin adoption, there is scarcity of bitcoins to go around versus the dollar. 

so the price rises

none of this happens with apple stock, because for apple stock to rise it has to sell more than it did last year. for it to fall it simply needs people to sell it's stock over the buy bid market, leading to undercutting and falling prices, oir for the same amount or less of people to buy it's products each fiscal year.

"The honest answer is ""I don't know"". I think you are overlooking the reasons why people invest into gold. Gold is not just a commodity, it's an industrial resource, being used in almost every single high-tech manufacturing chain. When I invest into gold, I invest into that intrinsic value and industrial demand for it, knowing that it will only increase. No amount of bitcoin will ever make up for that need for gold. The only market overlap bitcoin **may** have with gold is the people that invest into gold ""just because"" or any fad followers/jumpers. If it's these 5% that leave gold market and jump into Bitcoin, that will only mean more stability for gold market in the long run, but I personally don't think that these 5% will be a healthy market for Bitcoin.

I'm not a mathematician or a programmer, so I don't know enough to say whether any proposed solutions will or won't work, but I do know enough to know that any certainty in a solution before you actually have the solution is misplaced, and that there are lots of reasons why people with huge financial interest in bitcoin would like to believe at all costs that bitcoin will work no matter what and that there's no flaw in the underlying tech/concept that will stop it from mainstream adoption.

Edit: Re your edit: 

> Bitcoin was designed to be the BEST at being money. 

Uh, I fail to see how that is. The only qualifier for money is the ability to exchange it for goods and services, and bitcoin fails at that. If I went to my local grocery store, I can't pay with bitcoin. Movies? Nope. Get gas for my car? Nope. Internet outage? Can't pay for a pizza. You need a hardware wallet to prevent theft, which then ties you down to a computer. It's a bulky unwieldy thing that relies on a huge complex infrastructure of both electricity and internet. So please try again to prove your point.

> You're missing a major factor of the use of gold. Yes, I absolutely agree that gold is very useful for industrial purposes. But so are many other metals. Gold is unique in that, for thousands of years, it has ALSO been the best at being a money. A significant portion of demand for gold is demand for it as a money. It is time tested and proven for thousands of years that it serves the purpose of being money very well. Now. We have this new thing called Bitcoin, which aspires the be the BEST at being money. We can argue over whether or not it has achieved that goal, but don't be confused by the fact that gold also has uses other than money. That's irrelevant.

The average consumer couldn't give two shits about the ""limited supply"" aspect of their money. They only care about how valuable it is and what they can get with it.

Likewise the average consumer doesnt worry about their money being confiscated, nor does the average consumer have issues with trans national transactions.

State backed currency is inherently more useful than any other thing you could trade. As long as there is state backed currency, BTC wont stand a chance because it provides far less utility for 99.999% of the population

Additionally, we will most likely see states and financial institutions strip the most useful parts of the technology and start to use them.

"1. Bitcoin is unhackabke on a Hardwallet, in which case, it pretty much becomes a password protected version of physical gold. And it is completely unconfiscatable if you choose to memorize your key in your head. The only version of Bitcoin that remains subject to loss due to hacking is the kind you keep on an exchange or a software wallet making it no less vulnerable than the dollars in a bank account.

2. Bitcoin's intristic value is it's unique properties that no other currency or medium of exchange has. I've already listed them. You might say that ""block chain"" has those properties, but that ignores the fact that Bitcoin is JUST a block chain. That's literally what it is and all it is.
Gold has intrinsic value, but the values you listed are not relevant to the economic value of gold. Gold is valuable because it satisfies the properties of a good money. It also has fixed supply and is scarce. This has made it a good money to use as a global reserve standard for thousands of years. Not all metals are considered valuable as money, yet all also have intrinsic value. Some even have more when it comes to industrial use.

3. Coinbase accounts and other crypto exchange accounts have been increasing by the hundreds of thousands months to month.

As for your final comments, you're still missing the primary purpose of Bitcoin. Would it be bad for our tech of gold disappeared? Sure. Would it be bad for our tech if platinum disappeared? Yes, definitely. But what does that have to do with our monetary system? The monetary system governs our abstract evaluation of wealth. See, money and currency are not physical properties of the world. They are abstract, metaphysical constructs useful to humans when trying to exchange value and wealth. Literally ANYTHING can be money. Coconuts. Sea shells. Toys. All have been used as money at some time in history. All that was required was that people AGREE that it be money. And again, there are better and worse monies. Gold, for the longest time, served the purpose of money THE BEST. Bitcoin was designed, not be used in jewelry, not to be used for industrial purposes, not to be used for ANYTHING but for one purpose. Bitcoin was designed to be the BEST at being money.

That's a fair point that I hadn't thought of. Although the concept of legal tender means that in practice, the government could probably force people to accept fiat. Actually, come to think of it, legal tender is another big intrinsic source of fiat currency's value.

But I think generally, the government has a very strong incentive to maintain fiat as a standard means of exchange, because they can control its value much more easily than they can control the value of crypto. They can also print more of it (in moderation, obviously, lest they become like Weimar Germany), to make up funding shortfalls. This isn't conspiracy thinking: I *want* the government to play some role in managing the value of money, to help smooth over the impacts of financial crises, and I like that money printing exists as a fiscal policy option, so long as it isn't overused. Even if you don't agree with me on those points, you can look at it more cynically: governments don't like giving up power over things, and they will use all the means at their disposal to avoid doing so.

Wait, you think there's *no reason* for bitcoin's growth?? Do you own any? Have you ever used it? 

>Just because an asset will be ""way higher"" in price 5 years out doesn't mean something isn't a bubble, just that the bubble will last for 5+ years.

No. In 5+ years, it will still not be in a bubble, because 10 years after that, the price will be *even higher*. By your logic, gold is a 10,000-year-old bubble just waiting to pop, any day now. 

>Bubbles are not, contrary to popular belief, only short term incidents that happen and die off quickly. Sure, the ""popping"" usually happens pretty quickly, but the inflation of the bubble can happen over a long time. The economic recession of 2007 was brought on by a years-long housing bubble because real estate prices were increasing without any real reason. 

What's your definition of ""real reason""? 

>Houses were indeed ""way higher"" in price 5 years later. Then they very quickly stopped being ""way higher"". 

Yes, because people rapidly exited the housing market, popping the bubble. 

I completely agree that the 2007 housing market crash indicates that the previous few years had been a bubble, *if you zoom in*, and *especially* if you were one of the people who got burned because you thought it would keep going up forever, but you panic sold once the price started tanking.  On the other hand, if you were calmly buying at the bottom, I'd say it wasn't a bubble for you, because you were looking at the big picture. 

In reality, nobody can say whether an asset is in a bubble until it pops. And even then, depending on the long-term viability of the asset, by some definitions it was not a bubble. That is, if the asset eventually keeps reaching new all-time highs, then it wasn't a bubble. You could say that bitcoin is in a mini-bubble every time the price hits a new ATH and then bottoms out. The only difference between these mini-bubbles and the larger ones that take a year or two is time scale.

If you are aware of previous peaks in bitcoin and refer to them as “bubbles” then we are operating on different definitions of the term.

">Deflation doesn't happen because money gets scarcer

Monetary deflation happens due to relative scarcity of the money supply. It doesn't matter if the amount of money goes down and the amount of wealth goes up, or the amount of money stays the same and the amount of wealth goes up.

Overproduction by itself does not cause deflation so long as you're printing enough money to match all the increased produce. You can always cause inflation by printing enough money.

Amount of wealth / Amount of money = the rough value of each unit of money.

Course there are a lot of edge cases but in the general case money obeys the same rules of supply and demand as everything else. If for a given demand you reduce the supply then the price goes up (deflation), if the demand stays the same and the supply goes up then the price goes down (inflation).

Imagine what it would take for a widely adopted fiat currency like the € or $ to lose its value. The insolvency of a large government? Embargos from the rest of the world? Unlikely.

Now imagine what it would take for a cryptocurrency, as large as $ or € but spread among all nations, to lose its value. The destruction of the internet? The end of the exchange of information? Impossible.

"The adoption rate IS growing to hundreds of millions, 

Not my opinion, any chart will show the same data. 

Spouting bullshit?

This is happening in real time and people want an explanation. Can you provide an explanation for the growth other than the adoption rate?

Claiming it can go up or down is just stating the obvious. I understand the desire and altruism of playing devils advocate, but can you explain why the adoption rate would halt then reverse versus accelerate up? 

Look at dogecoin charts. That is a dead coin. there is no exponential growth charted there. look at bitcoin all time. it looks just like an exponentiual curve.

"This isn't about the moon, this is about the rational realization that all of the growth is being driven by the adoption rate as a primary force. Things like good news, forks, holiday pumps, whatever, are all minor corrections to the overall growth chart. 

I feel like no one but me has ever seen Ray Kurzweil point to his graphs. You don't understand exponential growth. You don't have a feel for it, you think gossip at thanksgiving drives 10billion dollars to the market cap in 48 hours. It's not that. It's the simple adoption rate. 

TV and radio took like 50 years to reach 50% market saturation. 

Paypal took 5 years.

Bitcoin has taken 7 years so far to reach a .11% adoption rate. You just felt it grow from .09% to .10% when you saw the price rise from 6k to 8k. Then when it hit .11% adoption rate this week, you saw the price hit 9700. Next week the adoption rate will be .15%, and the price will be 10-14k. Next month the adoption rate will be .3%, and the price will be closer to 14-20k. By the end of the year, the adoption rate will exponentially grow to 1-2%, and the price will be 90-400k.

No amount of gossip is making this happen. The future is just arriving and you are going through future shock. This is the second step toward a type 1 kardashev civilization we are taking here.

"My prediction for next month is 10-14k.

it was in the news recently that less than .1% of people have adopted bitcoin. That news comes from this source document:

https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=F2425415-DCA7-80B8-EAD989AF9341D47E

It claims that of the 250trillion dollars in liquidity globally, that the current crypto market is, at only 250billion total, only .1% or 1/1000th of the total possible cap. 

What this means is this: of the 250trillion investment dollars out there in the total aggregate global earth market, only 1 in a 1000 is using bitcoins in their portfolio. 

So, of the investors only, and not the wider general population, bitcoin is an asset with only .1% capitalization. Actually less, as bitcoin was only 150billion of the total crypto 250billion market cap, that is, until 2 days ago, when coinbase recorded 100000 new users in a day and the market rose 10billion dollars and the price moved from 8k to 9.7k. So, actually, the adoption rate of crypto is about .11%, and so bitcoin is only .07% of the global market, now that some growth has happened in the last few days on top of my numbers. Towards my numbers. 

From this knowledge, it's just supply and demand relationships driving the price from x-y. using aggregate and averaged data, the price will rise to 14k-90k over 2018.";1;1;False;fuck_reddit_suxx;dqeymt2;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

"> Why $100,000? Why not 50,000 or 200,000?

My own conjecture as to the likely size of the ultimate Bitcoin economy. I don’t think the Bitcoin economy is likely to get as big as any of the major national economies, but I do think it’s likely to hit around one or two trillion dollars. I suppose $50,000 is just as likely as $100,000 at the time that the adoption level peaks, but I think it will continue to grow relative to the dollar after that time. 

But mostly just a guess, perhaps an optimistic one.

The current monetary structure that the ENTIRE world operates under has only existed since 1971. That's a VERY short period of time. And, by the way, this monetary system is completely experimental. It has never existed before in history, where nearly all international exchange is conducted in fiat and all currency are purely fiat, backed by nothing. There is absolutely no guaranteed that inflation will not spiral out of control. The Fed has publicity stated that they aren't completely sure how inflation works... Do you genuinely think they'll be able to manage a fiat currency that backs the near entirety of international trade without fail for the remainder of human existence? That's much less stable and predictable than you paint it out to be. A gold standard would be infinitely more predictable than this system, but I'm not advocating that.

That was kinda his main point... you're basically saying that the USD is valued as it is... because it already *is*. And that's also your justification for why it should be valued as such. Don't get me wrong -- it's a strong justification in its own right, because spending *is* based on futures, in general. 

But nothing in your comment disagrees with the fact that bitcoin could eventually have that same sort of value in the ""real world."" The other guy was making a joke about the gold standard, but the joke holds true -- weren't people worried about erasing the gold standard at the time? 

>But take an economics 101 class and learn about why a managed currency is so vital to our economy

I took a few econ classes in college (though, unfortunately, they were all 101/201/301 classes), but my take-away from it is that a ""managed currency"" is vital to our economy simply because it already has been in the past, and we're used to it -- more importantly, the *government* is used to it. 

>bitcoin can and will never replace that

Don't you think the gold supporters were thinking the same thing before paper currency was developed? 

I guess my main issue with your argument is that I'm now starting to think bitcoin will hit 15-20k by the end of the year, regardless of any news or anything else. It's gonna make that mark simply because of the amount of people using it -- and also partly because various Asian nations are starting to accept it as a form of currency. At this point, I honestly think even if there's some *bad* news, it'll just cause the price to bounce back even higher after the dust settles. 

Just keep in mind (as reference) -- I currently have no money in bitcoin, so none of this is personally relevant to me right now (and even back in the day, I only made like a 100 bucks from it). But I'll still stand by my statement that it's gonna hit above 15k by December 31st -- though now it looks more like it'll hit 20k, just because (IMO) everyone's about to put more money in, just cuz they wanna see how high it can go.

In the short-term, I think there's a bit of a bubble, but even if the supposed bubble pops, bitcoin's only gonna drop down to like 6k, if that. It simply has too many backers at this point to drop down any lower than that. 

Again though, I'm saying that as someone who never made any money from bitcoin, and I'm sincerely hoping it drops to like 2k or something. But realistically -- no, it's too late at this point. Once a stock like Apple or Microsoft picked up steam as a stock, did the stock ever drop to like 5% of what it had previously hit? I'm not gonna google it to find out, but I'd assume the answer is no (I'm not talking about the *very* beginnings of the stocks, where I'm sure they constantly fluctuated -- I'm talking about after they were somewhat established). Did they ever drop that far? No -- I just googled Apple's stock history. It dropped to 25% of what it was, temporarily, and then shot up like a rocket afterward.

"> Wait, you think there's no reason for bitcoin's growth?? Do you own any? Have you ever used it?

There's plenty of good reason for Bitcoin's growth. There's absolutely no good reason for Bitcoin to jump 70% in the last month. That is what one calls a ""bubble"". 

> No. In 5+ years, it will still not be in a bubble, because 10 years after that, the price will be even higher. By your logic, gold is a 10,000-year-old bubble just waiting to pop, any day now.

Steady growth does not a bubble constitute. Steady growth is what Bitcoin had from early 2014 until relatively recently. Unexplainable, random, drastic increases in nominal value, on the other hand, is usually a sign of a bubble. 

> What's your definition of ""real reason""?

In the specific case of the housing bubble, a corresponding spike of population in the demographic looking to buy homes/property, or the passage of legislation that made owning land more lucrative, or  something to that effect.

> Yes, because people rapidly exited the housing market, popping the bubble.

And what makes you think the same won't happen with Bitcoin? Especially when, as it becomes more mainstream, investors and the like are buying in and potentially (oh who am I kidding; almost definitely) looking to manipulate it using the same techniques that they might try to use on the actual stock or forex markets but for the fact that those are far more regulated and much larger? Deliberately creating a bubble and being the first out when it pops is highly profitable, after all, and much easier to do and harder to detect with bitcoin due to its nature. 

> I completely agree that the 2007 housing market crash indicates that the previous few years had been a bubble, if you zoom in, and especially if you were one of the people who got burned because you thought it would keep going up forever, but you panic sold once the price started tanking. On the other hand, if you were calmly buying at the bottom, I'd say it wasn't a bubble for you, because you were looking at the big picture.

I'm not entirely sure what you're saying here... it seems to me that you're saying whether or not the 2007 recession was precipitated by a housing bubble depends on whether or not you bought in? Is that what you're saying? Because that incident was a bubble regardless of when you bought in or whether you did or not. The only question is when, if ever, you were engulfed by the bubble. Sure, if you bought in before the prices started to climb without rhyme or reason, then you weren't really engulfed by the bubble, the bubble just formed around you. That doesn't meant the bubble doesn't exist, though.

> In reality, nobody can say whether an asset is in a bubble until it pops. And even then, depending on the long-term viability of the asset, by some definitions it was not a bubble. That is, if the asset eventually keeps reaching new all-time highs, then it wasn't a bubble. You could say that bitcoin is in a mini-bubble every time the price hits a new ATH and then bottoms out. The only difference between these mini-bubbles and the larger ones that take a year or two is time scale.

I'm not using the term ""bubble"" in an everyday sense. Bubble has an actual definition in economics, which is what I'm using.

And there were plenty of economists who were warning about the housing bubble years before it burst. I'm sure they aren't particularly happy about the manner in which they were proven correct, but they called it. Sure, it's not always so clear cut in the moment whether an asset is in a bubble or not, but the housing crisis is a bad example to pick for that because there were those that called it. And Bitcoin is an even worse example - it's been in a similar bubble before, and the current spike in price has a lot of similarities with that time.

Incidentally, by your definition of a ""bubble"", the 2013 BTC bubble was ""not a bubble"", since we eventually reached new ATHs, when that bubble is about the most clear-cut example of one that I can think of... outside of this current one, that is.

"> I’m not an expert in this field, but I don’t believe I have it mixed up. The housing crisis didn’t cause the debt crisis, it was the other way around. If the agreed upon factors of fraud and excessive leverage didn’t exist, the funny money wouldn’t have been created with which to drive the housing market into a bubble. They are interrelated issues, but the housing bubble was a direct result of the underlying issues in debt creation more so than vice versa.

No, you're absolutely right about the order/correlation. I just misinterpreted your first comment as saying that there was no housing bubble at all. My bad!

> If you are aware of previous peaks in bitcoin and refer to them as “bubbles” then we are operating on different definitions of the term.

I'm referring to the specific bubble that occurred in late 2013/early 2014, where BTC price went from ~$200 to $1100 in 1 month, then dropped down to ~$400 or $500 dollars, where it remained for quite a while afterward.

> I consider a bubble to be an unsustainable price increase of an asset, driven primarily by the notion that someone will pay more for it in the future rather than based on the fundamentals of the asset, after which it loses a significant percentage of value and either never recovers, or perhaps takes a significant amount of time to recover. What I’ve seen in crypto is not bubbles, but a new and volatile market with fundamentals that are still being identified and are based on a huge number of variables, making price discovery difficult and ever evolving.

I agree with your definition, but what qualifies as a ""significant amount of time"" for recovery? Because the price of bitcoin practically didn't change at all (i.e. fluctuated in the same range) for something like 2.5 or 3 years despite its growing acceptance as a currency and increased adoption in that time period. Moreover, the current drive of BTC in this recent spike seems to be very much predicated on the notion that someone will pay more for it in the future - you can see it in the replies to this very meme post (though admittedly this subreddit is a bit of a self-selecting community). 

I agree that the fundamentals of bitcoin are still being identified, but I don't think that the recent spike is justified by any set of fundamentals at all, and is largely driven by hype and a desire to ""get in at the bottom"" of the spike. I mean, as I was saying in another discussion, the price of BTC has risen 70% within the last month.

"Or maybe it will one day turn out that I understood bitcoin better than you do ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

The whole point is that nobody knows until it happens, and the most fundamental tenant of any form of investing is that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Many people are investing in bitcoin simply because they expect the price to rise in the future so that they can profit, and that's the wrong reason to invest in bitcoin. That's what creates a speculative bubble, and if this speculation pushes the price above the true market value, then anyone who doesn't get out before the crash happens is ultimately going to lose a lot of money.

People are investing because they want in on a commodity whose value has seen exponential growth. That’s it. When that rapid growth stops, which is 100% certainty, two things can happen.

"On the one hand, I like the idea of all these newly rich people. On the other, I feel bad for all the people who are going to inevitably jump off buildings because they lost their wealth by not selling at the peak. 

The value of bitcoin is in the momentum of bitcoin. It’s rapid rise is making people, myself included, jump on board for fear of losing out.  But this type of exponential growth seems unsustainable. Especially when a few people holding lots of bitcoin could decide to cash out, and set off a spiral. 

The creator, and likely large bitcoin holder, is anonymous. Could be anyone. So there is no way to predict if he wants or needs to cash out. He could be 98 years old, and on his death bed, and his children cash out because they aren’t true believers. Flooding the market with bitcoin would drop its value, and a sudden drop might see nervous people do likewise. Which, would be the crash that lots of folks are predicting. Leading to the inevitable gnashing of teeth and increased suicide rate i was referring to earlier. 

Then again, it could stabilize at 100,000 and in 30 years people will look back at a revolutionized world.  It is impossible to predict, which is what makes it so damn risky. Nevertheless, you’d be a fool not to invest.... but you’d be a fool to invest more than you can stand to lose. I’ve been watching this for a while thinking “these people are nuts” as I see them make multiple times their investment in a short order. And it keeps happening over and over.  I have no doubt that there is an end to this train, but it could be 5 years of exponential growth before the train derails. 

So I got my ticket to ride, and plan on putting any spare money I have as time goes on. Anything I can bear to lose, is going on the train.  I just can’t sit and stare as the train passes by screaming at the passengers that they are doomed. No, I’m getting on at the station and hoping I can jump off at the top of the hill.

Don't be too hard on yourself, just think about it this way. There is no difference between having held 10 BTC at a price of $100 back then, or simply having had $1000 back then. Both scenarios had the potential to give you massive profit if you kept the BTC... or spent the thousand dollars on it. And how many people had $1000 to spare when BTC was $100 each?

"At least you got something out of it. 

I lost a all my bitcoins when my online wallet was stolen in 2013. I won't shed a tear thinking about how my btc could be worth millions today though because realistically I would have sold them back in spring 2013 for ~$250 a coin. But the thing is: Back then I could have used the money! I was just in the progress of starting my own business and there was a time in spring 2013 where I lived in my car for some weeks and starved because I couldn't afford a hotel, driving home or eating something. For three weeks I told my client that I'd go to the hotel or home the weekend, then drive to the next Autobahn rest area and sleep in my car. I bought me a coke there once a day so I could use the restrooms, shower and shave. It wasn't that bad and I saved roughly € 500 a week that way but it certainly was my personal rock bottom and I felt like an impostor in those days. 
However, I still remember reading that btc reached $ 260 on my iphone while taking a shit there. Maybe it was because I was hungry and felt really uncomfortable but having ""lost"" my wallet never felt as bad as it felt that day... 

Every btc milestone after that just felt like a pleasant surprise for me. I still remember reading how btc exceeded $ 1000 in November that year (not entirely sure about that date) and that I just thought: Good for the guys that still have their's. By then I was through the worst of it and knew everything would be alright in financial terms. I was moving in my first own(ed) apartment and had just ordered my first luxury car.

because the adoption rate is only .11%, growing by ten percent into .12%. only a few million people use this. it's not a stock so it can't bubble. it's a currency, like paypal, except instead of being tied to fiat minus fees and with loss of control, you get international exhchange, universal prices. the reason it's going up is instead of being printed infinitely like money, it was mined from a limited supply. so even though the adoption rate of money is high, they keep printing it so it keeps deflating in value and inflating prices, where as bitcoin is the opposite. there is a fixed amount, even though more and more people are using it and over the long term are also being born. this means the price can only ever go up. rather, i should say the value can only ever go up, in comparison to shitty dollars or other fiat. it's likely to be earth's first global currency. like coka cola is earths drink and Disney is earths childhood, the mona lisa was smiling at Satoshi. ;0;8;False;fuck_reddit_suxx;dqe2gcr;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

"Crypto currency is a value virus. It tugs on all of the key aspects of human emotion, even addiction.

The only reason I see a bubble is when the coin is more valued than its actual functionality. The Bitcoin derivatives are first pass vanilla proof of concept coins. Pay close attention to the 2nd and third generation coins. The go to will be when the coin has some sort of feature or gimmick. Steem being a social network platform. ETH / EOS are back ends for greater functionality.

Most people are buying bitcoin with the expectation of making a profit from their purchase, not to use them as a medium of exchange as currencies are traditionally used.

"Bitcoins price could also be viewed as a function of our willingness to pay. With decentralization, the law of supply and demand have heavy influence on the price (couple with FUD of course). But If I were to sell a bitcoin for 20k in a couple months and the market accepted that as the value for a bitcoin, then so be it. 

A lot of this bubble talk is from my friends, and others that have no idea what bitcoin/blockchain tech is. They just read headlines from bankers and accept that as true. Eventually there will be a clawback and all of these projects that don’t have any working code will disappear. However, until then let’s all just continue to argue with people we know about how bitcoin and other projects aren’t “scams” etc. ;) ";1;0;False;Bauer96;dqep77d;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

A bubble is characterized by hordes of people greatly overestimating the value of something for whatever reason. For Apple stocks for example because of the emotional attachment stock holders have for Apple. It is way above the monetary value represented by the company.

"This debate never dies. Currency exists because it is easier to trade shoes for gold and gold for bandages than it is to offer shoes to the already well-shoed bandage maker.

It is an intermediary, its value is tied to the amount of it that exists (you can't get infinite gold), or tied to the value of the individual items it can be exchanged for (gross product).

It isn't about to just disintegrate, for as long as people respect that currency as the norm. If anything, national dissolution is the most threatening thing to a currency, as it gets replaced with whatever power comes to be in that country.

And then you have weird shit that arises like legal tender:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender

As long as the country's legal system recognizes it as a form of payment for damages then it will be unlikely to change. Why spend so much energy uprooting the existing currency when the one replacing it isn't that much better? Well.

Because it decentralizes power. The country holds power nationally over the exchange of goods, legal tender and the mint of the country or the main bank that prints money, in times of war, you can sometimes just print cash out of fucking nowhere which would otherwise be illegal.

An internationally recognized currency kind of prevents centralization of power, and specifically market regulation.

An interesting effect of inflation is that the party who has nothing has the most to gain in an inflating economy. A rich man suffers most. If the government started printing more money, and inflation occurred, then the riches that the person already acquired are worth less (if they're kept in legal tender).

This means they'll want to buy shit. Real goods don't depreciate as rapidly in value if you buy and store materials which do no perish, gold reserves are usually steady in times of uncertainty, but real estate is also good. Buying land is always going to be good, even if the market inflates, who cares? Your land is still going to reach a point where the effective value is the same or more as land reserves decrease.

Say I bought a small patch of grass for 2 Dollars now, the market inflates, if I had kept my 2 Dollars, I would be worse off, because the inflated price of the patch is now $2.20

Say the market deflates, and the price of goods massively decreases, it matters more now - but deflation is not as common. I think you have to diversify and pick goods which are usually more immune to market fluctuations, and land is by no means something which depreciates in value, so long as the world's population rises.";4;3;False;RoseElise;dqejqjz;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

This is misleading. Money is a standard, agreed-on way to represent wealth. No-one who's paying attention believes money itself is worth anything. It's a token used to represent wealth.

The value of money can be a bubble if the wealth represented by the money is much less than the value of the money according to some external measure.

"Most of the demand for gold is from the jewelry industry.

If people stopped buying golden jewelry overnight then the price of gold would crash. It's not just valuable because its rare. 

There are metals that are rarer than gold that are less expensive and have a much lower market cap because there are far fewer uses for them.

>It's not much, but maybe $10,000 is not so expensive for something that there will only be 21 million of, ever. Globally for all time, that's quite an exclusive club.

You could make a cryptocoin that there will only ever be 10 of. Scarcity alone is not enough to confer value.

So then the argument is ""well bitcoin isn't just valuable because its artificially scarce, its because it will be so useful as a currency in the future!"". Then any time you bring up all the problems with bitcoins use as a currency (which is getting worse over time), the argument switches to ""silly rabbit, bitcoin isn't mean to be used as currency, its a store of value!"". Which hopefully you've recognized leads to a circular argument.

All this is to avoid facing the real reason bitcoin is so valuable is because its caught in a cycle where people buy it, it increases in value (because of artificial scarcity), then other people buy it because its increasing in value and so it increases in value further. Otherwise called a speculative bubble.

Of course, if the market completely collapses I still lose the lot, but that's only going to happen if something seriously undermines it as a currency - for example if somebody figures out a way to reverse engineer a private key, or we find out a state level actor has spent the last few years brute forcing keys with millions of dollars worth of kit, and now possesses a significant number of the keys.";53;4;False;TheDisapprovingBrit;dqekozg;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png

Largely, yes. Other than for a few use cases like making donations or for use in less-stable markets, Bitcoin isn't the best for transactional currency - you pay to buy Bitcoin then pay to spend it. All while if you believe in it in the long term, knowing that you're spending something that very soon will be worth a lot more than the product you're buying with it (see 10,000 BTC pizza).

"Then you better call your fucking doctor! 

Because all trendlines say it's going to 90k by summer. It moved up $117 since I started writing this. If you understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies, then the following is no surprise:

>less than ***.1%*** of the general population are using bitcoin in one capacity or another.

The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.  

The reason is simple: supply and demand. There are a limited supply of the bitcoins, and even less available in liquidity available to buy, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $100M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 

Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. 10k in the morning. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.

Then times it by ten. 

Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 

That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins.

"Bitcoin All Time High is an erection that lasts too long. Bitcoin ATCH can develop without financial stimulus and doesn’t go away after buying at the previous all time high. There is a risk of having bitcoin ATH after buying more bitcoin and seeing it go higher.

When you have a full bitcoin ATH, no fresh money flows into your checking account. This means that your checking account isn’t getting money, which can damage your credit rating when your checks bounce, because you spent the money on bitcoin at the All Time High.

The result: statements by Satoshi show up with the highest probability as being from Szabo when Satoshi is not an option.  I tested Finney's live statements from prior to his death, and they show up as Finney - as expected.  What this means is that Szabo and Satoshi share the closer textual patterns.

"I don't love Litecoin a whole lot, but it is based very much off of Bitcoin (main changes are block times, max supply, and SegWit) and it actually works. Bitcoin is broken at the moment, and it is very fair to call Litecoin ""improved Bitcoin"" due to it being heavily, heavily influenced by and similar to Bitcoin. It is known to be that. Charlie Lee counts on that for success, as even he has explained before. Until Bitcoin actually works well, people will know it as that. I am not a douche, I am just able to be objective. The ""less security"" thing really doesn't effect the coins network in practice, as it is as dominated by ASIC's as Bitcoin is. And it is a smaller coin, of course it is technically less secure. That doesn't make it insecure.

As long as I am getting downvoted though, I'll say it. PoW, ASIC resistant or not, has major scaling flaws that Litecoin has addressed somewhat, but obviously hasn't fixed. Bitcoin is in need of a better solution. PoS has issues, sure, but it has solved a lot of issues. MimbleWimble technology, somethijng that could be merged with Bitcoin, solves scaling in a more real way (or at least Grin does, a coin in development based on MimbleWimble tech).

"When I am done I might provide detailed results.  To give you an idea of some of the curious high probability data I found, here is a block from Satoshi N.'s original Bitcoin paper:

>The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.


This block appeared from the Szabo Bit gold paper:

>Hal Finney has implemented a variant of bit gold called RPOW (Reusable Proofs of Work). This relies on publishing the computer code for the ""mint,"" which runs on a remote tamper-evident computer. The purchaser of of bit gold can then use remote attestation, which Finney calls the transparent server technique, to verify that a particular number of cycles were actually performed.


Another example produced by my code:

Satoshi:

>3. Timestamp Server
>The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post[2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash.

Szabo:
>However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was.


A bit of research reveals that curiously Satoshi claims to be unaware of work by Finney and Szabo, but this is very unlikely because, as an example, these blocks match similarity in both content and ordering from both papers.

">a lot of people do but then get silenced or banned when they ask about why bitcoin has gone from a p2p electronic cash system (as outlined in the white paper) to just a store of value

This comes up a lot, and everytime we have to reexplain that decentralisation is expensive and it is physically impossible to scale to a global cash system without compromising decentralisation. And then the obvious /r/btc brigade (while an obvious BCH pump and dump is underway) just scream ""BUT THE FEES!!!"". I have no problem silencing people who want to come in here, disregard debate, and cause FUD. In my experience on this sub, those who show a willingness to debate and learn usually get good replies. Moderation is necessary.

Honestly, if you come here thinking that the reason for the existence of the white paper is anything but ""trustlessness"", I don't know what to tell you; that concept is hammered away in almost every sentence of the introduction.

Blockchains aren't interesting because they are efficient (they are not), they are interesting because they are hyper redundant, trustless, and resistant to change.

The similarities between Kek and Pepe were striking enough as it was, but Kek also has a female alter ego, or nemesis, that takes the form of a snake. This was quickly taken to symbolise Clinton, a universally reviled character within the /pol/ community. ""

"> No one is coming with guns, it's a too simplistic analogy.

LOL how do you think the US and most other countries were created?

> I'm glad that I have good public services

Good for you.  Not everyone wants every service.  Some people use disproportionately more than others.  It is not morally correct to force people into such a system.

> Bob will have his say when he will go vote

LOL, ok.  Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.  Again, popular vote doesn't make something right.  Look at civil rights, for one.

> You'd pay far more if all the public services were private.

Wrong.  The private sector drives costs down for many reasons, not least of all is because people are directly paying their own money for their purchases.

> battling against potential monopoly that aren't subject to competition (yes it's possible in a free market)

Then give me an example of one that exists without govt help.

> if you're rich and have to pay a ticket for drunk driving, it will actually be calculated proportionally to your revenue : this is fair.

Define ""fair"".  Not that I'm for such a system in the first place, but are you familiar with how percentages work?  Why wouldn't say, 10% of your monthly revenue be fair?  You could argue a flat fee is ""unfair"", whatever that means, but why do people like you need your percentages to also be ""progressive""?

> To me, property isn't a ""natural"" right.

Are you property?  Do you own yourself?  Your children?  If not, who does?  If so, why are you able to ""own"" yourself without consent of The State, but not other physical property?

> a nice majority of people do not consider that taxation is theft since the libertarians have a hard time winning any election.

This is the Appeal to Popularity fallacy and has zero sway on what is moral.

If you think nation-states are so great that's fine, you can elect to be governed by one and play by all the rules and have all the public services everyone in that group wants.  If you don't want to be, you should be allowed to secede on your own property (call it a nation-state of one person if you love the concept so much).  Or maybe a group of land owners want to form their own country or co-op with their own rules, why should a State stop them?

Ancaps believe that as long as were making rules and ideals about what should be, all interactions should be voluntary.  So, that means people must affirmatively consent to their governance.
