Yo, this is months later... I had to literally threaten to (meaning file to) sue Coinbase to get my own money.  Those fucking asshats froze my account for the better part of a year.  I finally got access again and immediately removed my holdings to a more secure location.  My BTC is now much safer.;1;1;False;rdhotchilipprs84;f4uc480;Why Bitcoin?;cz65ds;https://i.redd.it/fxx69x6haek31.jpg
I think most people haven’t figured out that a holding site can short sell...  sell your BTC and hope the price drops so they can buy it back.  When they sell it, they invest in other ventures.  If the price rises too much, they can just fold.  If the price drops, that and the interest are profit.  That’s the brilliance of bitcoin, it ties up money with no interest.  It’s the bond every treasury would love to issue!;1;0;False;Vetinery;f4udx6d;Why Bitcoin?;cz65ds;https://i.redd.it/fxx69x6haek31.jpg
