"I have watched the BBC documentary and listened to the unabridged American Kingpin audio book.

Based on these, I dont think Ulbricht is a hero in anyway, in fact he was guilty as charged and probably guilty of a lot more. Nevertheless, I do think his sentence was too harsh because of mitigating circumstances. He is a victim of leading a sheltered self-centered life, the anonymity of the web and cryptocurrencies, and hubris (which is something very common in all of history).

Drugs, legal or illegal, are much more insidious than you think. I think it is far more likely that Ulbricht's ""libertarian"" philosophy was more a result of his penchant for drugs than an actual result of deep thought and reasoning. Think about it -- you take an illegal drug and it makes you feel great. What is your next thought? Naturally, your next thought is ""why is this illegal? this is wonderful! Everybody should be able to do this!"" So what is going on here? You are not thinking about society as a whole. You are thinking about yourself. You are thinking that everybody is like you and will probably have wonderful times with drugs if given the chance. Of course you will admit that not everybody will have the same reaction or will use them wisely, but that is their problem and you should not be restricted in your life by other people's problems. Do you see what is going on here? The drug is biasing you. You are involved in it now. You are not an uninterested bystander.

So Ulbricht isnt a hero. His political views were largely the result of his drug use. But those political views were only part of his incentive to start the Silk Road. The other was money -- how do we know this? Well, if he wasn't interested in personal gain, his take would have been something like an average salary (well average for somebody living in San Francisco) plus expenses of running the business. So what does taking a large amount of money represent in this case? Hubris and greed. And this also explains why he tried to protect his web empire with violence. But the flaw of hubris and greed has been a character flaw recognized throughout society.

On top of this, he really wasnt that smart -- this is especially clear when he started trying to kill people. He knew how uncertain things are on the internet, yet when bitcoins were apparently taken by one of his employees, even though he knew almost immediately that this employee been arrested by the police, he still had no doubt that his employee had stolen from him. So he immediately tried to have his employee beaten and then killed. Wait a minute, how did he know that his employee's computer hadnt been hacked or the police themselves hadnt turned him by threatening prosecution? These are distinct possibilities to any half wit.

And he put a hit on a guy who took money from the Dead Pirate Roberts? Oh wait, I am sure the police would never suspect him, the owner of a multi million dollar website who had been robbed, with murder/conspiracy. ;)

You see? Drugs make you stupid, you lose your situational awareness, you adjust your political view to justify your penchant or habit. So this guy was really flawed and not that smart on top of it. But that is human, and he was dangerous. He certainly deserves punishment, AND a substantial enough punishment to discourage others like him because there are many like him out there.

He should have received 20 to 40 years in jail, and to never profit a dime from what he did on the Silk Road.";1;1;False;InigoooMontoya;dn4wwgl;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
"As unstable as these systems are, they also produce high growth rates as investment capital is readily available, and savings don't leak.

The hard part is balancing growth with capital adequacy requirements. Honestly systems like Canada's with no reserve requirements and solely capital adequacy requirements are probably better. Canada also has one of the best track records in managing recessions.

Full reserve systems like the Chicago plan are untested so it's hard to say if we'd see the same growth rates.

"Do fractional reserve banking systems produce more growth than full reserve systems would over the long term when you factor in how much wealth is destroyed during the crises and the bailouts that happen afterward?

A slower growth rate without periodic catastophies might perform better.

Another factor here is that by keeping interest rates low, you deprive the economy of the due dilligence that would otherwise be brought to bear against proposed business plans.  So investment is evenly spread across the space of proposed business plans, instead of a system that judges risk.  Thats inefficient and lowers growth.

Assuming we can't really know the answer to that on theoretical grounds, what do you think will happen with bitcoin?

I think it will relieve central banks of their ability to do QE and force full reserve.  I think for that reason governments will fight it but lose.

"That's true.  However, whilst still limited to a few businesses, then a lot like cash, at some point, it has to turn into real money and go through the banking system (which monitors everyone's transactions a lot more than most people realise).

I agree though: once an entire ""closed loop"" of business can be conducted via bitcoin (say: one guy farming and selling his goods for bitcoin, then using that bitcoin to rent a server that some colo company has, whilst the colo company also pays for its utilities (broadband, electric, rent) in bitcoin), then there's a good chance.

However, even then, all of these companies would need to be very careful about anonymising their wallet use via vpn+tor or something, and keeping those anonymouse wallets entirely separate from their other business/private wallets.  That is... as far as I understand bitcoin anonymity, which isn't very far ;)

Tricky business.  And bear in mind that while all that is happening (and especially IF that happens more and more), government will be upping its game in regards to analysing and monitoring transactions.

"In most situations no one would owe federal taxes on a house (or bitcoin) sold for $1. There are only three types of tax that I could see people thinking might apply:

* Capital gains - Selling a house for $1 would not trigger capital gains tax for the seller, since it's less than he originally paid and there is no gain. End of story. 
* Gift tax - The actual fair market value in excess of $1 *would* be considered a taxable gift, however, it just dips into the seller's unified lifetime gift/estate tax exemption (the first $5.4 million is tax free). 
* Income tax - Gifts are never taxable income for the recipient. As an added bonus, they also get to keep the giver's tax basis, rather than having it reset to $1.

So no one is paying any tax at the time of sale. The buyer might eventually have to pay capital gains down the road when he sells the house, if the proceeds are greater than the original seller's tax basis.

Despite the waste, you do realize that taxes pay for all the infrastructure and services you use on a daily basis right? Anarchy would fucking suck.

Bitcoin will hopefully eventually become recognized as a true currency, but that's years down the road. Right now the best thing people can do to bring that day about is to run a full node, use bitcoin to buy things, and tell others about it. 

You're never going to get true anonymity with evasion of taxes. Anything that provides such will probably be banned or regulated into obscurity. But you can get into the ground floor of a new financial system that isn't subject to complete government control and will be able to avoid such shenanigans and outsider influence once it becomes widely adopted. You'll probably make a bit of money along the way too.

No, bitcoin isn't anonymous, isn't unregulated, isn't a tax shelter. It is decentralized, is a promising new system, and is still very young.

> I was sold on the decentralized aspect but this is as centralized as it gets.

The decentralization is in the fact that no government controls the currency, the users (node runners) do. Yes they can regulate its interaction with the government-controlled banking/money system, but they cannot fiddle with the currency itself like issuing more bitcoins, for example. There will never ever be more than 21 million. That isn't the case with FIAT.

Though as a buyer, you have considerably less risk of anything like that. 

The only truly anonymous way to handle bitcoin is to buy AND SELL offline. Trying to deal with foreign exchanges is a good way to get scammed. Why sell offline? Because the instant you make a purchase with that bitcoin address, it is tied to you and can be followed through the blockchain unless you use something like a tumbler which is *literally* money laundering and is very suspicious to the IRS and FBI.

"Hence the gray area. In this case, with current legislation, you would pay cap gains twice if you went USD>BTC>ETH>USD, assuming you made money on both BTC and ETH.

Neither BTC nor ETH are currency, therefore if you make money on them you pay taxes on the gain. Since they aren't currency, you don't actually trade BTC for ETH either, but BTC for an agreed dollar value of ETH.

This is why the legal classification as *currency* is so important. Property is taxed. Currency is... currency. You don't pay taxes on EUR>USD>YEN>Whatever.

This is why this legislation is damaging in the long run because it relegates bitcoin to something like gold. You can use it some places (pawn shops mostly), but it isn't currency, is converted to a dollar value before buying something with it, and therefore cap gains taxable.

"Let's assume you use coinbase. Remember all that intrusive verification you did to use the service? That's for compliance with KYC/AML (know your customer, anti money laundering) laws. It also means that any transaction you make is available to the IRS.

After that, the immutable blockchain is your cookie crumb trail that lets auditors, law enforcement, or anyone with a little free time trace your money.

Bank account > Coinbase > Trezor > Wherever

Regardless of where you sent it to, the IRS will always know you bought it if you used a US compliant exchange. After that, it's really on you to prove you don't owe taxes on 5k/BTC because you sold it all yesterday at 3k/BTC.

Also on your question about sales tax, you don't have to worry about that because that's a seller liability, not a buyer liability. The reason you have both is because bitcoin is not a currency in the eyes of the IRS, it is property.

How would you deal with people who don't have the means to survive and don't have the means to get it peacefully? Wouldn't they have to coerce others (war, robbery, violence) to give it to them or starve? 

Coercion will be around as long as greed is around, and greed has been around literally as long as sentient life has, *education system or not*. Even cavemen killed eachother over food. Even toddlers fight over toys.

"Ding! 

And not just keep a record of, but pay taxes on too when April rolls around.

Really what you're doing is ""selling bitcoin for X"". X could be coffee, a car, whatever. But since bitcoin is considered property instead of money, you have to pay capital gains on any *realized* gain. 

If I could sell TSLA stock for X, it would be the same thing (not that I would want to). I'm sure I could probably find someone to sell me their car in exchange for some shares of Tesla, and if the stock is worth more than when I bought it, I will ""realize"" a gain by getting more value out of it than went in, thus having to pay capital gains. If you just let your bitcoin sit, it could go to a million per BTC but that would be untaxed ""unrealized"" gain, until you sold it. Unless you're renouncing your citizenship, of course. Then the IRS has no problem taxing your unrealized gain because you won't be around to tax the actual gain later.

However, there's still a lot of gray area. If you bought bitcoin and kept it as bitcoin when moving it around, you shouldn't have any problems. But if you bought bitcoin and exchanged it for etherium, you could be subject to cap gains because you're ""selling bitcoin for etherium"".

Also, even WHEN/IF this bill is passed, you'll want to keep track of all your <$600 transactions, because if you get audited, saying ""I bought a lot of coffee with bitcoin"" isn't going to cut it with the IRS when they ask where all those bitcoins they know you bought went.";2;2;False;certifiedintelligent;dn4crr9;US bill has been made to remove taxes from BTC transactions under $600;70jw8b;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/u-s-bill-would-ease-bitcoin-tax-regulations-for-small-transactions/

a partial excerpt:

""Reps. Polis & Schweikert introduce Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act in Congress
Bipartisan bill will make it much easier to use Bitcoin to pay for every day goods and services. 

BY JERRY BRITO / September 7, 2017

In April, Coin Center explained how the tax laws affecting digital currency transactions create serious friction for consumers and merchants and discourages the use of Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) as an everyday payment method. We also outlined how Congress could address this problem. Since then we have been working with congressional staff to develop legislation that would address the problem, and today I’m thrilled that with the leadership of Rep. Jared Polis and Rep. David Schweikert, co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act has been introduced in Congress.

The bill does two things. First, it creates a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency transactions for goods or services. Today, if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoins, you’ll have to calculate and report any gains that you experienced and pay tax on any gains. Under the bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt, so you’d neither have to worry about keeping track of gains on all the little purchases you make, nor would you owe taxes on those small gains. This mirrors the same kind of exemption that foreign currency enjoys today and we think it’s a simple and fair way to avoid discouraging the use of cryptocurrency.

Now, there are many other transactions above $600, such as getting in and out of investment positions, on which capital gains tax will be owed. Today, you are responsible for keeping track of and accurately reporting every cent of gain. This is in contrast to your stock broker, who provides you and the IRS with a 1099-B form accounting all your gains and losses. Indeed, in answering Coin Center’s amicus brief opposing the IRS’s unprecedented and overbroad John Doe summons against Coinbase users, the Department of Justice noted that, “If Congress had subjected bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase to similar reporting requirements as those imposed on an online stock broker or a barter exchange, no John Doe summons to Coinbase would likely have been necessary[.]”

We’re not sure if such informational reporting requires an act of Congress, or whether the IRS could have provided for it through rulemaking and has simply opted not to. Whatever the case, the other thing the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act would do is require the Treasury Department to issue guidelines for informational reporting on digital currency transactions for which capital gains is due.""

"The US Government is not legimate authority to decide which amount of BTC is to be taxed or not or how to. It is the same for example when the US Government would make a law and a regulation for the russian rubel and the Kreml how to tax their citizen. Or people on the Mars, if there were any. Thats simply not their business, we live in the cryptoworld, which is and always should be outside the reach of us Government law and the enforcement entities.
The US Government does not provide any useful services for the cryptocommunity (the actually slow down the development), so that they dont have a legitimate right to charge or to tax or get sth. out of it.
Technically we should keep our privacy, so even if they want to tax they simply cannot do that.

"On the contrary, bitcoin is the solution and the map and the guide, it also happens to be popular.

The solution: a decentralized monetary system that is free from any one group or person's influence, is easy to use, and relies on majority of consensus of users in order to make changes to the system. It's not just a picture, because the developers actually created the solution and are actively participating in it's development.

The map: system exists > system becomes popular > system becomes stable independent currency. If system becomes more popular than FIAT, system becomes default financial system. 

The guide: The developers and contributors, who identify problems with the solution and make changes to it and the map, leading to a better overall end. The enthusiasts who actively participate in advocation, lobbying, and other activities to increase adoption and guide discourse.

Lastly, they have enough people who believe in their cause to actually participate in it.

Wouldnt work. First, you cant reverse the transaction on the blockchain nor can you order anyone to do so because you dont control their provate keys the way Amazon or Paypal just control your payment method.

Congress has oversight of the Fed and there are confirmation process for members of the FOMC

edit: the Fed’s Board of Governors is subject to an audit every year by the account services firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

Where it gets a bit murkier is that the 12 Federal Reserve District Banks are not audited using the same GAAP standards, according to Ford. “They don’t use the rules they enforce on banks,” he says.

Horwitz suggests more could be done. “It is not audited in the way many critics would like, with a full accounting of its holdings, and especially what it has done since 2007,” Horwitz says. He says the Fed “publishes information on its balance sheet, and that info is a key part of monetary policy. However, it is true that it’s never undergone a complete audit comparable to what a private-sector firm might.”
