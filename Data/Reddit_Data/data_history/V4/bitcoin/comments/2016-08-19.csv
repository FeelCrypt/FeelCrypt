"You're severely misinterpreting my post. I'm not talking about who is the bigger military power. I'm talking about who poses the bigger threat to my country. It makes little difference to the penguin if it's eaten by a tiger or leopard seal. But the penguin has excellent relations with the tiger, it lives far away and has never expressed any interest in the penguins other than open trade whereas the leopard seal lives close and has a habit of eating penguins like Georgia and Krim, and has made ill-concealed threats to continue doing so.  


US generals do not have publicly displayed maps on their walls where my country is annexed. The US has never occupied us, invaded us or waged war on us, nor have they even threatened to invade. US officials have never spoken publicly about the US future, where the buffer states are forcibly brought back in the fold.  

So yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure the US doesn't pose as much of a threat **to me** as Russia.";1;0;False;lowhangingfruit1;d6nvl0k;NSA hacked!
