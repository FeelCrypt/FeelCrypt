"Bitcoin is far more volatile than stocks, which is a bad thing if seeking less risk, which is what you want to do when the stock market is tanking, you fucking dumbass. You'd only be mitigating losses if crypto moved opposite of stocks, which isn't a reasonable assumption, at all. If you're seeking less risk you go for assets with lower standard deviation (volatility), not higher.

You're probably thinking of diversifying to avoid correlation, but are new to playing make believe investor so you don't know what you're actually doing yet. It's ok, we all learn somehow, and ""diversify"" is still a good thing to have learned even if you could have learned it from pretty much any movie involving the stock market.

2.- There is an immediate solution that would relieve the problem temporarily (increasing block size) while we have the other sophisticated solutions implemented, and there are devs that are willing to make the change but the Core guys in control of the repo won't allow it.

"I'm largely in agreement with you.  I do think, however, that we are discussing two slightly different things.

The attack described here is about the attacker rebroadcasting low-fee tx's to prevent them from aging out.  They are not necessarily creating new TXs.  I can use myself as a real world example of this.  In the beginning of december, I tried to move some BTC from my hot wallet to an exchange and used a custom fee for it.  Evidently, that fee was too low to be processed and the TX still has not confirmed - more than one month later.

I resolved to wait the two-ish weeks to let the transaction age-out before trying again with a higher fee - instead of attempting an RBF or some of the other wallet-clearing techniques that people claim can get you out of this situation.  Unfortunately, my TX has been used in this attack, and I've witnessed it rebroadcast several times - the most recent was January 3rd.  This has prevented the TX from aging out of the mempool and unlocking my funds.

In this instance my mistake is being used to flood the network, instead of some newly created transaction.

It should be possible to help defend against these attacks by doing something such as adding a creation date to the TX itself, so rebroadcasting it doesn't just update it's time to live in the mempool (or can at least be configured to be ignored by the recieving node).  At minimum this allows the sending wallet to automatically unlock unconfirmed transactions that are older than X time for its own keys.

While we're adding configurable settings, it should also be possible to set a minimum Value threshold to a node, so that it removes TXs below some total value (measured as TX + Fee) from its internal mempool.  This would at least require an attacker to dedicate more money to an attack - because they cannot use someone elses money (like in my case) or just spam 1sat+0fee TXs ad infinitum.";1;0;False;enigmapulse;dsfiz2v;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

"Let me back up.

 - Anyone can create millions of zero or low fee transactions per second at basically no cost... and fill up mempools globally.   In fact Bitcoin has been under a sustained attack of this nature for over a year.  ETH also has sporadic attacks.   (Other alts are basically not under attack and so get to strut around proclaiming superiority until they too witness what happens when a well-funded attacker goes after then,)

 - So please assume that, at all times, the system is being flooded with low value TX and that the system is always ""full"".   There is no 1500/2000 situation.   Instead, popular cryptos are *always* at capacity with low-value Tx flooding the system.

 - With ETH.  All nodes on the system must ""keep up"" with the state machine.  If an attacker creates enough cheap tx that are slower to execute on some nodes and not others, the whole system starts locking up.   

 - ETH fixes this by hard-forking the entire system enforcing a global minimum rates charged for various operations.   This works. 
 It fixes the problem, keeps spammers out, but can cause things to get artificially expensive if ETH's value goes up (right now some simple smart contracts can cost over $200 to execute).   And it doesn't actually prevent someone from killing ETH, it just makes it more expensive.

 - BTC's response to excessive TPS is to cap the blocks, keeping the VPS about the same, and causing increased fees when under attack.   BTC itself never locks up or crashes no matter how aggressive the attack.   Fortunately, fees also drive up security and mining investment.   So they aren't paid ""for nothing"".   Indeed, the high fees we pay now are deepening ASIC investment, mining development, etc.

 - If Bitcoin weakens the security of the system to accommodate smaller tx, we actually reduce the security of those million dollar transfers that drive-up our VPS.   And we make it less likely that people doing big transfers will trust Bitcoin if there's no way for them to pay for priority.  Sure, we gain TPS.   But a loss in security is not acceptable.

 - The average BTC tx is estimated at $84K.   So from a VPS throughput standpoint, BTC is the king... beating all other cryptos.

 - The problem might be your definition of throughput.   

 - It's obviously (to me) ""value per second"" (VPS) that we need to optimize for, not tx/sec (TPS).     TPS is nice, but can never come at the expense of security of VPS.

If the exchanges would be connected with a lightning channel, and my assumption is true, that might take enough strain off the network to basically bring down the fees back into the dollar range. Now connect one exchange directly with bitpay, and any user who has a channel with his exchange can connect to any exchange and pay with bitcoin without making more than one transaction.

Antilia is a private home in South Mumbai, India. It is owned by Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries, which includes a staff of 600 to maintain the residence 24 hours a day.

As of November 2014, it is deemed to be the world's most expensive residential property, after Buckingham Palace, which is designated as a crown property. It is thus the world's most expensive private residential property, valued over $1 billion.

"More presumption. SNAP varies by state, maybe that's the factor, but I did not lie. At the time I received it I had 0 income and was hospitalized for several months. It put the food on the table and I am grateful the assistance it provided. Due to the same factors, I was also on Medical Assistance (MA), what my state calls their Medicaid implementation. My state buys a blue cross plan and is accepted everywhere blue cross is. All my doctors from my old private plan took my MA plan. No one questioned it in any way, I live and receive medical care in an upscale area. The only trouble I had with providers was dentists.

I completed a 4-year degree with Pell grants. I never paid in and never took out loans. I worked to pay my day to day bills. It is possible I received a few hundred a semester in a needs-based scholarship, but the Pell grant covered 98% of the bill. A check of a 4-year state college near me shows they charge $241.00 per credit or $5784 for two 12 cr semesters.  No major difference from when I did it. People who choose to pile up loans by not working or going to a school that charges $30k/year in tuition are electing to do it. Better options exist but if you feel you need to have a BMW vs a Toyota, you will pay for it in the end. 

I could go back and forward with you on why you are wrong and how you don't have a clue what you are talking about, but there is no point arguing with someone who has already made up their mind. Cheers. ";-1;0;False;andy378;dse0xlz;Bitcoiners be like 😂;7oyba2;https://i.redd.it/srikkyu2cu801.jpg

"I know you’re getting downvoted, but I am American who is literally in India right now for a wedding and unless you see it, it can be hard for westerners to understand. The entire resort was rented for 3 days so 200+ guests can eat, drink and stay for free at the expense of the brides parents. This cost minimally hundreds of thousands of dollars. Less than a mile away there are hundreds of people sleeping in the street.

A lot of the animosity comes from the fact that India is very very heavily with bribery and corruption, and the wealthy disproportionately utilize this (ask anyone about anytime they were pulled over, arrested, etc). Not to mention savings accounts generate %8/annual while mortgages can top 10%, resentment towards the ultra wealthy who are only getting more wealthy utilizing the exact vehicles that are shafting the poor is pretty fair. Not the mention the obscene emphasis on family over everything and you can see how vast wealth travels within the family through supporting daily business ventures, inheritance, marriages within tight knit communities, etc. Never leaving the family.

"Again, not true due to failure to see gradients.

Let’s take your use of “democratic” for example; America is not a democracy, and was not intended to be. It is a representative Republic. There has never been a pure democracy in the recorded history of government (no, not in ancient Athens either). So how democratic are we? Pretty democratic, relatively speaking.

Similarly, we can have a generally “free market” with some regulation. Yes those regulations are determined by the government / judicial system, which was set up with checks and balances, and as a representation of the will of the people, albeit an imperfect one.

Is any human system perfect? That doesn’t mean we should allow obvious imperfections, deceit and/or outright fraud to take place in our systems.

"> anarcho capitalism 

Actually there is no such thing in the real world, it only exists in discussion boards.  Capitalists cannot function in a system without rules.  It is a just a knee-jerk reaction to over-regulation and a few people who want an excuse not to pay their fair share of taxes (and a few mentally ill people).  It is funny to watch the self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalists use all the benefits of the system and then claim they don't want to pay because some of the money will be used to fund war.

"## Yarrrr:

Adam Samson
JANUARY 9, 2018

Jamie Dimon says he “regrets” his now infamous criticism of bitcoin, in which he called the cryptocurrency a “fraud”.

The JPMorgan Chase chief executive on Tuesday softened the comments he made at a banking conference in September, saying in an interview on FOX Business Network, a US television station, that “I regret making them”.

Mr Dimon said that he personally is “not interested in the subject at all”. However, he said that blockchain, the ledger system that powers bitcoin and is also being used by an increasing number of companies for record keeping, “is real”.

He added that initial coin offerings need to be reviewed “individually”. ICOs in which investors pay in cryptocurrency for a company’s “tokens” have been the subject of fraud alerts from US regulators since they provide few investor protections.

Mr Dimon is one of the highest-profile executives on Wall Street. His remarks in September were met with anger from many in the cryptocurrencies community, but also echoed by other top executives, including Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock.";3;0;False;SAKUJ0;dsf9tzl;"Jamie Dimon: ""I regret"" calling bitcoin a fraud";7p6jar;https://www.ft.com/content/e04e359a-e9e9-3f8e-8e2f-3f4373e5efb0

Bitcoin will die because it is stupid, too. It has already shown this. No one wants that trash. No one sane.

The only real use it has is to avoid stupid laws. Better to eliminate the stupid laws to begin with. Cowardly humans avoid changing the laws and instead choose the cowardly path of avoidance.

Bitcoin is built on speculation. It is all about investing to build money on nothing. It is a coinage built on nothing. it is nothing, and it will crash and burn and fall and die, within 20 years. It will be nothing, because it is nothing. Nothing but a mechanism for speculation. And since it has no basis in reality, no collateral, so to speak, it will die soon, without any doubt.

>Jamie Dimon says he “regrets” his now infamous criticism of bitcoin, in which he called the cryptocurrency a “fraud”.

>The JPMorgan Chase chief executive on Tuesday softened the comments he made at a banking conference in September, saying in an interview on FOX Business Network, a US television station, that “I regret making them”.

>Mr Dimon said that he personally is “not interested in the subject at all”. However, he said that blockchain, the ledger system that powers bitcoin and is also being used by an increasing number of companies for record keeping, “is real”.

>He added that initial coin offerings need to be reviewed “individually”. ICOs in which investors pay in cryptocurrency for a company’s “tokens” have been the subject of fraud alerts from US regulators since they provide few investor protections.

>Mr Dimon is one of the highest-profile executives on Wall Street. His remarks in September were met with anger from many in the cryptocurrencies community, but also echoed by other top executives, including Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock.

"It doesn't ask me to pay to read it... you in the US? Here's the article:

> Jamie Dimon says he “regrets” his now infamous criticism of bitcoin, in which he called the cryptocurrency a “fraud”.

> The JPMorgan Chase chief executive on Tuesday softened the comments he made at a banking conference in September, saying in an interview on FOX Business Network, a US television station, that “I regret making them”.

> Mr Dimon said that he personally is “not interested in the subject at all”. However, he said that blockchain, the ledger system that powers bitcoin and is also being used by an increasing number of companies for record keeping, “is real”.

> He added that initial coin offerings need to be reviewed “individually”. ICOs in which investors pay in cryptocurrency for a company’s “tokens” have been the subject of fraud alerts from US regulators since they provide few investor protections.

> Mr Dimon is one of the highest-profile executives on Wall Street. His remarks in September were met with anger from many in the cryptocurrencies community, but also echoed by other top executives, including Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock.

"This is correct. I can call Jamie a dick, and then say that I regret calling him a dick. This doesn't change the fact that I still think he is a dick, I just regret saying it out loud. 

WHY does he regret it? That is the question I would like the answer to.
