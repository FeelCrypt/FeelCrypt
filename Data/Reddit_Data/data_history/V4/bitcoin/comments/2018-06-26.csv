 Oh. My. God. Becky, Look at that price!  But  I'm sure this technology will have influance on all spheres of life. Good example of nowadays project that already make life better is Socratus, a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. Having studied the project I can say that it is reliable, has a transparent team Please, check this out and say what you think, I would like to hear some thoughts from the side as I am thinking of investing in Socratus and need advice.;1;0;False;CcryptoAdviser;e1b9ztj;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/
 Welcome to decentralized unregulated money. I searched just yesterday new project for me - Socratus. I think it is the one with huge potential to be big! All moments that are important for me while choosing the project to invest - the transparency and background of the team, the product, the idea - they all passed the test and now I can recommend it.They seem really interesting but would love to hear your opinion. ;1;1;False;CcryptoAdviser;e1b9bdj;This is NOT OK.

"> 500% is doing well, are you not grasping that?

500% in itself is good but not if you invest too little. There have been plebty of shitcoins that have done that last year anyway. 500,000% or invest a lot more than Greg did would be a lot better.

>Intentionally using it incorrectly? Well as long as you did that intentionally sure.

>Nobody cares about that but you, you’re still copying and pasting irrelevant bullshit to try and win an argument you auto lost in your initial reply. Why you keep bringing up quotes from elsewhere is beyond me. Nobody was even disputing the stuff you’re quoting.

You rather obnoxiously keep questioning my knowledge on things but you foolishly seem to think that you are inscrutable.

All of your answers have been cop outs. Or if you prefer non-answers, non-argumnets. You still have yet to address the point about Bitcoin's (reducing) supply being a reason to hold. There, I used simpler words for you.

>first 2 years of Reddit no posts about BTC

Wrong, as usual.

No doubt I could find older ones but I'm not wasting any more time over you.

"I thought you were going to block me?

>Your link doesn’t prove any points you’ve made lol. Nowhere in that posts has you confirming you’re invested

That wasn't the point of the link. Just shows how you twist things.

Enough. You're a trolling cunt without a single argument.

 Currently 4 out of 5 top posts in this sub are about bch.  It's good that the Crypto has a Chief now, hope this will help a lot to Cryptocurrency world.  Has somebody heard about Socratus? I saw users here discussing the project few times. I decided to check it out by myself and really liked the project and the idea! Guess, they can be trusted (just look at their partners ([ http://socratus.io/](http://socratus.io/) ) I can recommend you to check this project as well. ;1;0;False;CcryptoAdviser;e1b9ni8;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg
