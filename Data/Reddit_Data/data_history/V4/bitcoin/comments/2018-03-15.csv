"I am against all significant injustices, like inhumane treatment of animals, but just because it's on my mind I hope I might provide some good info, because I take it you don't know a ton about the cartels. In all honestly I think it is important to know, because it will give you an intense and abject understanding of the bad out there, and the reality of (as opposed to the mere potential for) human suffering. You learn about things like the animal abuse, holocaust, or ISIL, or militant groups in Africa, but it is hard to feel a true sense of agency towards them because one is typically far removed, especially if you are American.

But man, Mexico is our neighbor, full of culture and relevance, and corruption and suffering of absolutely equal weight to the other things I have mentioned. It will change your perspective, hopefully in a beneficially realistic way, assuming you haven't already come into INTIMATE contact with the depths of the immorality present in our world, in our backyard everyday. And so I highly recommend reading wikipedia and articles about it, but I would say only watch videos (particularly live leak) if you want to really change your understanding of pain. But if you can handle it, it will help broaden your perspective in a good, realistic way.

"Damn man, I agree that we should focus inwardly, but from drug prohibition (which today's cartels were born out of) to climate change (which America is the leading contributor to and causes deaths in other countries daily, like the floods in Asia and India) we have an intense effect on the world around us that we shouldn't shun. I mean working out our own issues could even go hand in hand with it.

Nationalism has it's benefits, like improving the lives of those inside the country, but can also lead to selfish interests... such as the U.S. doing what it can to control the dollar and keep it's value (not just price) above others so that it can effectively impose sanctions (and I'm not saying this is totally bad, but has more selfish and outwardly negative effects that positive), or strict immigration laws. And what are strict immigration laws if not shunning others out of fear and self interest. Again, it has plenty of value and positive effects to be had, but there are so many more negatives that come to my mind.

Many issues in our country and in others could be better solved through acting together as a global society, but people are afraid and nationalism (from tribe to city-state to state to country to species) has always been strong, and inherently selfish.";1;0;False;jackblackninja;dvqku80;The latecomer’s BTC journey;83qeea;https://v.redd.it/hqzbut8or7l01

"Stocks... are cheaper and have earnings to back up their valuations. I’m glad you have a healthy attitude about crypto but if you’re going to make just a few hundred bucks a month, why not sell puts on stocks you wouldn’t mind owning? Those profits are more tax advantaged than crypto profits and having a margin brokerage account will help your credit. You wouldn’t even have to pick individual stocks, you could do it on one of the many ETF products that exist today or even entire indexes.

The bonus being that long term, you know any position you get put to you will most likely appreciate... whereas probably 80% of the crypto market is likely to consolidate.

Don’t write off stocks as something purely for rich people! The stock market has been the greatest driver of individual wealth for a hundred years. Crypto is subject to all kinds of unknown risks and is more likely than not, worthless. 

Plus from what I’ve seen, the power consumption of mining is rarely justified by the value mined... unless you live near a vast source of cheap energy which is subject to change quickly ";2;1;False;lewdite;dvqqk7x;Remember: NOBODY went to jail for '08, and now US Senate moves forward with bill, easing regulations on banks;84i8wh;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/banking-bill-vote-mike-crapo/index.html

"This is not really true. You need capital to create product to sell. If you cannot get a loan so you can create your product to sell, you cannot produce. A good example is what if you had a landscaping company. You need $15,000 to buy a small truck to carry landscaping equipment. Your monthly payment will be $350 per month, let's say. Well, you just need 1 contract to cover that expense. Well, without a truck you have ZERO contracts to carry out your work. But, if you can't get the loan of $15k to buy the vehicle, you have no business.

The same is for pretty much ALL small businesses. The banks loan the money assuming your business will be successful. The funny thing is companies like NIKE wouldn't even exist today if it wasn't for them being able to get banks to give them money to buy their shoes imported from a Japanese factory (back in the 60s), then they would have never been able create their brand, their unqiue shoe designs, and go from a small business to a big business. But, they had investors that believed in them, backed them, and they were able to pay for their inventory to sell.

The modern rules on lending that same company would not be able to startup anymore because the banks are no longer legally allowed to lend them money.";1;0;False;GeneticsGuy;dvqzdua;Remember: NOBODY went to jail for '08, and now US Senate moves forward with bill, easing regulations on banks;84i8wh;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/banking-bill-vote-mike-crapo/index.html

"> This rich were responsible for capital allocation to improve productivity. They failed. Now in place of giving up their positions, resigning etc, they continue to kill people's savings by printing money.

I think QE is an absolute shitshow, but please explain to me how QE is the reason that people's savings are dying? Inflation? The thing that the Fed can't hit it's 2% target on despite desperately trying since the GFC? People's savings are dying because they can't find work, which is a different problem than the printing of money. People's savings are dying because they're *still* spending beyond their means.

>the banks would convince people they could afford to get loans above their means

Okay so you're telling me that most adults in America are lemmings that can be *convinced* they can afford a house when they can't? Bullshit. We wanted to buy those things because we're materialistic as a population, which is fine. The banks couldn't convince us of anything we weren't ready to believe ourselves. And honestly, if running a few commercials was enough to convince people to go take out *hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt*, those people got a very education on the reality of personal finance.

> then the banks packaged the bad loans into a product the company that rates the risk of the product was bribed or due to profit, i cant remember. 

Here's an idea, if you don't actually know what happened, don't stand so firmly behind your views because you could be wrong. The banks packaged loans *in general* into mortgage backed securities so that institutions like your parent's pension fund could invest in home mortgages. At the time home mortgages in America were seen as one of the safest investments in the world aside from US Gov't bonds and a few other assets. They were so widely seen as safe *by everyone*, not just the banks, that people who spoke up about the possible risks were ridiculed. Again, this was by *everyone* not just the banks. [Government agencies](https://www.nber.org/digest/apr06/w11643.html) were aware, [random bloggers](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2005/11/housing_bubble_insurance.html) warned us about it, [university publications](https://gbr.pepperdine.edu/2010/08/will-the-sub-prime-meltdown-burst-the-housing-bubble/) talked about it, and even some of the most [successful hedge fund managers *ever*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-rogers/top-investor-sees-u-s-property-crash-idUSL1470530620070314) warned the public about it. 

This idea of ""bad loans"" being packaged together and sold to unwitting investors is also misleading and just popularized by pop culture (The Big Short?) as the *cause* of the collapse, but that's not completely true. It wasn't the fact that there were bad loans in MBS that was the issue, it was the fact that people assumed that none of the bad loans would default at the same time. If you were correct in thinking that banks were intentionally misleading the public into thinking these investments were safe when they know they weren't, why would the banks have had such [large holdings](http://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/mbs/pdf/UDD_2007_101/BSABS_2005-HE3_prospectus.pdf) of what they knew to be bad investments themselves? Maybe it's not that they knew these were bad--maybe they thought, like everyone else, that American housing would never see a systemic and highly correlated collapse across the entire nation. 

That's not to say that there weren't *some* people who knew what they were doing was wrong, but the vast majority of people, including those on Wall Street, thought this was a win win. It would let investors get access to a highly stable asset class to invest in while allowing them to get loans of their books to free up capital to lend more. 

This is what I mean about about the attitude people have of blaming the rich without knowing what actually happened. I mean blame them for everything they did wrong, but you can't offload the irresponsibility of the entire American populous on one group because we were so dumb that ""banks convinced people they could afford to get loans above their means."" I'm sorry but if you convince me that snake oil is a good investment, I'm as much to blame for my decision to invest in it as are you.

>And the banks already paid us back with interest.

That's not the fucking point.  First off, it is immoral and wrong to take things from people without their consent.  I did not consent to giving any of these banks a loan so it doesn't fucking matter if they paid it back.  Also, how the fuck do you think the interest rate is justified for the underlying risk.  If the companies were in a position where they could demonstrate lending to them was low risk they should have no problem procuring capital willingly from the market at an appropriate rate.

But now bitcoin exists so I don't really give a fuck what you people do.  Let them fuck you in your sheep ass again while they tell you it is necessary to stop the bleeding.  

Let them expand the monetary supply to the point the dollar is worthless while you sit there and bah ""Inflation is good!  Inflation is good!"".  It's not my problem anymore.

no one is entitled to a job.  If you work for a company that mismanages itself into bankruptcy, that is just how the cookie crumbles.  When companies fail, if there is a legitimate market need other actors will move to meet that need, often by expansion which would replace shitty poorly managed and poorly capitalized companies with ones that do a better job.

"Banks love regulation. They also love its advocates. It's what perpetuates their existence. As long as they're in place, newly printed money can continue to be funnelled through them. 

Regulations caused the financial crisis. It gave banks free reins to do what they pleased, knowing competitors would be kept out. Just ask yourself: could you start a bank? How much capital would you need to not fall afoul of regulations? Banks are not private corporations. They are appendages of the State. Bitcoin intends to free us from the State, not the banks. Redirect your firepower.

The problem is not with banks but with Central Banks. It is incredible how Central banks got away with no blaming almost when they caused the financial crises by artificially lowering interest rates.;10;2;False;lazarus_free;dvqjf39;Remember: NOBODY went to jail for '08, and now US Senate moves forward with bill, easing regulations on banks;84i8wh;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/banking-bill-vote-mike-crapo/index.html
"To be fair, the went so hardcore in regulations that they made it almost impossible for banks to lend money into people. Even if a bank liked a person's investment idea, or business, they made it essentially against the law to loan them money unless the had X DTI ratio. So many small businesses are unable to get off the ground these days, not because the banks don't want to help them, but because they legally are no longer able to.

In other words, we had a housing crisis due to subprime lending, and dishonest practices where they mixed horrible bank notes in with AAA rated bank notes and repackaged them for investors, and a host of other issues, and they went so far overboard that they basically restricted lending completely to being no longer a Capitalistic venture, where the bank can take the risk and give someone money, to be 100% government regulated. Only the people flush with cash would be able to grow their business.

Something really does need to change in the financial industry because they did go far too overboard on things completely unrelated to the financial crisis, whilst ignoring many other things they should have, all the while giving taxpayer money to these multi-billion dollar banks.
