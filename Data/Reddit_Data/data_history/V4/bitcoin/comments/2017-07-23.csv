I just think he had some sort of lucky mutation that made him interract really well with the Matrix so that's why he can do all that stuff. And him being able to do all that stuff outside of the Matrix, in my head cannon, is because of all the wiring he has inside him, his was a bit weird and it allowed him to connect wirelessly and affect the machines.;2;0;False;Shovi;dkl19fz;Every GPU's worst nightmare;6mjng5;https://i.redd.it/rkwou70jut8z.jpg

"""we"" compromised.    So you admit to working for Jihan & Co.

Very fitting, judging by your constant spamming of anti-bitcoin propaganda & disinformation.

Willy-nilly increasing max block size would only give unscrupulous miners like Jihan & Co even more mining power centralization. It wold push smaller mining outfits with less bandwidth even further off the map.

Trying to claim otherwise is the true mental pretzel twisting, and this is well known on legitimate cryptocurrency forums. No amount of pro-hijacking spam from Jihan & Co will change that.

SegWit, and the other SAFE scaling strategies it enables, is the way forward. After they are fully explored, ways might be found to *safely* tweak block weight (there will be no more max block size with SegWit).";1;1;False;Terminal-Psychosis;dklzw8w;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif

"""The main developers think unnecessary hard forks are bad and want to include many different upgrades when they do one.""

Wouldn't that make any hard fork even more complex, because in thoses multiples differents upgrades, there would be multiples differents reasons for one to disagree on one of them, having a consensus hard to find and therefore making this SegWit process like a trivial thing ? 

On peer-reviewed software developement, in order to get your pull request accepted, you tend to make very atomic changes that you push, so you don't have a BIG changes being rejected for a reason, but instead, you have a lot of little changes accepted, and a little change rejected, that you can individually fix and repush. 

Plus, it allow bug tracking/debugging/reviewing to be way easier :)

"I think it's wrong.

It suggests that developers are adults with control and miners a helpless baby.

Reality is the opposite.

In a work-based network, those who have the computing power are in control.

So much so, that Segwit has not been able to celebrate until the miners with a fantastic consensus have said yes.
When the miners voted in the blockchain, we watched.

As you have noted, more than three alternative Bitcoin client programs have been developed.
While some celebrate a pseudo-battle (BIP 91), the miners make the next move toward checkmate.

"""We"" is those of us that want bigger blocks. I don't work for Jihan, but I own a *lot* of hardware manufactured by Bitmain, and I mine as part of a small, exclusive pool.

But here we go again, with people like you accusing people like me of centralizing, when the overwhelming point of centralization in Bitcoin right now is the governance of the software by a team who *do not believe* in Bitcoin as it exists today, and who's very employment and paychecks *depend* on them developing ""solutions"" to ""the problem"".

There are dozens of mining pools, consisting of thousands of miners like me, most of us on fibre networks and multi-TB storage systems and the freedom to mine with whomever we please. This has increased year by year after the ASIC plateau, and you have the gall and audacity to say *I'm* the one peddling propaganda?

Core and the people that support them in this sub, are anti-capitalists that would feel right at home with antifa. You believe the system is broken and must be changed. You don't believe in the market and free competition. You have spun lies about the importance of running ""non-mining full nodes"". Dirt cheap systems with no economic incentives behind them that provide zero protection, all under the guise that ""the miners are centralizing"". That we're the ones attacking Bitcoin! It's staggering. Many of you even wanted to have your own little ""revolution"" with UASF (and you may still if 2x happens).

It's *us* that provide you with the security, not your useless network of nothing nodes. You can't fire us! The notion is hilarious! But we compete with one another. There are more and more of us as Bitcoin grows, fighting to the death for that reward while you lot sit around calling for revolution or over-engineering complicated solutions to problems that don't exist.

I'm sitting on a 10gbit internet backbone. I have 100's of TB's of storage available to me at little cost. I'm ready to serve the world. I can destroy visa level transactions *today*. I'm a small mining outfit, and I don't know of any others who aren't in a similar situation. If one of my competitors gets pushed off the network because they didn't have the gumption to mine on a decent fibre line, *good*. Survival of the fittest my friend. I don't need your malleability fix. I don't need your lightning network. I don't need your side-chains. I don't need your block weight. I'll take a quadratic hash time fix (although I'm pretty indifferent) and a block size increase but other than that Bitcoin has everything it needs to deliver to the world what it promised. A global, peer-to-peer electronic cash system of sovereign money. Real money, borderless, open and trustless.

2x is the last chance to not split Bitcoin completely in two. It will demonstrate the total safety of a hardfork block size increase, nullifying years of FUD from this sub, and paving the way for future increases. Hopefully certain Core members will stick to their word and rage quit.
