"you do something purposefully or with purpose. ""on purpose"" is just as bad as ""on accident:"" it is the same colloquial error, but is very common.

by accident is the same as by purpose. 

accidentally would be correct.

via accident. via purpose. both correct, via, on and by are synonymous in this context.

it's just uneducated or slangy to turn those into prepositional phrases unless you're using it for effect:
