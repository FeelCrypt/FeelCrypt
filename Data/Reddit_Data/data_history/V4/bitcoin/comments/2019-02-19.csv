"I believe you, but I also believe that the current QR reader apps are extremely dumb. They are probably not using deep learning algos to localize the position of the QR codes, not using focus changing algorithms to refocus the QR codes on the pictures.
With standard bar codes there was a real competition between the companies that probably isn't happening with QR codes.";1;1;False;xiphy;egs0uhz;Upgrade Man!;arwyl0;https://i.redd.it/5vtaxk3pqbh21.jpg
"It depends on error correction levels, and if any of the corner squares are damaged.

I've successfully scanned a damaged QR code by coloring in the missing parts of the corner squares with a sharpie.  The other damaged areas were recovered by the built-in error correction.

When you scan a QR code with a logo in the middle, your scanner sees the logo as damage and recovers the obscured data using the rest of the code and some math.";5;0;False;skylarmt;egrr8wv;Upgrade Man!;arwyl0;https://i.redd.it/5vtaxk3pqbh21.jpg

"I think we disagree on what ""of concern"" means. The goals of RFID and barcodes can be vastly different. I'd say if cost is ever ""of concern"", a barcode will meet that need. The RFID projects I'm on, cost is low priority. That also deals with tracking, which barcodes can't handle in our environment.";2;0;False;theoopst;egroxp0;Upgrade Man!;arwyl0;https://i.redd.it/5vtaxk3pqbh21.jpg
