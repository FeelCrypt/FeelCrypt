"The idea that a raw max block size increase will magically turn Bitcoin into something like PayPal or Visa is absurd.

Quite the opposite, it would fully encourage even further mining power centralization, giving hijackers like Jihan, Ver & Co even more ammunition in their hostile takeover attempts.

SegWit is the way forward. It is a *safe* block size increase, plus opens the door to so much more scaling strategies, without puting bitcoin in the hands of its enemies.

It would be wonderful if we had more miners.  The current max block size is already too large, and it's led to this attack by unscrupulous miners (Jihan & Co.).  We need better usage of the block size we have now (that SegWit provides).  No dangerous hardfork, no giving in to terrorist demands. 

With the side channels SegWit enables (also described in the original Bitcoin white paper), any block size increase could be completely unnecessary. If not, then there will be PLENTY of time to implement SAFE ways to do it, without the horrendous danger it would bring with it today.";1;0;False;Terminal-Psychosis;difogl8;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

"Based on what evidence?  Zero.  

On the other hand, cryptocurrency experts agree that safe and sane scaling that is SegWit, is the way forward.

IF, by some stretch of the imagination, bigger blocks are needed someday, then we'll have plenty of time to find a SAFE way to implement them.

Doing it now is a road to disaster. It would put bitcoin right into the hands of its enemies (hijacking attempts run by the likes of Jihan, Ver & Co.).

No, There will be no hardfork for raw block size increase with zero protections.   

SegWit comes first, then we see.";1;0;False;Terminal-Psychosis;difoqhw;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

"Many people are anyway, just to support Crypto and Bitcoin.

Even running a full node is a positive, personally (can actually verify transactions locally) as well as growing the network.

Come ONNNNN SegWit! :)";2;0;False;Terminal-Psychosis;difodp2;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper. It's 8 pages long and still the most lucid description of the system that I've ever read.;6dsot4;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
