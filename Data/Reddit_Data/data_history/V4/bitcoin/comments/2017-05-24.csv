"Well I just ignored the contents (but not the sources) of the first link because I saw the rest of the website, but the sources were very informative.

For example ""Portuguese drug policy shows that decriminalization can work, but only alongside improvements in health and social policies."" (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/12/10/portuguese-drug-policy-alex-stevens/) so get to work on that. 

Elsewhere (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/766/Portugal_NR2012_443595.pdf) turns out the use of drugs in schools did, in fact, go up during this period (with an astounding 31.2% increase of drug use by 18 year olds).  So ouch.

One (http://www.release.org.uk/publications/quiet-revolution-drug-decriminalisation-policies-practice-across-globe) was a 404 link.

I'm not arguing that.

> We've wasted billions globally on the drug war.

Not arguing that, either.

I am arguing that.

Up.

> In this particular case...we're seeing decriminalization. Not legalization. So the cartels moving product still own the market. They control the drugs and the flow of product. The portugese government doesn't get tax money from the sales.

I do enjoy seeing cartels get more money.

This is where we disagree. That is the law's ideal state, but not it's actual state.

No one agrees slavery laws were intended to protect society as a whole. No one agrees drug laws are there to protect society as a whole (you might argue their intention is to protect society, but they quite plainly don't work and therefore aren't functional, and the law writers have plainly stated that their racist intentions).

If you disagree with laws, fight them. Future generations depend on you for a just nation.

Stage sit-ins, run away as a slave or harbor slaves. Hide jews and other persecuted individuals. These may seem like extreme circumstances, but they are real, and they aren't very far in my family's past, and millions of people around the world are still living under similar laws.

"> What utility does a gun have except for killing? Zero. None. Zilch. Nada.

That is completely incorrect. Firearms are used for sport and recreation everywhere. Is the primary utility of a firearm to kill? Yes and no. The primary utility of a shotgun is sport and killing fowl. The primary utility of a competition shotgun is shooting clays, for competition. It's not ever used for anything else, it is ""sports equipment"" as you stated. That's what it's designed for, and that's what it's used for. Sorry but you are simply wrong. Firearms have much more purpose than just ""killing"". Shit, even a firearm marketed and designed for home and personal defense isn't for ""killing"", it's purpose is protecting. 

You have a very narrow and skewed view of firearms. It's obvious you never owned or spent any time around them. My point is that if I sell you a .40 S&W handgun what you do with it has no relevance to me. I'm not ""enabling murder"" by selling it to you. I just sold you a handgun, that's it. If I sell you a kitchen knife and you kill someone with it that's on you. I didn't ""enable"" you at all, you made your own decisions. By your logic if I sell you a car and you drive it into a crowd of people I ""enabled"" you. The ""purpose"" of the object has absolutely zero relevance. It's what the person chooses to do with it.

You've got to reinvest it in non-depreciating assets as quickly as circumstantially possible or have a short term use for it.  You don't hide laundered money, and you don't make it dirty again either. You certainly wouldn't fund murder for hire with it.

 That's precisely why I brought up that scenario. Just because you agree with the laws and believe that your justice system is largely fair does not mean that police secure compliance differently. ;2;1;False;Josent;dhy9etj;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

">He had people murdered

Was the statement. In the court of law, there is no conviction for this. This is fact. You can google the case yourself. It's on public record. 

That is the only proof I need offer that his statement is legally false.

Without proof or conviction of ""He had people murdered"", it's a false statement as libel goes.";1;1;False;XSSpants;dhzns42;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
