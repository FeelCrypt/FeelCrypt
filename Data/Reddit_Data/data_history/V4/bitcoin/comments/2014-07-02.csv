"Exactly, and for that risk, transaction fees are lowered and the merchant has no risk for charge backs.  So part of that partnership should be a sharing in some of the savings for the customer.

Bitcoin is awesome but if the consumer lowers the fees for the merchant, and gets all his consumer advocacy taken away, there isn't a real benefit for using them short of wanting to support the protocol or trying to stay anonymous.

Most merchants are offering bitcoin discounts, not doing so is short-term selfishness IMO.";2;1;False;CryptoManbeard;cim68vk;Newegg now accepts Bitcoin.;29jmd6;http://i.imgur.com/nebwLhP.png
Exactly, they should offer a discount to offset this negative, or at least issue the refund in BTC or USD.  I think they are potentially worried about currency price fluctuations and don't want to have to refund a BTC that is worth significantly more later on down the road (ie you pay 1 BTC for a laptop at $600 a BTC and then 2 months later you get a refund for 1 BTC at $900 a BTC).  But I doubt anyone would have an issue with using a USD conversion at the moment the refund is processed.  ie that same refund would only give you .7 BTC when they processed.;1;0;False;CryptoManbeard;cim5dnj;Newegg now accepts Bitcoin.;29jmd6;http://i.imgur.com/nebwLhP.png

"Man.

Just go a head and marry Newegg or something.

Situation A: 

""Here is a product I sell"", says the scammer, ""it is very interesting and you can pay with bitcoin!""

""I'll take three dozens"", said the enthusiastic user, ""They will look good next to my collection of bitcoin paraphernalia!""

""Lol, sucker, I now have your money and you don't have anything. This is the best currency ever"", thought the scammer!

Situation B:

""Here is a product I sell"", says Newegg, ""it is very interesting and you can pay with bitcoin!""

""I'll take three dozens"", said the enthusiastic user, ""They will look good next to my collection of bitcoin paraphernalia!""

A couple days later, the products turn out defective and/or not actually what was bought. ""No refunds, see it's written right there in the fine prints. So long, sucker."", said NewEgg, laughing all the way to the  bank with your money. 

You would make a chargeback but since this is bitcoin, the most safe and secure currency ever, where nobody can steal your coins, you decide that this is actually good for bitcoin and make a reddit post about how it's different because in the end you are screwed out of your hard earned bitcoins just the same.

Meanwhile, the next guy who used fiat, just threatens a chargeback and gets Newegg to act reasonably. Also, apparently, someone stole all the CC numbers at Newegg but he doesn't give a shit because any half decent bank provides one-time use CCs for internet purchases.";0;1;False;redisnotdead;cimley8;Newegg now accepts Bitcoin.;29jmd6;http://i.imgur.com/nebwLhP.png
Yes, I have sent and received bitcoins. You misunderstand the process of the transaction.

suggests there's probably a much better reason you can't argue with me, such as not having a leg to stand on.

It doesn't take five days to settle a credit card transaction. After a 10-second confirmation, the funds transfer is guaranteed to go through, which is why they let you walk right out of the shop after you swipe your card and sign. There is no guarantee of that in the Bitcoin protocol--orphan blocks are a known issue inherent to distributed confirmation.

Chargebacks are possible for up to 90 days, and are consumer-friendly--they give the customer a fighting chance against fraudulent merchants. With Bitcoin, once you've paid, you're fucked.

"What do you think the paperwork from Bitpay looks like?  Just 'you got paid $30,000', here you go'?  No.  Rather, Bitpay produces a transaction history that includes a transaction ID, the amount of Bitcoin taken, the fee imposed, and the amount of Fiat obtained.  

It's the same way with banks and credit cards.  Every credit card transaction is directly deposited into Newegg's merchant account.  Newegg doesn't act as the ACH.  Newegg isn't a bank.  Yet, they accept credit cards just like they accept Bitcoin.

"I upvoted your grandparent for display purposes, even though you are probably not authentic, since the mods already said /u/witcoins would be approved if he posts here.

You are pretty much wrong, because you can't concern yourself about what the other party does with the money they receive. Does Wikipedia accept stocks as donations? With your reasoning, since they likely convert them to USD right away (which is not certain anyway), they don't.

Newegg is likely converting most, if not all of the Bitcoin they receive, into the currency their costs are in. Just like they would do for the EUR I would send them if I used my credit card (assuming I had one). Technically they're not even Euro, it's a debt derivative denominated in Euro converted on the fly into USD debt.

Yet no one in their right mind would mean any of those when they say ""they accept Euro"" or ""they accept credit cards"".

They use a payment processor for both of these things. EUR and BTC are converted on the fly. Except, they have the option to keep some of the BTC. As long as they don't have any costs they can cover with bitcoins, I don't imagine they will be keeping them, except maybe a small amount of profits.

One way that percentage will increase is workers demanding a portion of their salaries in Bitcoin. Of course at that point you will claim that these are maniacal libertarians and it doesn't count.

Another way is some suppliers accepting bitcoins. Some will readily do it, but I don't think the volume would be enough to integrate Bitcoin into the internal money flow.

I don't think anyone ever claimed that these would happen magically overnight.

These things will take years of course. But if you will be backpedaling on technicality, then you will have to raise the stakes. Eat your hat on camera? Just an idea though...

They are accepting Bitcoin.

If you COULD in fact pay in tulips it would be a sign of tulips being popular enough to get a payment processor and for NewEgg to write an article and tweet about it, which they do not.

"Well.  I worked at Discover Card, which is a credit card network.  And how that worked is they (the merchant) would get a terminal from us.  We could then process exchanges of value between one customers account to another.  We would then give the merchant that value in fiat.  So yes, Discover Card accepts their network and pay people who use their network in fiat.  Bitpay accepts bitcoin network payments and pay people who use their ""network"" in fiat.

"I said I'll leave when they start accepting bitcoins. They're not accepting bitcoins; they're accepting ""bitcoins."" In other words, they're still taking USD. This is not news.

I know you idiots think it's the same thing, but it's not. When they actually do accept bitcoins (never gonna happen) then I'll leave.

Edit: Hey guy,

>The problem with /u/witcoins and some others is that they take trolling to a whole new level and integrate hate speech, physical threats of violence, and doxxing into their toolbox 

Please show me where I ever did any of those things. Please link me to those posts. You can't, because that never happened.

Edit 2: I love how this thread is supposedly ""calling me out"" yet my response gets downvoted so no one sees it. Well done, r/bitcoin.

Edit 3: I think the ""paging"" thing you guys are doing doesn't actually work on my account. I have never had (and do not want) Reddit Gold. Reddit is a cesspool, so as you can see on the original witcoins account (before your mods decided to ban me for speaking too much truth), I never participate in Reddit other than to mock you failures.

Edit 4: Going back to edit 1: Hey mod, show me where I supposedly did those things. If you're going to defame someone on the internet, you should at least know what the fuck you're talking about. The worst I've done to anyone here is hurt their feelings/bruised their egos. And, of course, I've pointed out that criminal bitcoin ""celebrities"" should be in prison. Erik got away with a slap on the wrist (and is stupid enough to be *mad* about the punishment he did get) but Charlie's days are numbered. Kinda hope Roger pokes his head up in the US somewhere just so I can watch law enforcement go to work.

Edit 5: (Why so many edits? Reddit's dumb karma system limiting the number of comments I can make)

Since the vast majority of you seem to be in this thread simply to circlejerk and not actually read what I have to say, (and the ones who do read it are downvoting it so the rest of you *can't* read it) this is my last response. Don't accuse me of running off; Reddit says this post has been here for over five hours. If you've paid attention to anything I've ever said here, you'll know that I have stated *many* times that accepting Bitpay isn't accepting bitcoins. This is not some weird new stance I've just come up with. Go read through my posting history. Your weird definition of ""accepting bitcoins"" isn't even technically correct.";-374;15;False;4qjuu;cim5h1u;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg

"Well, at least one achievement has been unlocked. Newegg is accepting Bitcoins. That much is true. They currently convert it into USD, just as they do with EUR.

However, they don't internally use Bitcoin as a currency. I agree that it would be a far greater achievement if they begin to do so, but I don't expect it for at least a couple of years, if ever.

Adhering to that logic, this is true. Newegg has an agreement with those payment providers in which they will receive Fiat for those transactions. Newegg does not accept credit, those providers do. Newegg solely accepts Fiat. ;1;0;False;until0;cim4zgm;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg
"His point is the company immediately trades the Bitcoin for fiat meaning they truly do not value the currency, only the Fiat behind it. If Newegg actually retained the Bitcoin they received to use for future investment in the company, that would be the ideal situation. It shows that companies see value in the currency beyond its current capability to be converted directly to Fiat. His point actually makes a lot of sense. 

It would be like if I accepted cash, but instantly converted it to Gold because I did not trust the US economy. It's nothing more than a barter.

I disagree. It would be like saying they accept Rubles, but only after the Rubles are sent to a bank and converted into dollars. If you could somehow send Rubles directly to them through the internet, they would not take the payment for the same reason if you were to send them bitcoins. They don't accept either form of currency as payment. If you could do the same things with dollars as you could with bitcoins, every online retailer in the US would be setting up direct pay the very next day because they accept dollars. ;1;0;False;akajefe;cimnspb;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg
