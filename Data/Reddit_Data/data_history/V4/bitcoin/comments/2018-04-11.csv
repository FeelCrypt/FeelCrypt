"If people stopped spending bitcoin, the less demand it will have for people to buy bitcoins. The less demand, the less value. It basically just turns into those special minted collector's coins.

Currently, bitcoin is mostly valued in speculation - that is value is based on the speculation that it *might* be more valuable later *if* it becomes more widely adopted. Unfortunately that adoption won't happen if people don't use it as a currency.

Basically, if the majority of bitcoin adopters only hodl, the less bitcoin has in value. Hodling only becomes profitable if done in the minority while the majority spends and uses it as a currency increasing adoption of it as a currency and deflating it's value.

This is especially true as the rise in price starts to plateau as mass adoption happens. People will start to find the present value of other goods higher than the future value of the relative bitcoin. As far as spend/buy back the philosophy is the same regardless. Either you spend bitcoin to pay for goods and the merchants convert to local currencies or you sell bitcoin for local currency and spend. This is true regardless of how much bitcoin you own. Merchants already have methods of payment that work well for the majority currencies that people hold. They're not going to convert or add a new method of payment to accept bitcoin just because a few people ask for it.

"**Gresham's law**

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

">why does the price go up?

Well I'll start by saying it doesn't go up because people love trading it away for goods. Maybe in the future, but we aren't there yet.

The price goes up because more and more people prefer to store their value in Bitcoin as opposed to fiat or other investment vehicles. You gonna hold Bitcoin, capped at 21m supply, or are you gonna hold the ever inflating fiat?

>why do people want to use it?

To store their value and protect their wealth in a post 2008 crisis world. People are waking up to how central banking has been robbing them of their wealth for decades.

Also because it is pseudo anonymous and permission-less. The best applications for Bitcoin purchases and transactions are ones in which fiat does not work. Darkweb, internet gambling, moving value from one website or exchange to another, etc..

It's not because ""cheap and fast!"", that's for damn sure. It's not cheaper. It's not faster. It certainly could be one day though! 

The world had no shortage of cheap and fast payment mechanisms back before Bitcoin was invented. If you think Satoshi created Bitcoin to compete with 2% merchant-side credit card fees.... well you missed what makes bitcoin revolutionary my friend.

Want proof that Bitcoin's value has almost no relation to the number of merchants accepting it and the number of people using it to buy legal goods and services? Well merchant adoption and legal goods purchasing with bitcoin peaked in 2014-2015. What more proof do you need?

The former ensures that the latter never happens. Small, slow inflationary pressure is what keeps fiat going forever because it incentivizes circulation over hoarding. One penny in 1800 equates to somewhere around $2.35 today according to inflation calculators -- but nobody is panicking about that huge change because it happened over the course of a couple hundred years. The same will be true a couple of hundred years from now when someone does the same comparison. The real danger to fiat is the collapse of the backing entity's power (which absolutely could happen during the next couple hundred years), not inflation.

"> spending increases the market size thus increases the price

Speculation at specialized locations is a better outreach mechanism than spending.  People can already find others to exchange with, so market size is currently limited by speculative belief, not merchant activity.  

This leaves store of value as the strongest basis for money.  Bitcoin has a lot more adoption and speculative smoothing technology (derivative trading) to integrate before it is a nice and boring store of value.

In order to not get stuck in a referential loop based purely on scarcity (like gemstones), it's very helpful to any wannabe money when everyday merchant activity is possible.  This requires commodity-level fungibility that allows quick verification.  It's great if something like the lightning network gives Bitcoin a better medium of exchange story than dollar bills, Paypal, and credit cards.  But this can develop over time.  

It is not necessary to take any unnatural exchange loss to use bitcoins in places where you could otherwise spend fiat that is burning a hole in your pocket.  Let the technology get better and more widespread, and let more people get sick of how bad fiat money is.

Your instinct to spread the word is not misplaced, but merchants are not as important as you think.  It is sufficient to hodl, until they offer you a percentage discount to let go of your bitcoins.

But it did! They used their bitcoin to buy a lambo and now have no money left. Pretty darn good lesson from bitcoin there if you ask me, if they haven't learned from that by now then nothing will ever teach them.

>99.99% of wealth creation is done using the legacy fiat money system, and bitcoin is mainly used by speculators trying to make money off each other without generating anything of value.

And only 0.1% are actually good at it using the legacy fiat money system, and that's because it teaches people to spend their money as quickly as possible and punishes saving. Bitcoin is a brand new asset class that is going to be the money of the future, a kind of money that is actually a decent store of value and that encourages saving instead of punishing it. Money isn't meant to generate value itself, it's a way to keep track of things we own and exchange with each other. And Bitcoin does this in a way that's revolutionary and that makes it very valuable.

>If you're just using bitcoin for saving and not using it as a currency, how is it different from just saving your money in other deflationary assets?

I'm currently using bitcoin for saving and fiat for spending because that's the cheapest and easiest way for me. That doesn't mean this is how it will be forever, I expect this to change when bitcoin has matured more.

It's a chicken and egg problem. However it's a solvable chicken and egg problem depending on the currency.

For fiat money, there is no value outside of people accepting it, most importantly, the government accepting it and letting taxes be paid in it. 

For gold, the value came from the scarcity, which led people to accept it as a medium of exchange.

Money Supply in bitcoin is constant, so you posit that velocity must increase for total spending to increase.  However, with bitcoin, this will hold if price goes down as total aggregate value goes up.  Therefore, the quantity theory of money works fine for Bitcoin if you don't mind declining prices as aggregate value increases. I make the following assumptions:

* Both the bitcoin world and major governments want T to increase.  

* Governments have the additional constraint that prices should remain stable.  Therefore they can only really twiddle with either M or V to increase T.  

* Bitcoin cannot twiddle with M, therefore only V and P are available to it.

You are also misunderstanding what it means to use money.  A person does not use money when they buy something; that is when they STOP using money.

"The hodlers will be satisfied when the price stabilizes. When it appears there is no longer any gain to be had. At that point, it no longer makes sense to hodl, anymore than it makes sense to stash FIAT into your mattress. In theory, that could be any price from $1 to $1,000,000 a coin. 

The bottom floor on bitcoin at that point would be caused by ensuring there are enough coins in circulation to handle the transactions needed. Today's there's about $1T in US FIAT to support our $18T economy. So by that measure, the market cap for bitcoin would simply need to be about 1/10 to 1/20 the total volume of bitcoin transactions in a day. 

On the other end, there is another interesting limit. A coin can only be split to 8 decimal places. A coin value over $1,000,000 would mean you can no longer represent a penny. So, while that's probably OK, there is going to be a theoretical limit. For example, we can't just say, the smallest transaction allowed is $10.

"The problem, in my opinion, is viewing crypto as currency. While this may have been the inteded goal for Bitcoin - as Satoshi outlined in the white paper - this is certainly not the only use case for most crypto. It has evolved beyond ONE utility and instead encompasses many use cases accross multiple unassociated industries.

So in essence, crypto can be stock, money, and a decentralized database all at once. Seeing it as only having ONE use case is a very miopic way to look at things. However, if you believe that it only has ONE use case - to be used as money - then, it's perfectly valid to tell people to spend it. But even then, fiat money is only worth spending because it devalues over time. Crypto, if we assume limited supply, is bound to rise in prices due to contrained supply. This is a big reason people spend fiat money in stock; to protect against inflation. And the reason a lot of people have also adapted the same mentality torward crypto; again, to protect against inflation.";2;2;False;kidbid;dx74ijs;Hodl vs spedn;8bh2yc;https://i.redd.it/oh7hu2ks7ar01.jpg

"The heart of this debate is that crypto-austrians believe that the value of Bitcoin is in it's financial sovereignty, aka it's ability to act as a store of value, protected by from the state. These are usually security maximalists, often called small blockers or decentralists.

Crypto-keynesians believe that the value of Bitcoin is derived from it's ability to fluidly transact, e.g as a medium of exchange. This group is usually referred to as big blockers, and put the ability to transact cheaply as higher priority than maximal security.

The meme has a valid point. You can be a crypto-austrian, spend, and then rebuy. It presents increased tax complications, extra time/labor, both of which can be rationalized if you are an avid Bitcoin supporter.

Jimmy Song [wrote a great article on the subject](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c), and I think at the least we can walk away better educated and try to understand that both sides have the valid perspectives based on Modern economic theories.

I personally think that the entire debate is a false equivalency because Bitcoin with lightning network will be able to serve as both a store of value and a fluid medium of exchange, making those who argue for the crypto-keynesians side seem narrow on vision.

"There is nothing hypocritical in the hodl mentality, people who promote spending for spending's sake do not understand where value comes from. The progression is novelty -> store of value -> means of exchange -> unit of account.

Value is a function of desirability and scarcity. Ignoring the more advanced things that are possible, bitcoin is desirable because it can be securely stored and moved without 3rd party permission, and because it is scarce. 

Spending bitcoin does not increase its value. Spending for spending's sake may increase the liquidity of bitcoin - but generally it just increases the supply of people selling bitcoin in relation to the people buying which drives the price down. 

Bitcoin becomes more valuable when people produce things that others want and need and then are only willing to exchange those things for bitcoin. In that case any increased spending of bitcoin is driven by the creation of new value that pulls people into the bitcoin economy.

It makes very little sense to promote bitcoin by encouraging people to spend.

">This is the problem with a currency that rises in value year after year

Only if there are no alternatives.  No one says ""The problem with real estate is that it rises in value year over year"" or ""The problem with stocks is that it rises in value year over year"" or ""The problem with X commodity that is not fiat rises in value year over year"".  We have a pretty solid medium of exchange in the USD and the Euro and the Yen and other major currencies.  What we NEEDED was an alternative to these things.

Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and a store of value.

If the value of a commodity drops over time \(say, by inflating supply\), that commodity is not a good store of value. USD is not a good store of value.  It has been designed to only be a medium of exchange.  The inflation rate is *designed* to increase its velocity so as to bolster its value as a medium of exchange, at the expense of its utility as a store of value.  This is designed to get people out of the USD and into other commodities, which increases the velocity and stimulates growth. 

Bitcoin is not so compelled.  It is not a tool to increase the productivity of the country who issues it.  It is literally designed to be a store of value that is also easy to exchange.  That's the precise reason the protocol caps the supply.";7;2;False;manWhoHasNoName;dx72rf1;Hodl vs spedn;8bh2yc;https://i.redd.it/oh7hu2ks7ar01.jpg

"Ok so show me one example of a person who can prove that they have consistently over a long period of time made market beating returns from day trading?  You all seem so sure these people are out there, lets see them.  Yes if you have been day trading bitcoin through the run up, you have probably been able to make a living, but a rising tide lifts all ships.  I have a feeeling you guys defending day traders are young and don't realize that since the 80's with every assets bubble there have been ""day traders"" that seemed to make great profits, but then every time it all falls apart that generation of day traders go by the wayside, and its a few years before a new generation is lured by this concept. 

Also your example about scale is ridiculous.  With a market cap of $117B there should be plenty of liquidity for a small to medium size fund to apply any and all strategies that work for a Joe Schmoe.  Further when the entirety of the financial markets is considered, even small positions spread across many securities could solve the liquidity problem you refer too.  

So once again I ask, show any level of capital investment where a person has made market beating returns over a greater than 10 year period of time by day trading.

"This is an impossible argument because you can't really define TA in any meaningful way. How do you research something that is so broad and undefined? 

Did they historically test every indicator? Did they historically test order flow analysis? Every bar pattern, chart pattern, and moon cycle?

"Thats now how it works, alot of day trading strategies dont scale. Every seller needs a buyer and vice versa. For instance if you want to sell 10 bitcoin immediately, you probably can at or near current market value. However if you want to sell 1,000 bitcoin immediately, you will drive down the price of bitcoin in the process and errode or eliminate your profits from that trade.

Thats why day traders are usually joe schmoes not working with huge amounts of capital.

"Just going off GDAX order book. If you were to market sell 1000 bitcoin right now, it would plunge the price by $160... whereas if you market sold 10 bitcoin, it would drop the price by $6. Ergo, the smaller position would have a much higher average selling price than the larger position. Now lets say you are trying to scalp a $100 move. You probably walk away with about $994 if you were trading 10 bitcoin. Whereas if you were trading 1000 bitcoin the same trade would be a $60,000 loss. (EDIT: BTW this is assuming similar slippage on the buy, and that the average price of the trade is the median price, plus not taking into account trading fees etc. The point isnt to give an exact example but simply to demonstrate how larger position sizes errode profits, marketcap be damned.)

And day traders dont just make money on the upside, they also make money on the downside by shorting. Its arguably much easier to make money during a bear market as panic selling is alot quicker and more decisive.

And day traders typically manage a single position at a time. So if a hedge fund wanted to day trade 100 different securities to solve the scaling problem, they would have to hire 100 different day traders. And why would the day traders work for them in the first place? You would have to pay them less than they are currently making in order to turn a profit.

Im mainly an investor, but I use knowledge of trading to better manage my positions. The difference is I undertstand markets and trading, whereas you obviously dont. And yes there are plenty of successful day traders, just like there are plenty of successful doctors.. but I cant produce 10 years of a professional day traders tax return any easier than I can produce 10 years of a professional doctor's tax return. You obviously know this, and are making impossible requests because you realize you lack the knowledge to rebut the things im saying, yet for whatever reason despite this lack of knowledge, you are still confident in your opinion.";1;1;False;BeardPatrol;dx79ews;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto.

"You're absolutely right that one of the main obstacles to testing TA is that its entirely subjective which shapes appear in your bar chart tea leaves. There has been research into trying to convert indicators into more concrete and systematic definitions, and applying them to large amounts of historical data. They even have used neural networks and tried teaching it into learning its best to recognize the patterns, and then had it try to apply it to live data.

I think the main problem people have with TA is that it's just so unscientific. It's like having someone come up to you and tell you about how they've had so much success at blackjack at the casino. You can find hundreds of people who swear by blackjack strategy being profitable long term, when we just know it isn't mathematically, without an outside variable adjusting the odds.

It comes off as a cheap get rich quick scheme peddled by con artists to people who don't want to actually learn to understand investing, but just want an easy trick to get rich. Not unlike the one quick trick dentists don't want you to know to get white teeth from this sweet home remedy. How do you know it doesn't work? Have scientists tried everything possible on their teeth?
