"**Quantitative easing**

Quantitative easing (QE), alternatively known as Large Scale Assets Purchases, is a monetary policy in which a central bank creates new electronic money in order to buy government bonds or other financial assets to stimulate the economy (i.e., to increase private-sector spending and return inflation to its target). An unconventional form of monetary policy, it is usually used when standard monetary policy has become ineffective at combating a falling money supply. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply. This differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.

"> I've never used Linux before.

That's okay!  What's important is that you're interested in learning to.  I'd say [start with this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkDd6jClqEE)  It's not mine, but its description is pretty on point for installing Ubuntu Linux on a Virtual Machine back in 2013.  The age of the video shouldn't be a huge factor, just always go for the latest version of software.  

Doing this in a VM is important because you don't want to trash (potentially) the only PC you have.  In a Virtual Machine you can goof as many times as you have to.

Once you're able to get a VM running, do it a second time to make sure.  Hell, do it a third time because then you'll need to get a few new (and advanced) things under your belt.  

Specifically ask yourself:

* [how do I update Ubuntu?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/301484/how-do-i-update-ubuntu-manually)
* [how do I use a terminal emulator?](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)
* [how do I SSH to my new Linux machine from Windows?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/136671/how-to-login-into-a-ubuntu-machine-from-windows)
* [what the hell even is SSH?](https://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Linux)
* [how do I do some basic BASH programming?](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)
* [what the hell is a repository?](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu)

Once you're messing around in the terminal a bit, doing some bash scripting and using vim to write some files, consider using something a little more aggressive like [Archlinux.](https://www.archlinux.org/)  Arch is a barebones bleeding edge Linux distribution, but by no means is it necessary to get a node running.

After you've done all of that stuff, check out [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) and /r/buildapc and study the different parts of a PC.  Once you know what a motherboard is and what its socket types are and how to match those to RAM and CPU, you should be able to choose a budget or start looking on your local Craigslist etc. for deals.  Ask yourself ""how much money could I spend on a PC right now without going into debt.

">It's entirely the point. The only reason for Bitcoin to exist is for censorship resistance. It's about monetary sovereignty, not cheap payments. 

An artificial constraint on transactional capacity is a form of *self censorship*. You might be convinced that we need *some* artificial, ""consensus-rule"" type limit on transactional capacity (because you don't think that a natural limit exists -- or would be sufficient), but obviously at some point such a limit becomes counterproductive. Obviously if the block size limit were 1 kb today instead of 1 MB, allowing for perhaps one non-coinbase transaction per block, Bitcoin would be completely unusable.  And obviously if we kept the base block size limit at 1 MB indefinitely while attempting to reach truly global levels of adoption, the system would break down long before we got there. (At 3 tps, it would take the world's 7 billion people about **75 years**(!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.  Good luck opening a Lightning channel in that scenario!) 

>The people who've promoted Bitcoin as a competitor to PayPal or Visa never understood why Bitcoin was valuable in the first place. 

You have half a point there. Bitcoin's most important use cases today aren't particularly fee sensitive (and certainly don't include general retail payments). But that doesn't change the fact that *all* use cases are harmed by the introduction of unnecessary friction. If you're someone who's buying 50 dollars’ worth of Bitcoin as a long-term speculative investment, paying a two-dollar fee to transfer the funds to your own wallet is an immediate 4% ""tax"" on your investment (and if fees hit $5/tx, that becomes a 10% tax). That's not trivial. Now some might scoff and say that 50 bucks isn't an ""investment""-sized purchase, but for many people it absolutely is. And of course there are other people who might be doing 50-dollar weekly buys which they want to immediately transfer to their own wallet (because isn't avoiding counterparty risk sort of the whole point?). And obviously any use cases *other* than long-term speculation are going to be harmed even more by high fees as those use cases will almost certainly involve smaller and more frequent transactions. 

There’s also harm to Bitcoin’s “virality” as it becomes increasingly impractical for people to casually share a few bits with friends or acquaintances (something I used to really enjoy doing), and for new users to play around with and gain confidence in the technology by sending actual transactions. To me, setting up different kinds of wallets--brain, paper, phone, desktop--and actually using the Bitcoin network and verifying for yourself that this crazy and (to new users especially, intimidating) technology actually works is an essential ""rite of passage"" in becoming a ""Bitcoiner."" And we've allowed that to become prohibitively expensive at a time when we should be seeking to grow aggressively. That is madness. 

>If you want cheap payments, wait for 2nd layer solutions such as lightning.

So-called ""second layer solutions"" will certainly have their place, but they're obviously not a cure-all (see the 7 billion people example above).  Furthermore, when you move transactions to a second layer you have, *by definition*, added another layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the base layer is artificially constrained. (The smaller the base, the more precarious the structures built on top of it. For example, the LN suffers from what I call the ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.) 

>at all costs

No, of course not. The real question is one of the *tradeoffs* involved. At what point (if any) do the obvious benefits of allowing for increased on-chain capacity begin to be outweighed by the costs of doing so? That's the limit the network should presumably target. And that's going to be a shifting target as conditions change, e.g., as technology improves.

">  The only reason for Bitcoin to exist is for censorship resistance. It's about monetary sovereignty, not cheap payments.

This is what *you* think Bitcoin is all about , but it's not what the *creator* thinks. I don't see that anywhere in [the white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), the document that Satoshi used to introduce the world to Bitcoin. I do see this, which is the actual reason Bitcoin exists:

> Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.

> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any

Correct, but certainly not the whole story. By design, the block reward subsidises transactions for many years, with this subsidy scaling in terms of value handled under the assumption of constant user and transaction growth. Capping the volume of transactions forces the fees the rise to maintain equilibrium, and certainly was not the intention from conception, as anyone with base intellectual honesty can attest to.

This is a solid use case.

"Coffee costs a dollar, plus tax is $1.25.

Cash:

I hand them a $5. Now I have stupid coins to deal with. If I brought the wrong currency, the vendor won't accept it. If it turns out the coffee is amazing and I want to buy a giant bag of the beans, unless I thought to bring enough currency with me, I'm out of luck. The more currency I bring with me, the greater the loss if I lose my wallet, get mugged, etc ..

Digital: 

My VISA is linked to my phone's NFC. I always carry my phone. I tap to pay for the exact amount of the coffee, I get a 2% bonus, and my transaction is logged so I can easily see now much I spend on coffee a year, if I care. If I lose my phone, I don't lose my money.

"I think you're probably trolling but... The credit card is the far superior transaction method for purchases. 
1) You have an effectively unlimited purchasing power in something the size of a business card. $1 or $10 or $10 - it's all the same.
2) If you lose it or if its stolen - you don't lose any money. 
3) Since everyone takes CC's and CC's charge fees to give their customers no liability and things like cashback and points if you pay with cash you are paying for those boons but not receiving them (unless the place gives a cash discount). 
4) It's more difficult to track purchases and expenditures with cash as compared to a CC that has a digital log - much easier for budgeting and expense management. 
5) No change. Coins suck. 
6) Cash is fabric/paper/weak plastics/etc. Credit Cards are more durable. You can take them in the ocean or to a concert and don't have to worry about them being destroyed/gross/etc. 
7) You never run out. You don't need to ""hit the ATM"". Or ""break a bill"". Or any physical management of your money. You don't need a money clip or a wallet. Just a place to stick your card. And since you probably have your ID on you, which conveniently is the same size, just stick it with that.
