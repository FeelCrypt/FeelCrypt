I think its a good comparison IMO especially considering that javascript wasn't really meant to do all the things that it does today. First use cases were very rudimentary then some very smart and creative people just took it and ran and over time it grew into all these crazy things that make the web much better. :) I don't think anyone in '95 ever really thought something like Node.js would be a success. If you go back in time they would scoff at the idea.;1;0;False;uhhhhhhhhwat;dj593qr;Newbies to Bitcoin right now;6huazt;http://i.imgur.com/fx33rLx.gifv

It's always puzzling to me that this is one of the questions I get most when I introduce people to cryptos. I guess they're thinking of it like stocks. When they hear the current price per coin, they seem to think it's become too expensive to buy some.;460;24;False;Mortos3;dj6728y;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg
Correct. Also, why can't buy a fraction of a stock? ;25;12;False;dbvbtm;dj67wpw;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg

It's like that animation of the silhouette of a girl with a pony-tail spinning around, a shift in perspective around that decimal point. In my opinion this is the essence of deflationary currency, and why bitcoin has the potential to be a much better reflection of global value (at least- when the speculative storms of entry have calmed down).;26;1;False;;dj67lch;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg
