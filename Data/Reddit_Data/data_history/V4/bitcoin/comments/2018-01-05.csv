"probably not, bitcoin is meant as a medium of exchange. it was never meant as an investment tool. while its good to have short term assets in a deflationary currency instead of an inflationary currency, its terrible to have your assets in both long term. 

buying bitcoin is just like buying gold, over time there is some mined, at one point in the future all of it will be mined and there will be none left. this scarcity produces ridiculous volatility because people think that they will miss out on the huge returns of owning something that cant be produced anymore. this leads to huge spikes in price and then crashes when people become scared when the price drops. you might think you'll become super rich holding .025 bitcoin, but that's only because you are focusing on the short term picture and not the long term picture of bitcoin. bitcoin doesn't have much of a price history because its inception was in 2010. but the rules are the exact same as gold (with the exception of storage and transaction costs). gold appreciates slowly over time. it has spikes, but the spikes always crash. gold from 1985 to 2005 only appreciated 3% annually. that's  conservative pricing. gold bought during the 1980 gold boom and sold at 2005 actually depreciated around 1% annually. if you didn't put your money anywhere you would get 2-3% deflation. so gold was still technically better than nowhere.

the reason why warren buffet is a billionaire is because he makes money on compound interest. if you have one bitcoin it appreciates in price over time. if you need food, you have to sell bitcoin in order to feed yourself. if you own part of a business with operating revenue, you can use its distributed dividends to feed yourself as your share value appreciates over time. if there is some money left over, you can then reinvest the money back into the business and your share of the pie increases. I think that bitcoin should be the medium of exchange that these businesses use to transact business for libertarian reasons. but to think that one day bitcoin will replace these businesses is absolutely fucking retarded. to think that bitcoin is worth more than these businesses is absolutely fucking retarded. and if you think that a medium of exchange is a better investment than the people transacting the medium of exchange, then essentially you are saying there is no point to do business because the bitcoin they are using to do business is worth more than the business itself, and the people exchanging bitcoin are stupid because not doing anything at all and holding the bitcoin will produce more to the economy than actually doing something; and that would make you absolutely fucking retarded.

Stage one of Segwit did little to improve Bitcoin as a currency, and stage two was flat-out cancelled. Now they're talking about the Lightning network, yet that has seen multiple delays too.

"First of all, I trust you understand the difference between intrinsic value and extrinsic value (most people don't). I argue crypto has both, securities in a stock have both, USD has only extrinsic value, and Gold has mostly extrinsic value except the relatively small intrinsic value of its industrial use as a malleable conductor. 

His statement misses the point. He's trying to compare crypto to a different type of asset, namely a security in a stock, and criticizes it for not being backed by stake in something of legal ownership. It's intellectually dishonest, because it's a false analogy, and begs the obvious question about the unique and intrinsically valuable technologies behind crypto. Using the blockchain and conceptually similiar technologies for immutable, uncensored, trustless exchange of property and information has immense intrinsic value.

Specific coins and tokens have a price that directly represents its extrinsic value, which is found through market equilibrium at least in part based on people's intuition of its intrinsic value (of the technology, the team, community, brand, legal status, etc).

Not true. The bitcoin blockchain produces the means to store unalterable records on a public ledger at a cheap cost. To use the blockchain for smart contracts and and asset tracking all the world's business will need to pay for it in Bitcoin.

You are investing in a thing, the value might go up it might go down but after 100 years you still only have a thing.

CocaCola's brand is valuable in the context of soft-drinks and the related markets it has slowly created over the years.

"> Microsoft or Facebook have never seen their stock rise 1500% in 
> a single year either

Bitcoin was always publicly available.  Facebook was not always publicly traded,  so  we don't have charts for their initial business growth.   Things don't KEEP growing in size at massive rates like 1500%  after they reach a certain level of maturity growth -  after the business is mature in 10 years or so, growth tends to even out,  BUT it happens many companies grow a lot at the early stages of a new business and technology:   Facebook started out the size of a spec  and wounded up one of the largest technology companies of the US,  and that involved some SERIOUSLY massive growth rates  much larger cumulative growth over a short time than BitCoin has seen.

Generally a startup like Facebook will remain PRIVATELY held  until the vast majority of exponential or parabolic growth the business has ever seen has already happened and passed ----  It would be foolish for investors to start selling some of their shares at such an early stage,  And instead then, AFTER the initial growth phase: the early investors expect to sell out to enjoy the massive profit of their 100 to 1000%+  annual growth over the company's early years, 
 and a common exit strategy to get the early investors and let the venture capitalists or other funders take their profit out is to go public with an IPO, so that the investors can sell some of their stock to an unsuspecting public.

By the time of the IPO the vast majority of growth a startup will get is done with,  and you can expect less than 100% annual growth.

At some point Facebook went from 1 user to  1 billion   in 13 years,  And there's  NO POSSIBLE WAY that happened without massive growth rates like 10000%  during some years.

You could alternatively say on day 1 of their IPO many companies rose from less than $1 a share to their opening price which would be 100000%+ growth in a day.

All of this short sightedness and unrealistic expectations is a recipe for disaster when the hype wears off, and it will, with time it always does.

Limited supply means nothing, especially since it's artificially limited - if a large enough proportion of Bitcoin miners agreed, the limit could be changed or removed entirely. 

The only reason people can even claim that it's a store of value is because a consistent influx of new speculators has kept pumping the price up. If, or rather when, the number of new people entering drops off and demand decreases, the price of Bitcoin will fall. And then it will be a destroyer of value, not a store of value.

Bitcoin, like Uber will disrupt the way things used to be done. The blockchain and smart contracts will save people millions in accounting and legal fees, crypto provides banking to the unbankable and will be a safe storage for savings in nations where the government can change the currency at a moment's notice - don't believe me, ask anyone in Eritrea who lost their life savings to a Dictator's need to take over reserves.;1;0;False;Bitcoincadre;ds7nepr;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/
