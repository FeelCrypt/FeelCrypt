"I think That was a different situation entirely.  The bitcoin hardfork was to fix a critical bug in the code

In my opinion The DAO was a hardfork to reverse a hack because the people in charge of the DAO were friends with people in the ethereum foundation and people in the ethereum foundation were heavily involved in the DAO as well.  Also the hardfork was done because the foundation didn’t want a huge amount of ETH under control of a bad actor in the event ethereum moved to Proof of Stake 

The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn’t want the fork to happen (as evidenced by ETH Classic existing) ";-4;2;False;CalvinsStuffedTiger;dtj0td4;Bitcoin.. The King;7u9zbd;https://i.redd.it/4tl0oustqed01.jpg

BCH is just as bad as a hack solution. The blockchain size is already prohibitively too large for people to house their own wallets, further causing more people to rely on centralized services to handle their wallets, reducing the security and reliability of the network. The reliance on centralized wallet providers also make it no better than PayPal or banking institutions, which undermines the original purpose of Bitcoin. BCH makes that even worse.

Fluctuations are bad, sure. But so is running at 100% non-stop for months on end with potentially dying fans. I recently bought a secondhand card from a miner that was identical to a card I currently have and game on regularly. If I use both on stock clock speeds in the same machine, the card that I use is flawless, giving me really clear, artifact free benchmarks. The miner card has artifacts all over the place and I ended up having to under clock it, taking a massive hit to performance and decreasing my framerates significantly. I've also seen some miner cards that don't have as many issues, but the point is, it's not healthy for the card to be at 100% all the time;1;0;False;LtWilhelm;dtje12u;Bitcoin..

Absolutely correct, it’s thermal variation from startup to operating and that cycle of cold-hot-cold is what plays havoc with components and PCB layer construction. If a GPU card or Mobo is at nearly constant temperature, if it doesn’t fail in first 6 months it’s likely to last many many years. Of course you need quality components on board. If you buy cheap shit you get cheap shit results.  (capacitors being critical ones that can cause issues);1;0;False;JCuckaroo;dtiyrms;Bitcoin.. The King;7u9zbd;https://i.redd.it/4tl0oustqed01.jpg

Why do gamers think this? My 4.5 year old GPU I use in my rig has handled a hell of a lot more abuse just in the last 6 months than any of mine or my friends mining cards and my gaming GPU is running just fine. Its been used damn near every day since it was bought, especially when I was job hunting for 6 months and would regularly play for 6+ hours a day with tons of temperature fluctuation. My mining cards however sit at under 65°c  with hardly any fluctuation. The only thing that might wear out in the next decade on a GPU are the fans.

"Flooding the market with shitty used GPUs would drive down the prices of new GPUs as well.  Assuming all the miners close up shop all that demand for new GPUs goes away and that drops the price.  Plus at some point as the price of old GPUs drop people decide to switch from new to old even if they're ""shitty"".  Render farms would happily take miners old cards--they're going to be buying in bulk anyway.  At the point where used GPUs were half the cost of new a lot of people would switch from new to used and figure they could just buy another one if the first one failed.

"> They won't understand why they have to make large down payments far ahead of time before they can spend. They won't understand what channels they need to open up and why they have to pay into it as well.

They already need to make down payments ahead of time (buying bitcoins) before they can spend. By the time LN is ready for mass use (which it isn't now), the user won't be exposed to channels. Their initial buy will establish a payment channel with whoever sold them their coins, and if their software can't find a route for later purchases then it'll create a new channel automatically. 

> It doesn't just work transparently behind the scenes, and requires a completely different and more cumbersome user experience for the masses to easily adapt to.

How do you think it's different from [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_pTB8gCuvQ)? I understand that copying and pasting a long address is a pain in the neck, but that will eventually be streamlined with [URIs like bitcoin: links have now](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki), [payment protocols](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki), etc.

People already are familiar with debit cards, and the idea of having to have money in an account to spend it, so it's not much of a stretch.  Eventually, wallets will get to the point where using LN is essentially transparent, heck some will probably even create one behind-the-scenes without you even knowing it, and *only* provide LN services, but in a way the user doesn't have to deal with it, and can use it like a normal account.

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously presume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

">The demand for Bitcoin was from speculators who thought they could get rich quick from it. 

And what would initiate such a thing? It had been in a bear market for two years. It had been hanging around $200 for ages after hitting $1200. It did not look like a get rich scheme mid-2015 to mid-2016.

Only a sudden decrease in supply would initiate a new bull market.

And anyway - there's nothing wrong if people think it will make them rich. It fosters adoption. No one is buying Bitcoin or any crypto to buy stuff on the web.

>Bitcoin has the slowest transaction fees and times, is not anonymous, and can only be used as a coin, unlike other platforms.

New tech like lightning, MimbleWimble make these arguments redundant. And Bitcoin is still the most decentralized and secure Blockchain - which is most important.

The fact that you think crypto is here to make money shows exactly how flawed you are here. It has and always will be a tool to buy things.

"Untrue.  Mostly at least.

Lightning isn't centralized itself, as it's a mesh network where you can open a channel to X person, and if they have an open channel to Y, and Y has a channel to Z, you can transact with Z through the chain.  So there is no 'service' that a single entity can shut down, freeze, block, etc.  There also isn't any 'central' services that are technically in control of your funds in any way.

That being said, I do agree there is some worry and possibility LN could cause centralization, as that may be what is most convenient to the users, and LN *allows* centralization to occur a bit easier.

Not 1$, not a few cents, but absolute 0, so until someone you or ""they"" (whoever they happens to be in this case) don't like, is holding a significant portion of their finances in ethereum it's unlikely to get crashed by an exploit or a hack. -edit- also, a lot of people seem to think that hacking means stealing, they aren't synonymous. Sometimes an institution getting hacked is someone coming to their servers and bombing them or setting them on fire or whatever destructive method serves the purpose those people have in mind. ""Hacking"" does not mean what the common person thinks it means. It is commonly associated now with digital theft, but just because someone took something doesn't mean they have it, or ever had access to it. (1). 2, the word originates from things being easier to ""hack together"" or ""hack apart"" with shitty code that sniffs and steals data, or simply redirects and loses it, than it is to build and run an organized program/website/database which both does what its function is supposed to be, and is an active deterrent to theft/intrusion/packet sniffing/exploits as well. The word hacking originates from engineering, (especially military) and was used as a reference to improvising solutions. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. ""hacking"" could literally be throwing the hard drive out of a window if you are instructed to ""hack"" a competitors PC's to cause them difficulty at the ""right time."" Programmers adapted the saying because it fit better than anything else to their task, which was not unlike engineering in that it's purely a function of logic. Because Ethereum is turing complete code, it can be exploited in some way or another. The possibilities are infinite and they are narrowed down the more is understood about the code (which, I'm sure it's open source lol.) Which translates to: It is only a matter of time until someone figures out a work around for stealing a significant portion of it, or simply destroying a significant portion of it in a very small time frame, but since it will likely destroy the value of the coin as well, this would only be worth doing to fuck someone over - it would not be profitable unless that somehow profited you.";-12;3;False;RiverXer;dtitemh;Bitcoin..

"> The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn’t want the fork to happen

There was a near complete hashrate consensus prior to and at the time of the fork, and none of the exchanges were opposed to the fork. 

The movement to keep ""Ethereum Classic"" alive as a separate coin only really became a thing **after** the fork had occurred, the return of hashrate and it's addition to exchanges happened well after the fork, hence why multiple exchanges were caught flat-footed and were drained of their ETC (that was supposed to be meaningless/worthless)

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

"You really do never know what you are going to get.  I am something of a bitcoin maximalist (have been since 2009) but am open to other currencies.  As a result of a collaboration with one alt (BCN, which is the coin from which Monero was forked) which at the time, a few years ago, was 63rd or 65th on the crypto market cap list (it wasn't worth much at that time, relative to some other decentralized cryptosystems), I was able to get an idea integrated into BCN that at the time simply would not have been possible to have been integrated into bitcoin: small, but voluntary microdonations (as an option in the BCN graphical wallet, either from mining or just from transactions).  see http://abis.io for some details.  That was back in late 2015. (Today BCN is 28th on coinmarketcap, it usually has been ranging now somewhere between 20th and 25th, but the past couple days have been rough for all cryptos, though they will bounce back.)

In bitcoin, there was a bit of a waiting game for segwit to activate (now it's activated) and for lightning to become available (now there are hundreds of lightning nodes, though it is still in testing) both of which are preconditions before http://abis.io can be developed in a bitcoin wallet.  (See also a colleague's project (u/ktorn) - http://subsatoshi.org/ -- which will likely find eventual further development and application as lightning development proceeds.)  I think the voluntary microdonation concept envisioned originally and implemented in BCN can soon be developed in the form of a bitcoin GUI wallet that has that same feature.  

Interestingly, BCN and bitcoin have some of the same features now (bitcoin picked up some stuff that was originally present in BCN).  See:

1) https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html

and

"Not sure I agree with you there.

I got hacked off with Windows the other week and installed Ubuntu. Everything worked straight away. Spotify, Steam (despite running a 7850 rather than an nvidia card), Silverlight in Firefox, the free office seems to have leapt forward.. I found open source versions of all the server/storage/disk utilities I need for work. The only reason I've switched back to Windows (I have two SSDs, one Ubuntu one W8.1 and an early UEFI BIOS that allows this) is because the framerate in CS:GO is marginally better..

">What's the Pineapple fund? I love Pineapples and would just help out based on that.

According to the link provided by OP:

The organization was started in December by an anonymous donor who goes by the nickname “Pine” and claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund aims to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin, and has already given $20 million worth of the currency to 13 organizations, including million-dollar donations to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights watchdog.

(These donations can be verified thanks to Bitcoin’s digital ledger system, which records every transaction in a public database.)

"> given how the segwit adoption process went I wouldn't hold my breath for it to happen in a timely fashion when quantum computers become an imminent threat.

Segwit is optional. Not everyone has a stimul to generate a Segwit address and transfer his funds there - which costs time to do and money in fees to transfer.  
Now if you tell me that my wallet can easily get hacked unless I transfer my funds I am sure people would do it ASAP.  
There's a difference. Not sure why you don't see it or you just decide to pretend that you don't see it.

There is no strategy that lets you hit the highs and lows with accuracy. In theory, you can make millions of dollars by trading every little fluctuation in any asset. The only reason people have any luck with that strategy with Bitcoin is because of the dramatic volatility and because people just believe Bitcoin will go up forever, and have happened to be right.;1;0;False;Darkeyescry22;dtip18h;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

"The point is, if you feel like you made a mistake and don't have the stomach for the volatility, you have a much better chance at selling your 4 btc and leaving the market at a small profit or at a much smaller loss than either selling your 1 btc at a $9,500 loss or hoping the market eventually gets all the way back to $20,000

Of course this entire strategy assumes you can afford to play in the first place. If OP spent 100% of his money to buy in at the top, he should have read the disclaimer. Everybody wants to get rich and no one is taking the time to follow the rules of investing. If OP asked himself prior to buying, ""Does a $19k btc have value?"" and the answer was Yes, then he shouldn't have a problem using DCA because he finds the current price less than the value he assigned when he bought.

Let me ask, what do you think bitcoin offers that consumers would rather have over other coins? It’s not faster, it’s not less expensive to use, it’s not anonymous, and the technology backing it is already being outpaced by others. The literally most basic equation in economics is marginal benefits > marginal cost. I’d recon that there’s not many people out there eager to jump back on a speculative market where they stand to lose so much with diminishing returns after a “correction” (bubble pop here) like this one. If bitcoin loses the public fame it will die, we are seeing both. Now let me also ask you, what does bitcoin have on its horizon that would reverse what we’re seeing?

This is something people often don’t understand: we will see many people getting rich on crypto currencies sure, but the majority of that already happened. Bitcoin isn’t for hackers and criminals and super ahead of the lot nerds anymore. Once it became mainstream the lambo dreams are pretty much over for most of not all. You can still make good gains, much more than with conventional investment (with a lot more risk) but the “I made $1 mil from $100” times are pretty much over now that big guys trade with hundreds of millions and pretty much can decide the price. ;9;2;False;bvcxy;dtivclm;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

Just when you think a crypto is going to do something, it does the exact opposite. I had a huge stake in Cardano before it exploded and completely missed that train. I beat myself up every day about it, but at least I took a hefty profit when I did cash out. Find a technology that you personally admire and stick with it. For me, it’s Vechain. They are making huge moves behind the scene and securing massive contracts from the financial sector to supply chain logistics and even higher education. Rebrand in a few weeks. Highest potential IMO. Just like Cardano and Neo, it is much better than Ethereum and could surpass it this year. Actual real use cases is where I’m putting my money.

"> Why wouldn't it?

Quantum computers. Shor's algorithm will make it possible for people with quantum computers to derived private keys given a public key. This would allow then to steal funds from any address that has previously sent funds. Eventually they might even be able to front run transactions, brute forcing signatures as soon as transactions are submitted to the mempool and submitting a different one with a different recipient. At that point the blockchain will be pretty much unusable.

There are quantum safe signing algorithms, but they all have major drawbacks. They either have huge keys, keys you can only use once, or are orders of magnitude more computationally intensive than current options. All of those are detrimental to use in blockchains. Plus you'd have to get bitcoin to adopt one or more of them, and given how the segwit adoption process went I wouldn't hold my breath for it to happen in a timely fashion when quantum computers become an imminent threat.

No. View bitcoin as the trailblazer, the big thing that comes first and sets a precedent of some kind. But trailblazers never last, that is their great sacrifice. Bitcoin at this point is not very useful. Both as something to store value, because its not viewed as currency and is instead just speculated upon, and also because transactions and withdrawals are way too slow and the fees are too high.

"I think both you and /u/Rafek_Krajzan need to actually read the article you are linking.

My point is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I point to the tulip craze as one example of an asset bubble where the values crashed and they never again rose to the highs they had achieved.

From the article:

>That’s not to say that everything about the story is wrong; **merchants really did engage in a frantic tulip trade, and they paid incredibly high prices for some bulbs. And when a number of buyers announced they couldn’t pay the high price previously agreed upon, the market did fall apart and cause a small crisis—but only because it undermined social expectations.**

If you still want to ignore the historical precedent of the price of rare tulip bulbs never attaining the heights they had reached during the tulip bubble, look at the scores of other examples from history.

One such example... the dotcom bubble of the late 90's. At that time, many dotcom stocks like pets.com were valued way beyond what their earnings would support. People kept pumping money into dotcom stocks because ""this time it's different!""

When it all crashed and burned, stocks like pets.com never came close to rising to the values they once commanded. True, there were some companies like Amazon that emerged and represented real value, but the vast majority of dotcom stocks were totally speculative and just because they had reached a certain price in the past was NO GUARANTEE that they would ever again reach that price point.

I am merely pointing out the fallacy in the belief that bitcoin (or ANY asset for that matter) will reach a certain nominal value based on prior performance. Look again at the post I responded to. The poster was saying bitcoin will go back up in value because it was once a higher value. There is no basis for this conclusion except faith and an erroneous belief that past performance guarantees future results.";1;0;False;CensorshipMustGo;dtjj8tx;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

"Lightning does use onion routing yes, but onion routing is not exclusive to lightning (a naive example, just use bitcoin over tor to conceal your identity. More advanced, build it into the system). There are also other solutions to privacy on chain such as zksnarks (but still emerging tech).

The take away is this. Lightning network is complex. Hugely complex with many known known concerns and probably more unknown unknowns. 1 billion users, topping up their payment channels, evenly distributed over a month once a month, could get away with something like 32meg blocks and all associated risks with keys, being online, watchers, insurance structures to ensure you can afford to pay the fee to counteract a defraud etc. So you need bigger blocks anyway for this to be remotely viable, and even then there are huge security concerns and it will still be limited to those of us wealthy enough to settle on-chain once a month or so.

"That is a very good question.  No, it's not just based on popularity.

The genesis of bitcoin is really unique because of the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Cryptocurrency was basically just a science experiment for a few years.  There was some really truly organic growth for years without any obvious effort from the founders to get rich on the project.

It will be nearly impossible to duplicate a similar genesis story with a new project.  All projects naturally start as centralized.  Even Bitcoin was just a few people at first.  The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has over $10 Billion in bitcoin that he never moved means he is likely dead, or perhaps the group that is Satoshi made those coins intentionally unretrievable forever for the good of the project.

The idea behind bitcoin was to create money that could be moved peer to peer that no government or large organization (banks, etc.) could stop.  If a project has a handful of people that could be jailed which would effectively stop the project or destroy its value, it doesn't meet that objective.  I really think Bitcoin is the only project that passes that test right now.

The arduous process to implement the SegWit upgrade really demonstrates how difficult it is to make protocol level changes with bitcoin.  It is very easy to make major changes on more centralized projects.  The difficulty to change things is actually a feature and not a bug with respect to what we are talking about.

It is not impossible that another project could become as decentralized as bitcoin, but it is very unlikely.  I don't think it would happen simply because of lower fees or faster transaction propagation.  If you think about it, those things can almost always be improved by whatever coin is the newest, but it makes no sense that the newest coins would be the best for long term value storage.  You need one long term stateless ledger to price things.  Analog, that is gold, with little real competition for thousands of years despite other metals with more rarity, etc.  Time itself makes it stronger in it's role.  First is a really big advantage for this specific application.";5;1;False;xxDan_Evansxx;dtibcls;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

It’s stupid to think most people in this world are going to live with that kind of risk. Hence there will be watchers, and watchers to watch the watchers. And watchers to watch those watchers. And the watcher who’s watching your channel for you will need to hold your keys so they can sign against any potential theft. So there you have it.

I totally agree. Because of that , something that costs $10k today that will *surely* cost $100k soon enough to beat the rest of the market **without a potential risk proportional to potential returns** cannot exist either. BTC can go to $100k, or a million, or more, sure. But comes with a proportional risk. It is not a mostly risk free way to get 10x gains when you weigh the risks by comparing it to other similar options in the market as a whole. Or else, it would be the definition of free lunch.

For instance you can bet that US dollar will lose 1% value before gaining 1% value and use 10x leverage. It is not more riskier than hodling $10k bitcoins hoping to sell them for $100k in a timeframe beating the average market.

Just my take, i think this is due to a huge build up of FUD and weak handed new crypto fanatics going up against Wall Street for profit.  The market grew substantially and both the Blockchain and exchanges couldn't keep up which helped increase uncertainty (Bcash, high fees, wall street shorts, bans, frauds etc)  and decreased demand.  Wall Street profited by pushing prices even lower but their interest will fade with lower gains and governments will stop really caring again when public interest falls. The price will stabilize shortly and probably stay there for a while. I believe this because with the recent attention we also gained more Bitcoin enthusiasts buying for the tech and innovation, regardless of the price. Just like in the past, t'll keep the market going and with good news  (Lightning, more ETFs, major merchants etc) we'll see the price start to pump.  Hopefully Bitcoin and exchanges will be ready when interest grows again and with the amazing work being done on the Lightning Network it might be much sooner then later. Just Hodl.;2;2;False;scottfc;dti6jko;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

"you can buy again to decrease your average... (16000 + 10000 + 10000) / 3 = 12000

"A few weeks ago Korea regulated and added rules that spooked the market. Now they have banned anonymous accounts and banned people from creating accounts. In a week or 2 new accounts can be created.

For example this is Korbit s email. (I have a level 0 account)

Registration Process for New KRW Deposit Method
The new bank verification and KRW deposit method has begun. If you had tried to previously register on 01/30/2018 and went through the EDD process on the Shinhan site without success or you had issues with the deposit number issuance on the Korbit site, please note that these issues for the most part have now been resolved. 

In compliance with the regulations, all previously issued KRW deposit accounts before 01/30/2018 will be terminated. You will need to register a Shinhan Bank account to be allowed to deposit KRW onto Korbit.

When you register a Shinhan Bank account under your legal name, a new KRW deposit number will be issued.

To ensure a consistent implementation of the new method, we are inviting you in two cohorts to complete the registration process: 

Cohort 1
Registration Period: 10:00 KST on 01/30/2018 to 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018
Eligibility: Hold an existing KRW deposit account as of 00:00 KST on 01/30/2018

Cohort 2
Registration Period: From 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018 onwards
Eligibility: All members

Even if you are in Cohort 1, you may still register after 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018. However, we would strongly urge you to complete the process before then.

The prospect of registering as a new trader is undergoing negotiations. We will inform you once we reach a consensus.

You will be able to withdraw KRW to the registered bank withdrawal account after a temporary interruption that ends at 10:00 KST on 01/30/2018. You do not need to register a new verified Shinhan Bank account to withdraw KRW.

Please review the following to expedite the registration process:

Hold or create a Shinhan Bank account under your legal name.
Enable mobile / Internet banking at Shinhan Bank.
Ensure that the mobile phone number is the same at Korbit and Shinhan.
Those who have already been using a Shinhan Bank account must also follow the procedure to register an account. 

Please note that only Korean nationals may be issued a new KRW deposit number.

Thank you.

"Well.. Hopefully you didn't dump a huge sum into it at that point, if you have investment $$ left over for market fluctuations like what we're seeing now then you can still buy the dips to keep your average on par with the market... Prices are so much lower now that you can decrease your average heavily without having to buy up so much more so that's the upside

e.g. buy 3x times the amount now you bought in at 18500 and that would be: (18500 + 9910 + 9910 + 9910) / 4 = 12057.5 your cost per coin -> I'd be shitting myself a lot less if I could sell a coin for this amount at a profit vs 18,500";1;0;False;vitriolic_amalgamati;dtiuve1;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW
