This is assuming the situation doesn't change, which it 100% will change.  Hopefully newer addons to bitcoin will ease the burden.  However, even if the worst case scenario happens and bitcoin drops dramatically, that means that fewer people will be using it and the fees will go down, allowing you to move your (now worth less than before) coins.

Not true. In this very moment right now - we all have an unfathomable variety of different choices in front of us. 

So many in fact, that many of us make similar choices seemingly ad finitum, but over time we all learn and grow in our own way - especially in terms of decision making.

That incalculable number of choices are decided by us, countless of times per minute. Many, the vast majority in fact, pass us by subconsciously while a small percentage are within our average conscious awareness, if only for a moment. 

It is in beginning with what you are consciously aware of as a decision, and infusing it with complete integrity and great wisdom. 

This can be any decision, such as eating some fresh broccoli instead of M&Ms, or applying yourself fully at work; rather than giving only a minimum effort, be as completely present with your activity while you are there. Or at least, as close as you can manage!

"A transaction is generally the movement of a coin or fraction of a coin from one location to another.

This movement is recorded on the chain in blocks of 1MB in total size.

Roughly every 10 minutes a block is added to the chain with those transactions in it.

3500ish per 10 mins.

The TX (transactions) have fees (small portions) attached and the miners choose which TXs get into the next block. They choose the ones with higher fees.

Right now if no one makes a new TX for the next 4 days then all the TXs will be completed.

It used to take under an hour then a few hours became the norm then 1/2 a day. Now fees keep rising to be able to have a decent chance to get a fast TX and the waits go up and up and up.

If you have $30 in bitcoin, you may never be able to move it due to the fees. If the fees become closer to $100 then you won't be able to spend or move that either.

"But they're problems fundamental to the technology - e.g., proof of work combined with inability to shard the network - so it's not like you can just throw a team of developers at it and say ""fix this!"", the way you would for a typical application. 

Every single solution that's been proposed so far is basically a workaround to the fundamental limits of the Bitcoin blockchain, not a solution to those limits. Basically, the developers all accept that those limits aren't going to be lifted any time soon, and that workarounds are the only option.

Plus, making significant changes to Bitcoin itself is hugely problematic because it's so heavily used and has no formal governance. It's similar to the reason that most of the US last mile broadband infrastructure is so slow compared to many other countries - because it was one of the first movers, it's hard to change now.

Another thing that's been predicted for years is that Bitcoin won't be the final cryptocurrency. The best solution to these problems will probably take the form of a different blockchain, but the one that's so obviously better than Bitcoin and doesn't have its own set of fundamental limitations hasn't been invented yet.

"Well, you could start with [this list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy#Arguments_in_opposition_to_increasing_the_blocksize). Or get a sense of the broader issues from [General Block Size Increase Theory](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability_FAQ#General_Block_Size_Increase_Theory). 

Part of the problem is that the effects on the network can't be fully predicted, such as the effect on the number of full nodes, etc. Addressing the issue essentially requires experimenting on the Bitcoin community, and as I've already alluded to, some people are naturally conservative about that.

These kinds of factors are what I was getting at when I wrote that because the available solutions don't address the fundamental limitations, it ""makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix."" It's not just a binary question of increasing the block size or not - it's a question of which direction to go in a much larger possibility space.

If you step back and look at it dispassionately, it could make a lot of sense to force a more comprehensive solution now than postpone scaling problems to when adoption is even more widespread and major changes will be even more difficult.

In situations like this, it's pretty common for uncoordinated groups of people to wait until the problems are so bad that a contentious fix is better than the status quo even for the people who were originally against it. 

That happens, as I've pointed out, because of a lack of true solutions to the problem, the fact that changes need to be made to a large, actively used network, and the lack of formal governance.

"Sorry you felt it was condescending, I was just stating my qualifications. I have a degree in economics. 

Once again economics is not an exact science. I can't tell you with certainty where bitcoin is going to peak and when the bubble is going to burst because that's not something I can predict. It's almost totally dependent on the whales and since I can't read their minds I don't know when they will sell. 

What I can tell you with certainty is that the value of bitcoin is artificially inflated by sudden and intense demand, and the value of bitcoin is ONLY due to this high demand. Yeah there's some new tech rolled into it but that's largely irrelevant since 99% of people are in it for money. So basically, bitcoin is in a bubble and due to crash hard and we know this because this exact scenario has played out in different markets several times before I don't know what else you want from me. If you want hard data go do a little research on Black Tuesday.

As for you asking me to give you specific price points and time frames, hang on lemme just roll my crystal ball. You're either A. Asking me for things you know I can't come up with, no economist could come up with what you're asking with anything other than their best guess, or B. Totally ignorant of what you're actually asking for. 

Forgive me but *you* actually don't seem to be adding anything here other than vaguely passive aggressive skepticism. Do you not think bitcoin is in a bubble or are you just arguing for arguments sake?
";1;0;False;fucknazimodzzz;drm3b07;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501
"> Anyone can say bitcoin is a bubble. That's not difficult and it seems like the common sense explanation, at least to me, but you saying that means basically nothing to me. Give actual predictions like an estimated peak it will reach at what time, and back it up with data and logic.

That's not how this works. Because bubbles don't follow financial fundamentals, it's psychology more than anything. An economist of financier can't tell you how long the euphoria is going to last, only that the current valuation is way higher than it should be and that we've seen these kinds of things before. 

Have you seen The Big Short? You know how the main character knew real estate was in a bubble and mortgage backed securities were fucked, but the price kept going up longer than he anticipated? That's how bubbles go. They usually last longer than the detractors think but pop sooner than the believers think. One thing I can say is that when buyers are leveraged, that's an indication that it'll pop sooner rather than later. I don't think people are taking out loans for bitcoin so that should let it last a bit longer at least. 

> Another detail that you can go into is an estimated price it will stabilize at. Obviously cryptocurrencies have some value because of their potential applications once everyone isn't trying to jump on them to make cash, so if you can predict where it will end up with some data, that would also be very useful and interesting to hear.

Normally valuations of assets work by calculating something called ""intrinsic value."" Basically, it's the sum of the discounted future cash flows. Discounted means you account for the time value of money. In other words, $100 today is better than $100 in 5 years, because A) inflation, and B) you can invest that $100 today. 

However, bitcoin obviously has no future cash flows. If you simply hold it, you get no money from it because it doesn't pay dividends or interest. So looking it that way is futile. Others want to look at it like a currency, obviously, since that was its original intention. But it's fucking useless as a currency. Its value is extremely volatile, which is horrible for a currency. Why would I pay someone 1 bitcoin today when I can pay them .5 bitcoin in a week for the same thing? Why would I use bitcoin when the number of places that accept is extremely small? Why would I use bitcoin when transactions take half a day to process and have fees upwards of $20? It's absolutely ludicrous. 

So what's left? Using it as a store of value? Again, way too volatile, and the fact that it has no intrinsic value. Gold, which I also would not invest in, at least has tangible uses as jewelry or in certain technologies. Gold and other precious metals, by the way, has also experienced bubbles. They too are ultimately bound by the value of their uses. Bitcoin has no independent uses. So when it eventually corrects, it'll correct *hard.* If you want to store value, buy a fucking t-bond. They pay a set rate of interest and you are guaranteed to get your principal back at the end.

"> maybe they feel like it's because the tradeoffs are too large

Right. It's not a solution, it's just making different tradeoffs for a short term benefit. I'm not arguing either side, just pointing out that the fundamental limits aren't addressed by this kind of fix. That also makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix.

> At least be honest about the situation.

Try not to impose your prejudices on me.

> The original plan of increasing block size is not a work-around. 

It absolutely is. As you pointed out yourself, it's a short term fix and involves tradeoffs.

> You may think it's a bad idea and that's fine, but you're wrong about the fundamentals of Bitcoin.

I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I'm saying it doesn't in any way address the fundamental limits created by a proof of work algorithm running on an unshardable network. It's playing with parameters, trading off properties against each other. 

> My understanding is that Blockstream is making the decisions now. Is that what you mean by governance?

I said no *formal* governance. To the extent that Blockstream has control, it's de facto, and besides there's no accountability to stakeholders which one would typically expect with more formal governance.

That's another fundamental limitation on Bitcoin - the governance model is a bad ancap joke, and the community has been discovering that first hand for a while now.

"Background is in accounting and I understand BTC fairly well. Assuming he does some very illegal things, they can't prove shit honestly EDIT: If he is meticulous and flawless. The burden of proof is on them to prove he has it/had it during the divorce. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I LISTED HERE AS IT'S VERY VERY ILLEGAL AND COULD RESULT IN TIME IN JAIL** . But in theory here's how people could launder money via BTC (and why the government really sees BTC as a threat in money launders/drug trade). Also, future money laundering techniques will make future Breaking Bad a very very boring show, because there is no need for a carwash or chicken. 


1. Buy some pumped/overvalued altcoin on an exchange tied to your actual personal information.

2. Scrub the alt coin (basically makes it untraceable)

3. Move the scrubbed altcoin to another exchange with fake personal info. Sell the altcoin at a similar BTC cost. Rebuy a more valuable coin (like BTC/ETH/LTC/Monero) with the now untraceable fund and put it in a wallet (meaning, you're out very little - albeit susceptible to a huge crash when you're between cryptos).  We'll call this ""hidden BTC"". 

4. Wait for alt-coin to crash

5. Buy a shitload of crashed altcoin post-crash.

6. Move the same number of the altcoin back to exchange with your personal info.

7. Sell alt-coin at a huge loss and put the low proceeds back into bank. You now have your ""loss"" and your ""hidden BTC"". Tell wife you lost a shitload of money on crypto to ensure she files for divorce. 

8. If asked about it by lawyer, say you were investing in crypto and due to the divorce you divested as you'd be incurring more expenses with a single income. 

On the books, it looks like you bought an altcoin on an exchange, moved it out of your wallet, moved the same number of alt coins back to your wallet, and divested at a huge capital loss. In actuality, you only held the altcoin for a brief period of time and sold it right after. 

The next problem is that you now have a bunch of BTC you need to legitimize.

1. Post-divorce, buy a few mining rigs and set up an LLC. 

2. Use said mining rigs to mine whatever the fuck ICOs you want.

3. Wait until a coin that originated AFTER the divorce moons. It might not be the coin you mined, but that doesn't matter.

4. Calculate a reasonable number of coins you COULD have mined with the mining power you had. 

5. Use your ""hidden BTC"" to buy some alt coins and put it into a wallet. Scrub and transfer to another wallet. Ideally, do it in multiple transactions so you aren't as susceptible to a flash crash. 

6. Deposit alt coin onto an exchange and sell (an exchange outside of the US' jurisdiction would make it a shitload easier). Claim this as LLC profit from your 100% legit mining operation. Pay your fucking taxes. Make sure there's no way to prove you mined XYZ coin instead of PROFIT coin. 


7. Don't be stupid. Live to your prior living standards for years after. If you must flaunt your wealth, wait until you have a justification to do-so (ie a job promotion). Tell all your workers about your LLC. Establish a history before you suddenly become rich.

8. Don't mention what you did to a single fucking soul. Whether it be your drinking buddies, family, or reddit. Everyone has a price. Someone could tip off the wife for a small percentage of her legal ruling. Not only would you risk losing the money, but now you also committed felonious money laundering. 

EDIT: Thought I'd add, I've never tried doing this before because I'm not involved in criminal activity (else I wouldn't have posted on my main account or even on an alt account). If someone has further insight as to why this wouldn't work, feel free to chime in. I'm basing my information solely on my experience with the crypto market + my knowledge of how US money laundering cases. I'm moreso sharing this theory to educate people on the very real reason governments/banks fear crypto. 

EDIT2: Also thought I'd do this for fun

LIST OF CRIMINAL YOU PROBABLY WOULD COMMIT in addition to more: Tax evasion **multiple times**, even if you do pay taxes on the final product (because you didn't claim gains/losses on the exchange of alt-coins). Failure to disclose assets (to both the IRS and to the courts during the divorce). Perjury (at minimum, to the divorce lawyer). Conspiracy. And of course, money laundering. Potential identity theft laws in the foreign country which you use the exchange. Not to mention, the not criminal civil laws.

"ETH is probably the most stable, recognized, and accepted other than BTC (LTC would probably have the same problems as BTC if it was as widely used). I personally don't imagine ETH will go down much if at all and could still grow a good amount, but mostly I like it because it can be used like digital currency should. 

If you're not just looking for a straight up currency replacement and want to invest in something with good technology and growth potential, XRB, XMY, and VTC are all coins I've chosen on a basis of the technology and dev teams supporting them. Yes, disclaimer, I'm holding small amounts of these coins, by all means do your own research too. So far though I've had success with choosing coins based on technology rather than fads and what's currently popular. However, I'm more of a longer term investor and I rarely day trade. If you're to flip coins and day trade often then you'll want to just follow the trends rather than pick coins on their own merits and potential future.

XRB is similar to iota, no mining, no fees, literally instant transactions and this should continue to be instant even under massive load. This is a coin gaining a lot of attention and isn't even on any major exchange yet. I'm expecting some big growth in early 2018. 

XMY is a blockchain using five separate hashing algorithms for increased blockchain security, decentralisation, and should be something that can be mined by anyone. They've also successfully used some kind of mining-voting consensus to fork one of the five algorithms to a new one without any issues so it should be able to do so again in the future if necessary. Currently 4 of the algorithms are mined by asics and one by CPU (yescrpyt). They used to have a GPU algorithm or two and will probably vote out the least essential asic algo and have another one good for GPU mining again in the future. Their mantra is essentially to have everyone able to mine forever. This multi chain also keeps transactions fast and fees low. It's been around since 2014 with solid support and has finally started to be noticed and gone up in value considerably in the past week. 

VTC is basically just anti asic. They've forked in the past when an asic was going to be able to mine an they'd do it again if necessary. This will most likely always be a GPU coin. I'm not sure if technology wise what being anti asic does other than decentralisation, but if the above two coins have better technology behind them, the devs working on this coin are fantastic and the market has been receptive to and treated VTC well. It's been stagnant lately, but had gone from about $0.70 to $9 a month or two ago. It's one of those coins that might end up being one of the few to go up and break the $100 mark. I believe it will be getting coinbase or other direct USD markets soon and will also be getting lighting network swaps with LTC. In my opinion if it gets coinbase and USD markets as well as lighting swaps, it'll instantly become a better LTC. 

Again, I am invested in these three coins, so understand that while I'm explaining why I believe in these coins and why I'm invested in them, of course I have all the incentives in the world to tell other people to invest in these coins too so if you're interested, I'd recommend looking at the coins on market cap and the checking out their respective sub-Reddits first.";6;0;False;Tyr808;drlvo1n;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"It's not a dumb question. I'm somewhat of an outsider myself. There's no good answer to that question right now. It really depends. So, BCH and BTC are based on the same technology. I don't mean blockchain in general. I mean that BCH is a copy of BTC. When someone copies the codebase of a cryptocurrency (or any software which is open source) and makes modifications and changes the name, it's called a fork. What really determines what makes one cryptocurrency better than another is up to the individual user and their conception of it. BTC, BCH and every other cryptocurrency have different features. Some of them are more anonymous (Monero). Some of them use different core technology (IOTA). The BCH supporters contend that their cryptocurrency has faster transactions and lower fees and that that is what makes it better. They justify their claim to betterness by referencing Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper that originally describes Bitcoin and started this entire field (so far as I understand the history here). BTC supporters contend, I believe, that BTC has had to move away from the whitepapers for reasons dealing with the technical requirements changing as the project was implemented and the purpose changing as it has been deployed into the real world. BCH supporters are thinking digital currency, the sort you can use if you go to the gas station or to get a slice of pizza, and thus BTC is not suitable for that when the transaction fees are high (higher than the cost of the item you'd be purchasing) and the confirmation times are way too long (due to backlog in the mempool). BTC supporters are interested in implementing solutions to those problems (segwit, lightning network) but also seem to have recognize that the purpose of BTC may have changed from digital cash you use to buy illegal things on silk road to another form of value storage (like gold). There is also an argument for each side about what features of a cryptocurrency end up driving centralization, which can lead to market manipulation for the benefit of the very few. 

My perspective as an outsider is that this shouldn't be a tug of war. I understand why it is. People have a financial interest in draining value to and from different coins and taking market share in the public eye. My perspective is that each serves a different purpose and should be used in tandem, the exact same way things work in our financial atmosphere offline. It isn't cash or gold. You can have both and you **should** have both (liquidity and a slow growth asset). 

Through that lens, it makes all of the complaining I typically see on r/btc seem really, really absurd. I don't care about a whitepaper that was written before this tech was implemented. I care about seeing a fully functional ecosystem of digital financial vehicles emerge and take root and supplant our current fiat currencies.

"> Is there a way to tell if those 284k TX were people trading the currency on an exchange? 

(Edit:) Most exchanges are centralized, i.e. trades happen off the blockchain. So actual trades don't account for those transactions.

However, a lot of the transactions are likely to be people depositing and withdrawing money from exchanges because of the boom in trading activity. There's no evidence of Bitcoin adoption as a currency increasing dramatically recently - if anything, it's been falling off due to some of the problems.

> If/when these TX go through, would they have any effect on the current price on exchanges if so? 

Because most exchange trades happen off the blockchain, the only effect that Bitcoin transaction speed has on the BTC price is indirect.

If people are having trouble getting their money on and off exchanges, that's going to have an effect on prices. Interestingly, when the Bitfinex exchange recently was having trouble with deposits and withdrawals, its Bitcoin price ended up getting over $1000 higher than some other exchanges, but came back down again once the problems were (somewhat) mitigated.

> Are these funds locked up until the transactions go through? 

In theory, it's possible to ""cancel"" unconfirmed transactions, by reissuing the transaction with a higher fee (to make it more likely to be picked up by miners) and sending the money back to yourself. In practice, there can be challenges with this. Wallet software often doesn't support it, you may not control the transaction (if your money is on an exchange), etc.

> Could someone have bought BTC at a lower price, but due to a delayed TX it goes through at the higher price?

(Edit:) The trade itself is unaffected because (most) exchanges are centralized and not on the blockchain. There's no notion of ""price"" on the blockchain - 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC.

"I think it's pretty easy to argue that scarcity is already a property of Bitcoin. There's an upper limit of 21 million Bitcoins, and some 4 million Bitcoins are estimated to be lost by early adopters (when Bitcoin was worth pennies). People like to mention there are 33 million millionaires and only 21 million Bitcoins, but really there are only likely to ever be ~16 million active Bitcoins.

I see what you're saying though, if there were a huge sell off it would put a lot more coins into circulation which makes it less scarce. I think the big argument against this is, as more institutional money gets involved in cryptocurrencies, you're likely to see it swoop in to buy the dips and sit on that extra supply.

Bitcoin has a long history of crashing. That's why the traditional price meme is a [Bitcoin in a roller coaster](https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+rollercoaster&tbm=isch).

This is why the development team sees block size increases as the last resort and opted to change how the transactions work (SegWit) and started to build second layer systems on top of the network (LN).

Some people said ""fuck that"", and the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, with BCH simply doing the bigger blocks as an immediate fix, to make it a viable digital currency *today*.

The problem Bitcoin runs into is that you are dealing with something that now has a rather large financial value. And when it comes to money, people become very conservative and protective, and thus change is very slow and hard to implement. In addition, a majority of clients on the network need to support the change simultaneously or else you end up with a huge mess of conflicts. And with a giant mess of conflicts, the entire network's capability of processing transactions could grind to a halt. Bitcoin's solution to this is consensus, which often requires a supermajority of clients to be capable of supporting a version.

"So, I am a swing trader with a few years of experience under my belt. I by no means do it as a fulltime job, and I by no means like crypto, but should you have any holdings in cryptocurrencies, the following information is extremely important.

The past few weeks showed the setup of a possible head and shoulders pattern. It seems crypto is in the right trough. What happens next really depends on how it behaves over the next couple days.

An educated guess is its running through a head and shoulders pattern since we already have established the following set points.

- left shoulder around December 7th 16,500 realm

- left dip, 13500 realm around December 10th

- head, 19500 realm around December 17th.

And it looks like we are establishing a neckline at around 12,000 right now. Which suggests a falling neckline. This is Bad. If you say this is good you are an idiot. If it is a head and shoulders pattern this is in, it will rebound to the 16000 realm to complete the right shoulder before it falls off a cliff to god knows where.

This bubble looks all set to pop, possibly in the next week or so. If I had any holdings, I would be watching the price very closely for signs that confirm this pattern.

Recommended course of action if you hold crypto for some stupidly retarded reason: watch it over the next day or so, see if it sinks past 12000. If it does, *sell immediately to protect capital*. If it starts to rebound, target your sell point at around 15,000 to 16,000 as that should be where the right shoulder will peak. If you miss that you are fucked because bitcoin will fall off a cliff and the entire crypto market will crash. Optimistic guess that lower bounds of crash would be to low thousands high hundreds, since wall street is starting to poke around with it. But it could crash to 0 and die in a fire.

So, all of that is Assuming of course you could pull you money out quick enough, like any other security that exists ever. But crypto, being a retarded combination of volatile and not very liquid at all, probably won't let you get out with any sense of urgency, which could mean you miss the boat and lose biggly. So, with that fundamental taken into account.

 **Sell, sell it all and run for your life. Don't look back, leave. Get the fuck out. She's going down captain! You will not go to space today.**
-

Hopefully that's memey enough for the densest of crypto heads to understand. 

If your lucky enough to pull out in time, and still wish to invest, I encourage you to look into investing into green industries, robotics, and municipal bonds. The skills you all are learning still translate to other securities, and you stand to make money, as long as you don't make the same mistake of getting cocky and putting all of your eggs into a rocket powered basket without thinking about buying a parachute. And last bits of parting advice: when trading, the worst thing you can think is that 'this time its different' it never is. Don't let emotion make the decisions for you, base your decisions on the fundamentals and the technicals and not *hype trains*

Good luck, and I hope you get out in time.

new poster...I have been following this BTC run from the sidelines...I have been a hedge fund analyst trading stocks and options (more volatile than the craziest day in bitcoin) for 9 years (started in Jan 08 before the crash) so only thinking about it from that framework..I am curious why folks do not talk about bitcoin in terms of market cap. I am also curious how many folks have participated in parabolic trades. It seems pretty obvious to me that a 14k move that has trumped years of marketcap growth in less than 2 mos needs to be consolidated. I would think 8K seems like a screaming buy but also totally reasonable expectation over the next few months but plan to leg in at hopefully 13k and more heavily at 11k but the goal would be to load up at 8k. Almost all stock breakouts occur after periods of sustained consolidation so 20k 17k 14k and the daily freakouts all feels like noise until you go through this consolidation phase and you do not see sustained rallies during periods of high volatility so that also needs to dissipate which takes time. The flip side is i saw parabolic charts that look exactly like this in crude/agriculture in 08, DDD (3d printing company in 2012), GPRO 90 dollar stock went parabolic now trades at 9...my point is my strategy is to try and average cost around 10k put my stop at 5k eat a 50% loss if wrong and if it breaks below that know that its a bubble and the retail buyer we all need to get to 50k 100k will be burned and never coming back. Seems like not a lot of financial perspective being applied on this thread so curious if I am just not thinking about this the right way with this buyer base. I respect the HODL philosophy but i am not sure how many people are understanding the overall market cap dollar gains that have occured over the % moves. ;7;4;False;villen2001;drlx5s3;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

As you can see from some lines I am drawing here connecting pieces of it, that the trendline is perpendicular to the failing resistance of the square root of your mom so my recommendation is to do a thing and then eat a donut""

But I actually do take some comfort in the idea that price was increasing along a certain parabola all year, and then in December it spiked ""hypodermically"" above that parabola, and so people have not wanted to buy as normal because they figure, well, the price is probably going to come back down. And that the drop back down to the former parabola will be painful but then after that we'll get another 10x or more increase over the course of 2018.

I hope that's a joke.  If not, I would suggest you pull out of bitcoin and focus on stabilizing rather than fantasizing about how you can double down on your money.  That's the same mentality people have when they are behind on a payment and go to the casino to make up for it.

Investing in something this volatile is fun if you have extra cash to burn or simply as a more interesting way of gambling, but if you are going to struggle financially if this doesn't work out, I would personally get out of it now, even if that means getting out at a loss.

If at some point you stabilize to the point where you're not worried about rent, I would still suggest you save some money up as an emergency fund.  And if you want to keep investing at that point, buying safe stocks is a much better bet.

Missing out on an opportunity to get much more out of your money sucks, but struggling to make it from pay check to pay check fucks up your life.

"Be greedy when others are cautions, be cautious  when others are greedy. If you are new to investing in Bitcoin only invest what you are willing to lose as you have an incredible amount to gain. It's not terrible advice for those who have been in this game or know how to safely invest. For example Last month starting on Nov 8, Bitcoin dropped about 25% from $7800 to $5800. Look where we are now. No one who is a longtime HODLer or believer in Bitcoin is shook that this dip is happening. It will stable out and the price will rise again. We buy on these dips and everyone who did  last Nov is still way up. I initially bought in at $300 a BTC way back in 2013. You think this dip worries me I've seen so many of these on the way to where we are now.  I bought as much as I could at 14200 because I believe that is close to the floor of this dip. What shoots up has to correct in order to keep going up, and Bitcoins rise this year has been meteoric ( under 1k at Jan 2017 - 20k Dec 2017) so it's not a bad thing it corrects and builds pressure for the next rise.

 Simultaneously Reddit Crypto boards got flooded by BCH shills bashing BTC and worshiping BCH. And the following day, in a suspiciously convenient time for all the shills Coinbase adds BCH, causing BTC to rapidly plummet and BCH to rapidly rise in a short period of time.
 The cartel probably intended to pump BCH at the expense of BTC, and it worked for them in the short term, but the side effect is that it caused a lot of people to pull out of crypto completely, causing damage to all the Cryptos.

"I think you’re thinking about this in the right way but there’s a fundamental issue that arises: is Bitcoin a currency or just a payment system?  It can’t be a currency since that requires a nation or group of nations to control.  (Yet many hype it as such).  

If it is a payment system then it should trade as a fraction of existing payment systems in part because of the value of networks (like AOL in terms of subscribers or visa/MasterCard in terms of transactions.   

When you frame it as a payment system you have to accept the warts (currently high fees and slow transactions).   

I know you said you are a trader and I’m talking about it as in fundamentals. So slight disconnect there.  But I think what I’m saying is the foundation of why this is a global phenomenon.  It will make less sense to us in the USA than to those either under strict regimes or under toy governments whose fiscal policy is essentially self enriching.  

I researched the shit out of bitcoin before I invested in August. I have a background in payment tech. I wish I had learned about it sooner because it really is amazing technically even with the warts.  I threw $30K at it. Bought some of that in a dip that took a few weeks to sort out.

I will likely buy more on Monday.   As a trader You should know that stocks that have performed the best historically also have had the highest volatility.

"value just means it can be exchanged for something OF value

if someone is willing to give you food for it, then it has value. it's all a psychological concept

just because something is intangible doesn't mean it's not allowed to have value, people buy and sell digital things all the time now. like weapons and armor in games 

if you're asking ""why does it need to exist when we have other things that are a measure of value that do the job better?"" then that's a different answer. the answer to that is, bitcoin was designed to do be better than fiat at two things, being anonymous and being out of the control of a governing power. the third thing, being easy to exchange was on the list of things it should do well but has since fallen off due to unforseen design flaws

other cryptocurrencies built on the back of bitcoin's innovation handle transactions much better

It's not like stocks because those give dividends, which drives how much each stock should be worth. It's not like gold, because gold has a use outside of a store of value and 1000's of years of being established.   
  
Personally I don't see how Bitcoin has a future, but because of my lack of vision I have never made any money off of it, so I really know nothing. It's too risky for me personally, and I've been watching it for a few years.

"Coming from /r/all and have not personally invested in Bitcoin but there is one key issue with how to laid this out and that is the missing the point the in the most of the developed world, computing power is a very real resource that drives many of the luxuries we do.

While (at least as far as I know) the algorithms it does are mostly pointless it is more of building up an environment that one day they can be not useless. What if (trying to do ELI5 example) they helped handle the server load YouTube uses for organizing videos. That is something that they already legitimately pay money for by having to build and power servers to do.

The idea at it's ""core"" makes sense in that computing power and algorithm solving is a ""valuable"" resource in modern world and how the system is scaled and designed ensures the basic functioning of a currency. Just the adoption of this by any wide spread metric is still FAR OFF, and personally likely not even for decades.

Edit: Also on how fast it has grown. While it is a massive jump and there are a LOT of caveats to those stories that ""pluff"" these stories it is key to also look at it from if you invest in a company or tech RIGHT before they took off. If you invested a bit of money into smart phone devices, software tools, etc in 2004/2005 you would be insanely rich today. Take Apple for example which had stock prices at $2 a share in early 2004 that is now worth $175 a share today and Apple was still ""big"" in 2004. Now imagine people more in the know and ground floor who can invest even earlier to get major payoffs. I wouldn't read into those stories no more than friends of major CEO's who got rich by knowing them and pulling small favors when they where small.";2;0;False;;drm3ywv;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

Most of the things you said was correct. But it's not a Ponzi scheme since someone has to get out for others to come in. In a Ponzi scheme people can buy in without anyone leaving, and when there are no more buyers it will inevitably collapse. In a market, a seller can become a buyer again so a collapse is not inevitable. It can be possible or likely or very likely but it's not forced like in a Ponzi scheme.;1;1;False;nuke-from-orbit;drm1ip9;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"The value of bitcoin is that it allows people to buy and sell things. Just like the dollar allows people to buy and sell things, so purchasers and retailers want them, which raises their value. If retailers stopped accepting the currency, its value would fall to zero.

The reason bitcoin went up so much is because it was seen as a reliable currency for doing anonymous transactions. This combined with a limited number of bitcoins in existence. 

Unstable currencies are not good for retailers so I feel gradually more people will start using more stable alternative cryptocurrencies and bitcoin will fall to zero. Its not a ponzi scheme, its a bubble. ";0;1;False;k543;drm1vfz;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

With the right transaction fee it should go through fast but you entered a way to low transaction fees, miners won't pick it up fast. This could take forever.

There are several solutions. Either wait it out, rebroadcat it, replace by fee (RBF protocol), double-spend with higher fee or Child pays for parent (CPFP)

I hardly know anything about XRB, but from my understanding it has pretty good protocols (its similar to IOTA), but has little attention. Bitcoin Cash also has pretty good practices. I believe if any coin overtakes BTC, its going to be Bitcoin Cash. LiteCoin and Bitcoin Cash are pretty much the same thing, except Bitcoin Cash has greater advertising efforts and shares the name Bitcoin. The majority of the public equates cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash wins the spotlight most people wont notice, if LiteCoin starts to take the spotlight a lot of people will be confused and probably resist it, same with any other coin. My bet is that BTC will either adopt the practices of better coins, or it will fall to BCH.;2;0;False;thudrs;drmsnsm;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"If we wanted money and we know its volatile why haven't we all cashed out while we have lots of money? I've been in for 5 years and I'm not even considering selling for another 4 - post halving. I'm a software engineer. I see a technology not a price. A lot of us are tech enthusiasts its what brought us here. One of dozens of 35% plus dips doesn't impact the reasons we are invested at all, nor does 1000's of percent increase. I'll leave when I dislike the projects technical direction or don't see its possibilities to improve the future. It's the same reason the Bcash supporters left. They disliked the technical direction, they didn't care too much that it was fucking them in price. If they did they would have come back. Price is not a significant factor for us long term holders deciding to keep our coins. If it was we would have sold long ago. There is no rational person who is considering price in deciding to hold or not that doesn't sell at 1000's of percent gain. It's why everyone on the outside looking in thinks it's a cult, they only see the irrationality of the decisions being made around price. They have no understanding of the technology or what kind of future bitcoin holders see as being uniquely possible for the first time.

Might take a year, might take 20, but right now BTC is the giant because it was first.

"I'm not invested in Bitcoin. Mainly because it's not scalable aka the more people use it, the bigger the fees get etc. They say Lightning Network will help, but from my own research, I don't think so.

Bitcoin (at the start when it didn't yet face scalability issues)is a good vision on how a currency should be: decentralised, fast, low fees, max supply cap, borderless, you control your money. Try accessing $100k from anywhere in the world within minutes. Only problem for Bitcoin is again the fact that it doesn't scale well. Nakamoto hoped that in the future someone is going to solve the scalability problem.

I personally believe that DASH, XRP, IOTA and XRB(or atleast one of them) will become the main crypto currencies actually used as currencies.

Their will be a crypto currency in the future that will be used as a currency whether you like it or not.

"> Well, really nothing has intrinsic value.

In a certain sense, that's true, but that's not the point here. The important consequence of ""gold has intrinsic value"" is that there are factors that drive demand for gold other than its use as a ""store of value."" 

If the *only* purpose of some asset is as a store of value, then you're entirely reliant on everyone agreeing that it's a store of value - i.e. people value it only because people agree to value it. Without some external source of demand, that's extremely fragile and is virtually the definition of a bubble. All it takes is one good scare and such a bubble will pop for good.

> Right now its mainnet blockchain is the most secure ledger in the planet, its data (transaction history) is more protected and transparent than anything else you can imagine. 

...except for all the other cryptocurrencies with similar or better properties. And that's the killer threat to Bitcoin as a pure store of value. It cannot survive long term if that's its only purpose, because other cryptocurrencies will eventually take over as mediums of exchange and units of account, and those currencies will then make more sense as a store of value.

"You are correct. But sadly in the grand scale of things to come, I fear fiat more than crypto. The purchasing power of that dollar can be just as volatile (granted at a much slower rate of change).

Fast-forward to the year 2020, and we’re going to pay $10 for just the fries and drink. In a relatively small section of time the dollar has lost several hundred percentage points in its purchasing power. For a short while we saw the pay scale rise to match the cost of living... But lets be honest, our current wage earnings are not keeping up pace at all. And that doesn’t even account for the strength of an isolated savings account shriveling up! The cost of living is driving people into poverty, and what’s more important is the fact this pattern is cyclical. Periods of economic growth followed by steep falls into recessions and depressions.

Well, really nothing has intrinsic value.

If gold looses only its scarcity one day, it will loose it value.

"Oh yeah 100% I don't know how it functions. I'm no genius but I tried reading into Bitcoin and it still makes no sense. I cant code but I've got an intermediate knowledge of computers. Idk dude I'm just going by if it sounds like BS, looks like BS, and is perpetuated by people who have something to gain like BS, it just might be BS. Like technically if you got everyone you knew to buy the fairly limited supply Bitcoin the price would have to go up. And in a sense you would make money. But there would be no creation of actual value so that's why I think, IMO, it crashes a lot. It's just the flow of more people buying and then dudes selling, no actual value progression.

&nbsp;

So yeah last post but In my defense I feel like I have some understanding of the economics behind Bitcoin yet I'm trying to help and asking people to sell after pointing out the faults. Just a heads up, unfortunate reality, but some other people definitely understand the faults I'm pointing out but are asking you to buy anyway... So yeah watch out for those guys please

"> There could be 100 million times more dollars in the economy and all that would change is the relative price of things when using that currency.

But that's exactly the problem. If I have $1000 in a bank account, and someone adds 100 million times more dollars into the economy, the price of everything in dollars would go up dramatically, and the money in my bank account would become effectively worthless. That's called inflation.

If the money supply is not restricted, inflation will cause the value of a currency to tend towards zero. Even in the real world cases of hyperinflation, the money supply is still restricted, it's just not restricted enough. If it's not restricted at all, a currency cannot work.

So a limited supply is actually critical to the functioning of a currency.

The rest of your comment has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I was just pointing out that it's incorrect to say, as you did in your first comment, that limited supply is not a condition of value. It's absolutely critical to it.

If you can print more money effortlessly, you create value without providing corresponding value in exchange, and the value of everyone else's money drops.

Note that I'm not saying that ""limited supply"" is a sufficient justification for value on its own. It's a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion.

As an aside, in its current form, a Bitcoin can be sliced into 100 million pieces (satoshis) maximum, so the entire Bitcoin capitalization can't exceed 2100 trillion satoshis.

Once solves, they recieve a reward of 12.5 as of now but it halves every few years IIRC ( so limited supply of 21mil). In order to verify a transaction, you have to get a series of confirmations from a series of miners which essentially ensures that you are sending a legit bitcoin(block contains hash of previous block , hence a chain) so many excahnges/wallets won't accept btc without at least 2 confirmations which will take some time (not instantaneous).  As for the system being overloaded, I agree. There is a set limit of tx's per block of 1mb (~1000 tx's) so you need to insentivise miners to include your tx in their block, so naturally as more and more people send BTc you will have to pay more and more fees. 

So right now, btc is centralized which goes against the very fabric of what it was designed to be like and unscalable with power centralized in places where electricity is cheap, like china and indonesia.

As to venmo, I don't have it so and I don't know how it works, but as I understand it, you just pay money from a credit card into a balance and pay others using that balance. Essentially the same thing as putting money into paypal for instance.

"> But I’m willing to bet we will have absolutely no idea about what’s quantum secure until it hits the world. 

[Post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) is an [active](https://www.pqcrypto.org/) field. This work builds on what we know about [quantum algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm) and [quantum complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory).

IOTA [claims](https://learn.iota.org/faq/what-makes-iota-quantum-secure) they're quantum secure because:
> IOTA uses hash-based signatures (https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/07/18/hashsig.html) instead of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Not only is hash-based signatures a lot faster than ECC, but it also greatly simplifies the overall protocol (signing and verification). What actually makes IOTA quantum-secure is the fact that we use Winternitz signatures. IOTA's ternary hash function is called Curl.

I believe the ""Winternitz signatures"" this refers to are originally described as ""Winternitz one time signatures"" in [this paper from Merkle](http://www.merkle.com/papers/Certified1979.pdf).";2;0;False;zjs;drmnqmd;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

I came for a possible retirement home, perhaps my child's college fund, maybe nothing. It was $250 ( a mere fraction of your investment) ... I almost threw it into my Vanguard. It was gift money.

"Can you explain why? I went through a lot of effort to sell most of my cryptocurrency over the last month when it became obvious that it was in a bubble. The absurdly high fees required to transfer bitcoin to an exchange clearly show it's no longer remotely viable as a currency. I can't imagine why anyone would want to throw more money in to it. The 25X gains in one year was certainly nice for me, but it's just baffling why anyone would want to buy at the top into a currency that no longer has any functionality as a currency. 

I would also never put $15k in something as volatile as crytptocurrency unless my total portfolio was at least $1.5 million. You should allocate no more than a couple percent of your portfolio to ""play money"" and the rest to real investments.";11;2;False;Jaqqarhan;drmsdw9;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Then I stopped paying attention for a long while.

And here we are.

I fully understand that, one day, Bitcoin will reach peak penetration, and that it will largely level off in value.  My first reason for buying in was never to make money, though.  My first reason for buying in was to have a hedge against inflation that still allows me to make online purchases (gold doesn't do this).  Making some return on it is just a happy bonus.

I also never put in more than I can afford to lose.  And I have picked out some price milestones where I will probably sell.";2;0;False;dafunkmonster;drmpy6s;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Did I get burned at Mt Gox, Bit trader and a few other places? Sure did.

"I went through all that back in May... pissed me off then also... but I got in before the insane rush... now is like ""just when I feel like I've seen it all...""

The lesson is ""Buy the dips, when they're actually dips..."" the 20% down after a 1000% gain in a week, that's not a dip... 50+% down, that's a dip... but... if you don't have money on both sides of the volatility, then you're gonna have a bad time. 

""Stops"" are either your best friend, or your worst enemy... you need to have money to buy in lower, yet the long holdings to keep set ""insanely high"" sells... because that's why you're here, right... 

So selling right when the rocket is 1000' off the platform will leave you saying... ""Well, that was stupid.""

These ppl are the same ppl saying it's worthless as if the dollar isn't just as make pretend/manipulated/devalued and in danger of losing it supremacy. It can be a currency, commodity, wealth store, technology, a trust value, a tool for accountability. We can design and fork it to the rules we want for the society we are, a mistrustful bunch of greedy douches. that's revolutionary... it is possible to be all these. It's duality and eventual application in the future can revolutionize our economic/political systems and institutions of power whether or not the populace understands it. If we let it.

Pick a stock in the doghouse that you believe will turn around in 5 years.  Do some research and if you find something undervalued with a dividend, your strategy will pay off.  There's a reason Buffet states that compounding interest is the only way to make money.  Safely, securely and not gambling.

If you're after the gamble, then go for it but I wouldn't employ a buy and hold strategy for that.  Buy the dips sell the peaks and keep a close eye on and don't get greedy.  ";1;1;False;Archisoft;drmppk8;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"Just to put a different perspective on this for people.  The whole year there has been a slow burning mania that slowly build.  We are not at the phase where people are literally taking out loans against their housed to buy bitcoin.  We are at a peak level of buying pressure.

This was teh top for a long time.  Yes we will probably bounce from here to 16-18k and make peope hopeful again.  And that will be your chance to get out before a bear market that turns into consolidation between 5 and 10k.  

The technology has been outpaced by the mania and things will need to even out.  Im sure in a year or 2 we will be back above 20k.  But if your one of those peope that took out loans or used money you cant lose you will have one last chance to get out before a long term downtrend followed by consolidation.

The new guys actually have an incentive to continue holding. They got into the crypto game to make money, not lose it. They're going to continue holding until they make their money back or profit.

The holders from 2016 and earlier could cash out now if they cant handle the pressure. They're already making a lot of money, just less than they would've made a week ago.

I've never had to work harder to throw money at something before between the exchanges not accepting new people to verification, 6-10 day long bank transfers, weekly coinbase caps, etc.

Point is there's a huge future for all of this stuff, IMO. It's fun to stare at the ticker and ride the emotional roller coaster of your portfolio fluctuating more on a daily basis than a U.S stock portfolio does in a year, but this isn't a 24/7 upward trend.

Here's the way I look at it: Bitcoin is either everything so many  brilliant young minds think it is, or its vapor.  Thus, the value of one bitcoin is either well above $100k, or zero.

The problem with your comment is you start by saying if the money stops flowing, there is a collapse. But you don’t acknowledge that the entire issue with bitcoin is that the money CANT flow. Therefore by your logic it is already in a collapse, you just don’t see it yet. Fiat flows, if it stops that’s a problem. Bitcoin doesn’t flow in any real volume, it never has, it possibly never will. The value you see right now is not it beginning to flow, it’s people gambling. Bitcoin isn’t a currency right now, it can’t really be compared to one. It’s more like a bunch of rare pokemon cards that a bunch of people realized they could make money by investing in. Everyone wants to make money, nobody actually gives a shit about Pokémon cards. You don’t wanna be the person with the ultra rare charzard when the world figures that out. ;1;0;False;bobsmithjohnson;drlyff0;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

It's one of the reasons that I think the hatred people have of BCH is completely unwarranted. At worst it's competition that forces their favorite coin to win its support by improving.

"I have not confirmed this myself, but I read that while Kohl's is always on sale, their MSRPs do not change. So if something is on sale for 40% off, you know you're saving money compared to it being 30% off. Other companies, such as J. Crew Factory, have a similar model but inflate the MSRPs, so unless you track the specific sale prices it's harder to know if the ""40% off"" you're getting is actually any better than the 30% off the week prior. So while the value of Kohl's clothing is definitely not the MSRP value, it's still reasonably possible to find out if you're actually getting a deal on something.

"But it seldom varies more than 1% every day. Because these currencies are used to purchase large amounts of goods. If there is a big discrepancy say between gold bought in USD and gold bought in EUR then traders will do what is called ""arbitrage"" to exploit this anomaly and with time this anomaly will correct, either by self-adjusting exchange rates or by having the arbitrage plays affecting the markets. For instance of too many traders buy gold in EUR to sell it in USD brcause they saw a price difference, the buys will increase the price of gold in EUR, bridging the anomaly.

This is an ages old phenomenon and fortunes are made on large volumes.

"Well, right now it's main feature over other coins is adoption, a solid developer team, and 'trust'.  Besides the adoption, they might not be on the top of the curve on all of them, but it has the most complete complement of everything.  

If you look at any other coin, it's possible that they wouldn't actually be able to handle the volume BC is experiencing right now any better than it does.  for instance, a coin that could handle the technical volume or 'easy for the end user' might be one that could get hacked halfway through an upswing, or a newer coin is going to have to really outshine the others to get the adoption it needs.

As for developers, the core team might not be great at the political side, and holding off on a block size increase, while done for a reason that might not have been accomplished by any other way, might not have been the best idea, going with some other teams would almost certainly have resulted in multiple attack vectors not being mitigated, crashes, splits, rollbacks, god knows what.  It may be EXTREMELY frustrating waiting for a team to do something, but having it done right is better than having it done quick.  

For that matter, if other coins are so good, and bitcoin is so shit, why doesn't one of them take off. Or, better yet, if bitcoin is so frustrating right now, why doesn't one of them take off in the meantime while bitcoins flaws are addressed...if one of them branded itself a temporary 'lightning network', it could see mass adoption while using bitcoin as the store of value, just like bitcoin is 'doing' right now.";1;1;False;dnick;drmxd4c;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

"No, people buying it are doing so because they hope to get back double by this time next year. _No one_ can guarantee that. Charts showing a trend are OK if you are an experienced trader and know the risks.

The fact that it kept rising does not mean it will continue to do so, not because of market mechanics but because people might start to be more cautious.

This drop was due to people needing cash for the holidays. Pretty easy to spend $1000 you did not have a month ago on a brand new TV when all you had to do for it was wait on an investment.

Problem is so many people wanted to sell and so few to buy that the price naturally went down. The fact that it went down so much means people were OK with selling even at 13k down from 19k because they all started from an even smaller investment.

All of this means it is a _very_ unstable investment. Anyone putting money into it because they think it's they way to make it a viable currency is wrong.

This is not a currency and will never be one because for it to become one all the people hoping for a huge return (using it for short term risky investments) would need to stop using it. And the only reason they'd stop would be if trust in it would be destroyed. When that happens it will take down _any_ credibility it ever had or ever hoped to have and the chance of it becoming a currency.";5;0;False;sergiuspk;drmi5ex;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

"> First, you're assuming rational actors.

All actors are rational to the actor making that decision otherwise they would not make that decision.  You may place some external value on an actors decision and deem it to be irrational, they might agree if they also had that same information.  Even a completely unhinged crazy person burning his clothes during a blizzard is acting rationally based on the information they have.

> Second, you're making dangerous assumptions about the behavior of corporations in markets.

Whoa, ""dangerous"" yikes that sounds terrifying.

> A smart company would not price-gouge and would immediately begin rerouting resources to that area for 2 reasons. 1) sales volume, 2) public relations.

You're absolutely right, so why do we need price gouging laws?

> Demand spikes during environmental disasters and news coverage usually starts before the disaster actually hits, so there is plenty of time for companies to do this and plenty of incentive for them, considering they have a heads up that demand is about to spike and where specifically it will spike.

Most disasters happen without warning with the notable exception of weather related phenomena which can be forecast.

> You're also assuming that the population who needs it the most overlaps with the population that has the resources to afford it the most. That's almost certainly the direct opposite of true on several distinct levels.

You're correct the world isn't fair but the vast majority is generous and charitable.  Look to any disaster and you'll see people helping each other.

> In short, your ideas about markets are outdated and underinformed.

This isn't a one-shot deal. Whichever motivation you systematically feed will continue to be in effect even when we're not in emergency situations. So, for example, when you have greedy business people leveraging their power to put greedy politicians in office and lobby them, you get local budgets allocated disproportionately towards things that benefit those businesses... and not.. say...

"> All actors are rational to the actor making that decision otherwise they would not make that decision.

While you're accurately describing bounded rationality, that does not make even every decision made within the scope of that rational. People can, and do, act outside of their own best interests even when informed. Some decisions are impaired by information visibility for the individual. There is an entire universe of other decisions impaired by faulty decision weighting. I don't mean faulty decision weighting from an outside perspective. I mean that people make decisions in a moment that they understand in the moment and/or afterwards that are definitely ""bad"" decisions or have undesirable and foreseeable consequences. So, even if we're only talking about internal consistency, When rational actor model was debunked, the model that immediately supplanted it (rational choice theory) included instances of biased decision weights (heuristics and biases usually but also motivated reasoning in general). 

>Whoa, ""dangerous"" yikes that sounds terrifying.

Danger is what occurs when entire markets begin operating under systems which ultimately cost human lives. So, yes, your reasoning is dangerous. 

>Your absolutely right, so why do we need price gouging laws?

You're, and the answer should be obvious. Not every company has the capacity or the desire to be smart. Ideally, companies should operate in such a way that guarantees future, happy, repeat business. A company that does not have that interest will not use strategies that lead to that outcome over strategies that lead to outcomes they prefer. A company that's being pumped before being liquidated, for example, will favor other strategies. 

>Most disasters happen without warning with the notable exception of weather related phenomena which can be forecast.

Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation. It has an assigned value only because the government uses its power to enforce the value of a fiat currency. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity).

Obesity is capitalism's version of starvation and we lead the entire planet in it, **AND** we still have people actually starving on top of that. Instead of people starving to death flat out (acute, quick, most people view as horrifying), we have people in a state of chronic micronutrient deficiency, resulting in a panoply of conditions that are typically painful and debilitating and several of which are lethal (chronic, slow, most people do not view as horrifying but rather as pitiful). 

Don't call yourself a social democrat when you're sounding more and more like a neoliberal. Their problem isn't inflation. Their problem is that they don't have a sustainable relationship between the amount of food available and the amount of food they need, and you know it. One way to ameliorate their problem in the future is to centrally administrate a physically decentralized network of urban farms (ie, every arable square foot of land is used for vsf permaculture farming and every citizen participates in its upkeep). That would be closer to the socialist ideal society AND it would be viable no matter what the state of their fiscal market was. You also know that, I'm sure. So your argument boils down to some emotional appeal rooted in ""won't someone please think of the children"". You went with baby formula for a reason, chief.

"Not sure about contradicting...I read it as a statement that he will 'keep buying even as it continues to go down', with the assumption that it will continue to go down.  Sure it would be ideal to wait until it hits bottom, but since no one can tell where that bottom will be it would be a missed opportunity to try to wait for that.

at least this way, if it rebounds quickly, he will have bought at 'this' level...for example, suppose he bought at 14, 12, 11, 10 and 9 and then as it approaches 8 it quickly rebounds to 11 and then back to 14....if he was watching and trying to anticipate that it would get to 8 and buy there, he would quickly miss the opportunity to buy at 10, 11, 12, etc. This has happened so many times in the past that people focusing on the 'huge' drop in price totally miss out on the dynamics of a highly volatile but rising product.  Maybe it will crash here, maybe it will crash after it reaches 50 or 100, maybe never...but that doesn't make buying on the way down bad in itself.

Keep a cool head. Everyone should have been expecting a crash since it hit 10k. I never expected it to go above 30k without first a major crash below 10k. Anything is possible but treat a better outcome than previous bubbles as a bonus, not an expectation. 


There is always the ""this time it's different"" mentality. This time it's because of big money entering the scene in a number of relatively small ways. Don't fall into the trap. Be prepared for a crash at every shiny 10x of the last bubble high.


I'm not saying that this time will be the same but don't go in expecting it to not crash because you could very well be disappointed. If you think you might become suicidal if it goes down to 2-5k, look at the big picture and either have patience after the crash or hedge against it.


2018 is going to be a very interesting year for Bitcoin. This may garner attention like it has never done before. So it is possible it could go up sooner than later but the last crash down below 1k lasted almost 2 years and people then were saying it would be different. But even so, prepare for the possibility of this being *the* crash because historically, there has always been a big crash before the next 10x. Whether it last a few months (crash down from 257) or it last nearly 2 years (crash down from 1k in 2015).";4;0;False;mokahless;drme64x;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

"Hello crypto developers 

The company that weathers the storm today and looks the strongest to investors will be one of the top players in this industry. (A BUY-BACK) on all open shares will stabilize each currency. The stock market and all countries do buy backs to stabilize. 

Now let's discuss why cryptocurrency and block chains were created, right? A new balance to government regulation and institutions that control everything. This was the way the little guy could balance justice and good. The stock market and all TV stations everywhere do nothing but report the negativity of bitcoins, well guess what they do not want anything or anyone disrupting their stock market and their jobs. This little downturn has happened to the stock market which has come back to be highest ever and now this will be a date in history as happening to the cryptocurrency coins and now it's up to all of us to create the biggest return in history as this is a viable industry and will survive. 
One last rant: we need a crypto TV station, some billionaire cyrptonian needs to launch a satellite.

"I agree with some of what you're saying

***buuuuut***

bitcoin is more than just a volatile ""pump and dump"" asset.

There is real, legitimate, unique value in using a blockchain to track ownership of tokens, and by having the largest-use, longest established network, bitcoin has the highest fundamental value of any cryptocurrency/asset.

Will BTC work like cash one day?  Maybe.  That would be enormous if it happens.  IF no major technical innovations occur, BTC still remains a cheap, easy, ***uncensorable*** transfer of value between parties that don't have to know or trust each other.  There is value in that -- there is no better way than bitcoin (for instance) to buy and sell black/grey market goods, or to transfer a million dollars internationally (bonus points for needing secrecy).

While I agree nobody should be surprised, and BTC isn't a good long term investment strategy, I think speculation is reasonable.  I think there's *no way in hell* that there isn't a strong fundamental valuation for BTC for only its use as an international money transfer method or as a black market currency.";-3;0;False;CactusSmackedus;drmg23m;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

"Anyone putting their money into BTC right now is doing so not in the belief that it is a viable currency now, but in the belief that future developments will make it a viable currency.

It needs more price stability. Increased adoption, futures, bank involvement, and fewer people seeing it as quick money will hopefully eventually lead to this.

It needs lower fees. This issue has been beaten to death, but the existence of ETH, LTC, and BCH along with their ready availability to the general public are stopping people from completely counting out crypto right now. If it weren't for altcoins, faith in the future of BTC would be incredibly low.

People can meme about hodling all they want, but all it does is artificially force BTC/USD higher than it would otherwise be and increase their reliance on the support that altcoins with lower transaction costs give in the short term.

"This!!!!  I am so tired of hearing the ""it's going to go up because it will be a currency one day"" nonsense.  

By definition it's never going to be used as anything more than an asset or a novelty currency until 

1) It's purchasing power has stayed predictably flat long enough that people have confidence the purchasing power today, will be roughly the same as the purchasing power in 2-3 years.

2) A large number of transactions for goods and services (not just bitcoin to other currencies) are performed in bitcoin.

These two things are the exact opposite of the HODL mentality.  In fact the large number of HODLers waiting for this to become a currency is likely the biggest roadblock to it ACTUALLY becoming a currency :)

"Valuation charts without considering volume are idiotic. For example, yes, someone traded a pizza for 10k. That is a volume of maybe a handful of trades.

Do a volume chart. 

The volume is still hovering ATH levels, even with lowered valuation. This means confidence is almost exactly where it was when it was at ~$20k, when it is down 50% in value.

As more volume happens, more price discovery happens, and less volatility happens. 

Right now, any volume ""spikes"" are hand in hand with valuation swings, because the volume is so very, very low.

More volume is what we're after. All the bullshit about confidence lost or ""hey this isn't a currency"" are just new weak hands wringing themselves.";2;0;False;eqleriq;drmgjod;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png
"So I was trying to recreate that fit.  Having a real hard time of it.  

The ""fit"" is presented as y=2.9065*ln(x)-19.493

So, as a starting point, let's solve for an X to see what type of values we should be using for X.  

On or about 12/31/2017 the bitcoin price should hit $10,000.  

10000 = 2.9065*ln(x) - 19.493

Simplified to:

3447.271 = ln(x)

so exp (3447.271) = x  Correct?  What is the units on the abscissa then?  femtoseconds?  Because whatever number represents Dec 31 of this year is massive!!!

So I took a different approach.  Try to recreate the line in Excel then try to determine the constants.  So I cut out the graph in GIMP, imported it as a background in an excel chart and adjusted the chart accordingly.  

For Excel every incremental day = 1.  So the chart begins on day 39814.0 of excel time and ends on 45657.0.  If you do this you'll see that the creator of this chart used days of length = 370 days.  

Next up, some try my best to get the values to align with the fit.  I know this formatting is going to get screwed up but anyone following along this far should be able to extract the necessary data from it.  

40178	0.005
40543	0.5
40908	6.7
41273	45
41638	200
42004	700
42369	1800
42735	4500
43100	10000
43465	22000
43830	40000
44195	70000
44560	105000
44925	200000
45290	300000
45655	500000

Anyhow, you plot those points on a log bit coin value vs days plot and you get

y = 2,605,792.96ln(x) - 27,715,640.91

and....my fit looks nothing like the red line fit.  

So I don't know what that line represents but it doesn't appear to be represented by the equation on the chart.

It's a new asset class, with bitcoin the defacto exchange currency for other cryptos. It has the largest market cap and the greatest (growing) institutional support. Crypto is here to stay - the technology is too disruptive not to be. For the medium term I see bitcoin remaining the crypto flagship. Primacy counts for a lot. Whether bitcoin will end up as the AOL or the Google of the crypto space, the verdict's still out on that one (but the lightning network is encouraging). As for final, stable price (if it gets there), who's to say... If you believe bitcoin has the potential to replace gold as a store of value, then that would put it at about $500k/bitcon. That's ambitious but not impossible (just very speculative). Personally, I think it's very reasonable to assume bitcoin in the near term will reach about 10% the size of the gold market, so $50k - it really depends what other cryptos do from there.;4;1;False;HawkinsT;drmhjc6;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/

"Or I'm just really good at gambling lmfao.

I made .150 last night alone.

It's nothing new.

I can lose 1BTC in a week, make 3 the next week.

Shit is liquid to me.

I already cashed out 10x my initial investment of $2000. (sold 1.25BTC at $19500)

I am on house money and have plenty of it to fuck around with.

If I lost it all in a months time I wouldn't even be phased.

Gambling isn't for the weak. That's why dips don't even have an effect on me, as it is just like a really bad losing streak happened all at once.

My salary is shit in reality, but I'll tell you the secret to gambling: once you've won, you cannot act like a loser just because you ""could have made more"".

If I have all my BTC this time next year, congrats to me.

If not, I made $20k and I'm a relatively poor guy so to me that is epic winning.

Yes, I could just make myself rich if I sold everything, but I see a future in crypto and want to own it 25years from now. Also, I recognize my ""addiction"" and have set myself up so I can feed it safely, and still have won even if everything I have in crypto disappears due to my stupidity.

Yes, I did just admit I am an idiot. 

But I'm also a really good handicapper and I cannot deny that fact.

When you have a 58%+ win rate 2 years going and you taught yourself everything it's hard to tell yourself that you aren't good at it.

I never thought it would be my forte, but I have gotten so good I started my own site and have affiliates, followers, donators and all.

It gives me a sense of success to have built this all on my own, this whole handicapping thing is something I never thought I would become but I like to just roll the dice on life and follow where my strengths lie.

"Don't project your all-or-nothing attitude onto the situation.

My point was just about how I experienced a dip in the stock market which bit me right when I first started earning income, and how it all turned out fine within a year.

My aside about the 401k is not some all-or-nothing rejection of it, I just said it's overrated to begin with and I never should have been putting near the max yearly contribution like I was. It's hard to beat the employer-matched amount (the matching isn't really free money since there's still an opportunity cost. More like cheap money.) Other than that, currently my 401k is still my weakest investment. It might be better than my house but I don't count my house as an investment. The selling point should be that the 401k is my safest investment, although with it being locked up for decades that leaves a lot of time for the banks or government to fuck it up for me.";0;0;False;zzbzq;drm90g7;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/

That first million for essentially doing nothing, is a lot more rewarding and calming than (MAYBE) having a few more million 3 years from now--with the downside of losing it all. 

To each his own and if they had sold they'd have nothing, but if I had thousands of bitcoins I would have sold at $15k enough to have FU money. You can withdraw 3%-4% for life.

"Fiat has no intrinsic value either unless you count burning it for heat. 

The only things with intrinsic value are commodities like gold, silver, etc. Everything else including stock are only worth what people will give unless you can own enough stock to actually change the company. 

99% of us don't have that kind of money, so to us stock and btc are the same; it is just an investment vehicle. However, stock is incredibly difficult to trade for goods while btc can be traded fairly easily (high fees though atm though).

My point is that we use USD as a baseline but it isn't required to give BTC or any other coin value. Without fiat it would still hold value, we would probably compare it to gold though.

"My first year of working full-time, I put a bunch of extra payments in my 401k, thinking I would get ahead. Instead, the account lost like 5% money. I was furious, it was like putting money into a black hole.

Fast forward several years and the annual returns for each subsequent year after that bad first year have exceeded projections. With my continued payments combined with interest, the account has 10s of thousands $ in it and is on proper track for recommended retirement levels.

I learned my lesson and stopped throwing most extra payments in the 401k though. It's not that great of an investment.

"No. It has no intrinsic value of its own. If there was no fiat value assigned to it, you wouldn't be able to spend it on anything. It's traded like a stock, but with nothing backing it.  

Now If you were able to remove all currency globally overnight, then introduce this concept, you could maybe make it work. But not if you introduced 1000 variants of it. 

The end goal of crypto in a perfect world, would be to replace all fiat currency.  But that is decades, or more, in the future. 

For now, its value is determined 100% by fiat currency. 

Take a loaf of bread. It costs 5 bucks. You could trade .00038 (~13k value right now) btc for it, assuming you could find a vendor willing to accept it. Ignoring the glaringly high transaction fees, if the price of btc changed between when you grabbed the loaf off a shelf, and when you got to the register, the cost of the bread in btc would change. Why? Because the btc value is DIRECTLY tied to and backed by fiat currency.

If you let your emotions get the better of you,  buy high, sell low is the result.  ;1;0;False;lykewtf;drmlez6;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/
"I just bought bitcoin yesterday. About 10k of etherium, bitcoin, and lite coin.

My only regret is not buying today but buying yesterday. 

But you know what? My losses are only losses if I sell.

You don't sell low.

I've had 10k sitting in the bank for multiple years doing nothing for me. I can lose it. But I'm only going to lose it if I sell. 

I bought this to reassess selling it in one year. I'm investing in the idea and the possibility to make big gains. I might lose. But we all knew that going in. If you sell every time this shit crashes 30% you'll never make any money. 

If your rent or other significant piece of life is tied to bitcoin, you shouldn't be investing in bitcoin. It's a place to store some money that you're not doing anything with otherwise.

"Not me, apparently, but I think I've learned from it. I made a really bad impulse decision that made me lose even more than necessary.  

I had been hearing the news about BCH insider trading and the coordinated attack on BTC and thought hey that's shady, but since my interest was investing, I couldn't argue with the fact that BTC was in sharp decline while BCH was rising fast. So what did I do? I sold my weekly max worth of BTC and threw it all on BCH. It was at an ATH when I bought and then it literally never went up a dime from there, instead crashing harder than BTC. This completely erased all the progress I made in 2 months, and even got so bad that I could no longer say ""At least I didn't lose any of the real money that I put into it"" because the losses cut into that too. I used all my buy and sell limit so I couldn't immediately reverse my bad choice and sell all the BCH and and put it back on BTC, and just stomach the several hundred dollars in fees. I have to wait a few days until I can totally fix this.  

But luckily the price looks like it's going back up for all cryptos. That's just in the past 2 hours, but I'm trying to be optimistic.  

tl;dr - I fell for the BCH trap and went all in. Don't do that.";1;0;False;Phil_Drill;drmnhxy;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/

"My reaction after experiencing MANY 50% over night drops.

If you have invested what you can afford to lose and see nothing has changed about your investment sit tight and DCA (dollar cost average).

With Ethereum I think almost every one of my buys came at tops.  $10, $20, $50, even had some at $386 that I finally cleared out with profit as it broached to the new ATH.

I keep telling people if you get a double or really say a triple on your money,

SELL SOME so you have cash in case it drops (or rises), and can ride pure profit.

I use this mentality with alts and it has served me well.

Be warned here this Bitcoin and crypto run up started in the ~3-5k range and I'm quite convinced it was big money front running cboe and cme trading.

I'm also convinced these players have it in mind to crash this back to those levels to try to shake out all the new bigger money that will not be able to withstand losses and will sell.

So be warned we could see another 50% leg down here to under $10k.   I do not think if we see $5k that price will last long.  Too many of us longer time holders took profits above $10k will be happy to buy at $5k or lower.

Remember the really big money is here to play and $400B or so of market cap is nothing to them.

I had a flash vision a long time ago of the 1mBTC price on bitcoinity.org being $100 when it was $1 (or BTC first hit $1000) I am still convinced this will unfold.   But do no buy on some internet persons vision.

I am convinced we are going to new ATH across the board and will cross the $1T marketcap.   So yes I'm nibbling here, trading the rises so I recycle and add cash.

You know you are doing well when the 50% crack off the old time high that may take thousands or millions in hours off your stack is only a slight event in a day.

I think the real big issue here (and I have been and still support the Core vision) is that the network needs a bit of breathing room on capacity.    Everyone - not just old adopters, but all the new people really need to see what Bitcoin is capable of with a modest block size increase, while Segwit is coming into play, and Lightning is being worked on.  Too many people that now hold Bitcoin don't really realize how nice it was to send $100 or $1Million for $.1 anywhere in the world in less than an hour.

I said this before.  If we can get some relief on the tx capacity front with the Biggest coin the price of it will double or triple AND the bonus is that people who were trying to use it for business will be able to again.

For many people a $1 fee is already too high, for literally the rest $10-50 fees and long times to confirm pretty much take away all of the utility of Bitcoin and this is my biggest concern.   Honestly I think we just need a unified wallet and people to get on board with more than one coin.  If Bitcoin is blocked up, use Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, Lumens, whatever.

I see integrated wallets that can use MANY coins being needed NOW so if one network is clogged we could use another one.  The key here is that business integration needs to be a kind of global thing.  Do one software integration and get like 10-20 of the major coins, that can connect to an exchange and this whole which coin we use to buy stuff goes away quickly.   It makes business integration of crypto a 1 step for many coins, vs. 1 step per coin.

Anyway.   Wishing all the best to everyone.   Buy, Hold, Sell do whatever you need to do.   But be warned crypto can and does these crazy moves all the time.

I personally think the CNBC interview with Roger Ver a day or two ago probably was one of the prime causes of the recent drop.  Add on the rumor of S2X being resurrected and voila market drop.. 


The above is precisely WHY I think important people in crypto need to stop pissing on other coins.  All it does is make them look like jerks and doesn't help the space at all.  Point out the problems, but also point out that these problems are well known and being worked on by a lot of people.

I do think that Core should consider carefully putting their support behind a 2x block size increase.   Litecoin already has all of this and a faster block rate.  Nothing crazy happened with centralization imo  (if I'm wrong please post links to relevant info).

We already got SegWit so ASICboost seems to be thwarted..  Perhaps its time to build in some capacity increases.   Say a boost to 1.5MB/blocks with 10% yearly increases (set to occur at various blocks) built in to get to 2MB simply to provide some relief.

Well now you can ban me here because I'm a large block heretic (which I'm not btw).   I think everyone would agree we just need a bit of breathing room and I know Core is well aware of this.

Number one rule in investing. Don't invest in something you don't understand. If someone put money in Bitcoin not realizing its volatile... well.. that's kinda on them. Also don't invest more than your willing to lose. Pretty simple.

"What's happening kind of brings to light the real reason for hodling. Imagine you're just some scum bag middle class like we all are, with more money into this whole thing than you should have. You still run around preaching to your friends not to put more into it than you're willing to lose. Meanwhile, you have your fingers crossed that your last investment taken from your line of credit will double so that you can take out the profit and no longer have any borrowed money into the game. You get home from work after watching a stale market all day, not knowing what will happen, but hoping for the best. WHY THE HELL ISN'T THE MARKET SKY ROCKETING?!?!?! It already did, dumbass... You don't check your phone around your wife because she's been nagging at your for being addicted... Even though your initial investment into Bitcoin quadrupled. You get the kids to bed while sneaking a peak before you throw them into the bath. Bitcoin went from 20500 CND to 19000 since the last time you checked. The little one has his eyes closed and you pull your phone out... It's 18000. You fumble around trying to sell at the lowest sell, but not the highest buy -just trying to recover as much as possible. It doesn't happen. 17000. 16500. This happens in minutes. You missed your sell, it's going to 16... No. Wait. It's back to 17. Now it's at 18500. Luckily your slow, dumb ass missed what you thought was a good time to sell, because you would have lost.

I’ve hedl Bitcoin since 2012 and like every market, every few months there is a correction, granted this is holiday shopping induced seasonality but when you’ve been trading numerous assets for all long as I have I’ve learned the most profitable trades I’ve made were trades when everyone was petrified and indiscriminately selling, and blood in the streets.

"So many people saying they still feel good because they got in at 5-10K. 

That means they've been ""invested"" for what, a month? If this tanks to 8-9K, anyone who is leveraged has to get out, and anyone that bought due to fear of missing out will freak out and sell. 

It could easily wipe out from 8-9K down to 3-4K or lower. If the bids disappear, the price can just evaporate. A move like that will pretty much ensure the general public stays away from it.

"Seriously people always made the same mistake when it come to investment be it in crypto, forex or other investment platform.

Here some simple advice to prevent you from sliding further. Make a Plan and Execute. Plan carefully how many %age of your capital you want to turn into BTC/other crypto with the price level you deem worth to buy into. And with that ENTRY plan in place, you should also make an EXIT plan or the %age of investment you're willing to take (at profit) or lose (at loss) then EXECUTE all of your plan without hesitation. Do this and you can HODLing your sanity back.

If you plan to do some averaging (buying more with larger quantity as the price drops) you can do so but keep in mind, this can only be done if you have high capital on your side and solid plan of entry

"Here's my most laid back plan if you want to invest in btc purely for profit (cause you don't believe in the technology, only $$$):

1. Buy btc for an amount your comfortable losing (be it 2k, 20k or 200k for rich or risk-accepting people).

2. Set preset price points where you would sell a percentage of your holding. Say 10%

3. if you hit your price mark, next mark is double that, where you sell another 10% (of original holding). So if price doubles 10 times you're out of btc.

3.b Every time price doubles you take out twice the value of your last time cashing out, but always slightly more than the sum total of all previous cashing outs.

4 You are not allowed to take out cash until 10 years from buying, except when following the above.

Instead of worrying about price fluctuations such a plan, would remove all the stress around everything, as long as you have the mindset that your investment; you're willing to lose it, or at the very least not ever see ROI!

This is written partly as a joke, but really it's not a bad idea when dealing with a high-volative currency like bitcoin, and you're not Warren Buffet.

If you got into bitcoin at the very start when it was 0.00x$- 9.99$ and you followed such a strategy to today, then well, you'd be a very happy camper. If you believed that during your lifetime, btc might be potentially at 1M$, and you wanted to keep 50% of btcs purchased when it was at (for example) around 1$, you could sell about 1.5% of inital holding whenever btc doubled. 

That would make you about ROIed in cash, at about 32$ (while still keeping 92.5% of initial bitcoin holding, which would make you ~3000% ROIed, but you don't sell that yet, sticking to plan).

But adopting the above model of 1.5% every price jump is ridiculous today, since the potential for increase like it was before just isn't there.

Still, it'd be a fun project and a ""sound investment plan"" if you REALLY believed in bitcoin back in the day and wanted to make a profit in FIAT as well. Since you could invest 20k dollars (for example, yet again) in something you really believed in, but were willing to lose, AND this is maybe the most important: you're not so greedy or unstable that you care about more money. selling, say 300 btc when it hit 15k usd, you have more than enough money, and you don't ""care"" that you could sell 10.000 btc and ""never need to work again"" at that price, cause you're following the plan.";2;1;False;Daniblitz;drm9axo;<---- Number of Hodlers with Strong Hands;7ler9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ler9l/number_of_hodlers_with_strong_hands/

We own a little BTC. My wife got drawn in by me in 2016 now she panics, she wants to sell. All she saw was one long moon trip and she thought she could handle the dips. She knew nothing. She made retirement plans and what not. The worst part is that we ave an argument about it while I always reminded her that we are in for the long game and that 50% drop don't matter. I told her to sell her part if she doesn't believe me. But i fear a rebound would endanger our marriage.

Bought 200 ANS/NEO at $3, sold them back to BTC/ETH at $50, then rode the IOTA train from $.80 to $5.50, so I turned less than $1000 into damn near $20,000 over the span of a few months.

"For the people coming from r/all , here's a handy guide on the different types of users found in r/bitcoin:

The OG: this guy got on the train and left the station before most others even had a destination. He bought in so early that the risks are almost zero and the potential gains are huge. Here we have an example right in front of us. This cat bought in at 300 so he's most likely going to make a tidy profit. The OG can be recognized by a carefree attitude as they sit back with a bowl of popcorn, content to watch the filthy masses struggle as they bask in the knowledge that they're going to come out ahead in virtually every scenario short of a Chernobyl level disaster. 

The Gambler: Probably the most intelligent, or at least the most honest kind of user found here. The Gambler is well aware of the dangers and pitfalls of bitcoin and attempts to skillfully avoid them. He plays it fast and loose, buying and selling in the short term in response to fluctuations in value. The Gambler will usually let you know straight up that what they're doing is essentially gambling and shouldn't be attempted by new players. 

The Snake 🐍: the most dangerous and second most common user you'll find here. If the OG was the first to leave the station, the snake is the one who jumped at the last second and just barely made it onto the caboose. The snake usually has substantial stake in bitcoin, and stands to either lose big or win big. They will do what little they can to influence this result by encouraging others to make poor and hasty decisions for the snake's benefit. You can almost always recognize the snake by quotes such as ""why are people panicking? They're just shaking out the weak hands. HODL"" or ""looks like bitcoin took a dip today, time to buy 😎."" The calm and collected facade they put up is a deception to mask the fact that their buttox are clenched hard enough to crack a walnut and their blood pressure spikes in response to every tiny dip. The snake wants to get as many people to buy bitcoin as possible to drive up the value of their own investment. It doesn't matter if you're struggling to pay rent, or down to your last dollar for that matter. If you ask The Snake if you should buy bitcoin, the answer will always be yes. Beware the snake.

The Sheep: The newbies. They just showed up at the station and are wondering where the train went. They probably heard about bitcoin from a friend or from an article they just read. They don't know anything about what they're getting into besides the fact that they're supposed to make easy money here. They could have sunk a couple thousand or a quarter million into this market depending on how much they have. There are go getters and there are those who get got. The sheep has been got. If you heard about bitcoin on CNN or bought in in the last 1-2 months, sorry, you're a sheep.

The True Believer: The rarest type of user, perhaps making up only 2-3% of the population. You'll know the true believer when you encounter him. He won't stop talking about how blockchain technology is the future and how it's going to revolutionize finance as we know it (Spiel may contain elements of anarcho-capitalism ideology). The True Believer genuinely believes that blockchain is the future, and who are we to say he's wrong? The True Believer often seems to hold the money making aspect as a secondary concern, and will sometimes make a Buddha-like comment about how ""Bitcoin may die, but blockchain will live on.""

The Doomsayer: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. The Doomsayer knows the bridge that spans the next valley is fatally flawed. He attempts to yell to the passing train to turn back, for the passengers to jump off, but his warnings are dismissed as the ravings of a bitter old man. The Doomsayer knows bitcoin is in a bubble that is bound to burst. It should happen this month...or the next...or sometime next year. One thing is certain, the end is near. 

Hope this handy guide helps you on your travels. Happy hunting.

"Linden Dollars were also the launching point for my first BTC purchase, but it was a few months after yours so I was on an exchange. I remember converting MYR to USD to Linden Dollars to BTC and finally sending it over to my wallet, losing 10% - 20% in transaction fees each time. It was quite a hassle but I was very glad to finally own a bit of Bitcoin.

Then China did China things and the price went from the ATH of $1000ish down to $200ish and I went ""oh well"" and kinda forgot about it until January of this year when it hit $1000 again.

"Ah thanks.

It's nice to feel validated.

Part of the Bitcoin rise is due to it's name and since Litecoin is the second most popular, I figured it would have similar effects.

Etherium is on Coinbase along with those two and the 3rd most popular and the one that's shown the strongest growth long term, which emotional/greedy gamblers/""investors"" ignored.

I figured the strong rise would follow with the emotional high running out, possible withdrawal from big investors ""painting the tape"" and people cashing out for x-mas.

I think Bitcoin might be dead at this point since it took a few minutes to download the first few years of the ledger and hours to download the last few months when I bought at $4k.

Here a video showing the average ""investor"" on Reddit in a few seconds of this video clip.

https://youtu.be/-yjrmIIpgo0?t=14m7s

Also, people say you can use Bitcoin anonymously?

XD

That's the dumbest thing I've heard.

It's anything BUT anonymous.

"At the 1mb point around July/August, it was not appropriate to put off a block size increase until LN deployment, which still hasn't happened on December 21st (and *cannot* cover the network for months to years due to the requirement of each user opening multiple payment channels).  Congestion started hitting hard back around May, when average block size ran into the 1mb limit.

The damage caused by putting off a blocksize increase is substantially worse than anything avoided by  not raising it to 8mb or so.

"They never ""lied.""  They never explicitly said they wouldn't support it, they had just only committed to allowing withdrawals and hadn't yet committed to allowing buying/selling. They did say alts were coming. 
They also gave public indications that they were likely to support it eventually (e.g. on CNBC discussing their asset framework). It also seems like an obvious move after the failure of segwit2x. BCH was always the hedge against 2x failure.

You're also confused about what ""market manipulation"" means.  No, that's not what market manipulation means. ""Market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency.""

From a legal perspective, they have an obligation to disseminate material/market-moving non-public information fairly and broadly at one time. There are many possible ways to do this and they can choose when to do this and still be in compliance with the law. What you're describing is an issue related to ""insider trading"" not so much ""market manipulation.""

From a business perspective, by making the announcement *after* they actually have the ability to trade on their site, they prevent users from fleeing their service to trade on other exchanges.  If they had made an announcement a week ago, BCH trading activity (and fee revenue) would have skyrocketed on competing exchanges, and activity might have settled down by the time they made it available on their own exchange. Trying to avoid that scenario is competitive, but it's not in itself price/market manipulation nor insider trading. Coinbase as a business doesn't actually care much what the price of any asset is, their revenue depends primarily on trading activity.

People on the inside (employees) were prohibited from ""adjusting their positions"" in personal accounts and will be fired (and criminal charges possibly pressed) if it's determined that any of them violated that restriction. That would be a violation of insider trading rules. It's quite possible that some of these people, who likely don't have nearly as much compliance training as employees in traditional asset markets, did leak or at least hint at this information with friends (or traded on it themselves). That is a problem, and maybe coinbase could have better trained employees or considered this in their planning, but coinbase itself doesn't profit from this impact on price. It seems highly unlikely that coinbase the company is speculating on these assets and manipulating *price* to its benefit. They likely did all they could to prevent this from happening, and ""all they could"" just wasn't enough. That's not malicious in the way you people seem to think it is.

*IF* they are actually speculating on price internally, buying and/or holding BCH before making the announcement, that doesn't change the impact on price when making the announcement.  They could have announced a week ago and still made out on speculative illegal insider trading activity. The obvious explanation/motive for them choosing to announce at launch time is to capture the actual business activity created by them launching, not to try to speculate on the price impact of their announcement or help their employees break the law.

">If you only have one channel open, what economic constraints does that partner have on the fees they can charge? 

They can charge what they like. The constraint is market forces. If you open one channel with the intention of using that channel to route your payments into the network, and they raise their fees, you are likely to want to open a different channel, or multiple channels. So long as at least some participants in the lightning network don't try to artificially inflate fees in this way, then long term it shouldn't be a problem.

>At some point you're likely to scoff and exit the channel, but if the exit cost is high you're likely to pay the fee, especially if your payment is urgent.

Again, market forces. So long as some people use the lightning network in good faith (i.e. not all nodes engage in fee price fixing), then that reduces the on-chain transaction load, which will bring down on-chain fees, and this will always be an effective hard upper limit on LN fees, because if on-chain is cheaper, people will just use a regular on-chain transaction. But still, LN transaction relays will be in competition with each other, and the network will route via whatever path has the lowest fees. 

I think hub reputation will be a significant factor. Hubs that don't gouge on fees will be successful, those that do, won't. I for one, will be happy to route transactions with a fee that's enough to cover my running costs.

If most people are using the network primarily to send, their channels are going to be heavily weighted in one direction and of low utility for you in terms of balancing. To ensure sufficient capacity you would need to commit at least 2x the channel funding for partners on the edge. You may be able to get away with less, but risk being unable to service your channel partners' transactions. It seems reasonable that you (and everyone else) would want to charge higher fees to those types of channels. With high exit/commitment costs, there is a substantial level of lock-in, so while you may be in competition, it's not exactly a buyer's market.;1;1;False;tripledogdareya;drmg8vn;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

">And if 40 million? Thats 1 each,

Segwit/Schnoor/etc. make each transaction smaller, getting more per MB on the blocks. On LN, people can transact as much as they want and hardly ever settle to the blockchain.

It's been calculated that LN could handle 2 transactions each per day for all 7 billion people on Earth with an underlying block size of ~130MB. And that scale will not be needed for years, during which other problems could be solved, and efficiency improved.

Using LN *as intended* does not require a lot of on-chain transctions. You could theoretically be paid via LN/bitcoin, do the occasional transaction to top up your channel or transfer money to 'savings' (the blockchain). Regular users are more likely to keep a channel open, and use it indefinitely, topping it up when they run out of cash.

>Until I hear a concrete solution for the core devs regarding an immediate path forward I am not a fan of this coin

I can't disagree with that attitude. Bitcoin is currently unusable. I do believe the scaling will work in the long term, but if bitcoin fails because of the lack of short- and mid-term relief, then it's all for nothing. I'm definitely on the verge of quitting bitcoin.

">core weren't screaming that the sky is falling and threatening to split the network with a contentious hard fork.

Because they have their heads in the sand. Altcoins are providing users with functionality and usability they want that Bitcoin cannot provide. Even though Bitcoin had a huge first mover advantage. Fees are hurting Bitcoin adoption. 

Bringing up a block increase in order to buy more time to properly finish segwit and LN would not have destroyed the network. 

Segwit doesn't have adoption because it doesn't help the individual. Bitcoin protocol is about turning greed incentives into cooperation and trust. Without LN, segwit doesn't do that.

"@Bastiat

I personally think the next core release ought to adopt a rule among non-mining nodes that bars spending of any coinbase rewards unless they are spent to SegWit addresses.    Then put out a Bip to make SegWit mandatory for the network going forward, with lock in on 65% hash power.   Then set a flag day after which all transactions to non SegWit addresses will be unceremoniously evicted from the mempool. 

Those changes could be rolled out in a month.  It would immediately nearly double throughput and put the framework in place where Lightning is not delayed by lagging SegWit adoption.

Think about the typical use cases for transactions on such a network. As an individual, what are your normal money transactions? Buying things, paying bills, etc. That is, ignoring salary, your money tends to go one direction. All that is required for that is that you can reach the business or person via the network.

"Not everyone is required to route other people's transactions, so the unbalanced channels are not a problem for purchases who just want to send LN payments. 

For nodes/hubs that do offer to route payments, they will likely have multiple channels, and distribute their funds reserved for routing transactions evenly among them. It will be an implicit feature of the routing logic that routes will be chosen where the channel balance is sufficient to support to transaction in a particular direction. For a hub with many channels, this means that over time, whenever one of their channels becomes weighted too much in one direction, future transactions are more likely to be routed through those channels in the other direction.

"I'm actually really pissed about Segwit and the way it was implemented.  The Core team should have increased the blocksize to 2mb at the same time as implementing Segwit.

I understand the reasoning behind keeping the block size small and streamlined and all the benefits of Segwit, LN and other off-chain scaling solutions.  But these are still months away (and have been for months/years) and a 2mb block size is still pretty damn small.

Implementing Segwit isn't exactly an overnight development effort and exchanges that are passing fees down to users aren't exactly super incentivised to put forth that effort because it doesn't help them with anything.  As with anything, when it requires your users to change something on their end, they drag their feet getting it done unless it benefits them personally.

2mb blocks would instantly doubled transaction capacity and given the network some breathing room while exchanges converted over, and would have made an EXCELLENT short-term solution while we wait for the better, longer-term ones.";1;0;False;Mortimer452;drlv9wb;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

">It is much more likely that you will only connect to companies directly, in which case you're still gonna have to open a lot of channels.

No, not if LN has any decent amount of usage. The more people adopt bitcoin/LN, the more robust the network is. Even in the early days, if businesses/banks start using bitcoin, there will be a permanent network of businesses that you would be able to transact with through a single open channel. Add individuals and small businesses, and it should be practical for instant payment to almost anyone.

Best-cast scenario is opening a single channel semi-permanently (maybe 1 per year or less). Worst-case scenario is maybe opening a channel per week, which may or may not be good enough.

Also don't forget that LN relieves pressure on the blockchain, thus reducing blockchain fees, thus making it cheaper to open and close LN channels. Even if the number of channels needed per person is higher than expected, the cost for the associated blockchain transactions should still be a massive improvement in fees.";1;0;False;djgreedo;drlf7sg;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"It's expected that typical LN use will be more like opening a channel and leaving it open semi-permanently, so effectively doing all transactions in LN except for the occasional open/close.

The maths is simple: to transact 100 times via LN requires 2 on-chain transactions; to transact 100 times without LN requires 100 on-chain transactions. If people do more than 2 LN transactions per channel, there will be fewer on-chain transactions.

The whole point of LN is to take the bulk of transactions off the blockchain. Coupled with block size increases, LN can cater for orders of magnitude of scaling.

>We have a max of 146 million TX per year on the main chain.
>So 72 million total LN channels loaded and settled.
>If we have 20 million users of bitcoin. They get to do this 3x each max per year.

With segwit and Schnoor signatures the transaction size decreases, improving efficiency. The block size will have to increase at some point too. The alternative to using LN is of course that those 3 channel opens/closures would become 6 bitcoin transactions instead of effectively unlimited LN transactions.

"Bitcoin cash split from the bitcoin chain, so all historical transactions and wallets are valid in both btc and bch. There's parity between your two wallets. Any transactions after the split are only valid on the chain they're made on though.


If you had 5btc before the split, you then had 5btc and 5bch. If you then bought an extra 3btc after the split you'll have 8btc and 5bch still (only the btc chain increased, not the bch chain).

This is only the case if:

- You already had btc before the split

- you had your btc in a wallet that you own (exchange wallets only count if the exchange allows it)

Unbalanced channels are the biggest problem with send-heavy nodes. Their channels will nearly always be unbalanced - initially toward them when they top up, progressively toward you until they're depleted. In order for them to relay through you, you'll need to have an equal amount committed toward the rest of the network over multiple channels. The more edge send-heavy nodes you have connected to you, the more you must commit to ensure sufficient liquidity to support them. If they all get paid on Friday, you must have enough capacity from the rest of the network to support all of that inflow. If they all pay their rent on the first of each month, you have to have the outflow capacity to route that. If you don't maintain that capacity, they will be forced to either close their channel with you or commit new funds to open a channel with a competitor.;1;0;False;tripledogdareya;drmihim;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"First, this guide is great, much appreciated!

Thing is, the argument department is reading way too into things lately... 

I'm not with/against Coinbase, but development takes time - usually longer than estimated. Look at the AWS devs who mistakenly purged ALL US-East servers and brought 1/3 the US internet businesses down because of a forgotten flag in terminal cmd... would you rather they take time to do it well, or suddenly have one of the largest wallet systems crash and burn overnight? THAT would fuck with the price WAY more..

Their site front-end COULDN'T handle the spike in concurrent user sessions even when they announced it, is that ""intentional"" too? Displaying your ISP network Load Balancer error msgs? They clearly have technical debt they're quietly trying to deal with.. saying that shitshow of errors is intentional is nonsense.. they blocked buying AND selling of bcash on it probably because they have some fucked up part of it still.. (yes I know you can on gdax... but thinking they are literally the same server architecture is downright stupid, gdax came after if i'm not mistaken, maybe theres some tech debt in there thats fucking them sideways).

Sure, several places have implemented it ""in a day"" - but they probably aren't nearly as big as Coinbase. 1 mil vs 100 mil users is a HUGE difference in infrastructure concerns. If you have not directly worked on architecture with 100+ million users (let alone 500+ million), please stop screaming because the amount of technical debt that you combat as you grow that big that fast is astronomical... 

I'm not saying it wasn't playing into the bcash hands in some fashion, but dev work is fucking hard sometimes when you can't just start fresh with each new feature addition and you gain a million users or more a week if not a day... saying its all evil manipulation is just ignorant to how programming works sometimes..sure some is political bullshit, but its also part simply evolving an IN-PLACE SYSTEM with ZERO DOWNTIME..

Some devs think they know fucking everything and its so blindly arrogant. Yes, you probably made some amazing things in your career and scaled to the moon, but theres 5509420384 ways to build a web architecture and 239742934729374 ways it can fuck you into oblivion. If you are even remotely decent a dev to work with, you know not everything is done perfect.. and you work with challenges as you come. Aside from money I'd like to think its part of the reason people become developers on this shit.

But, something being legal isn't an endorsement of it being moral. It does tend to be used though by some who try to justify their behavior.

You keep missing my point.  If Bitcoin had, say, raised the blocksize so that a fee market never developed for blockspace, it would be as fast and cheap as BCH, and BCH would have no advantages to claim.  Litecoin is a more radical departure from Bitcoin than is Bitcoin Cash--changing the block time and the supply limit and the hash function were all significant changes.  Devs were trying to get Bitcoin to raise the blocksize limit for YEARS before the BCH fork.  If any one of those BIPs had been merged, there'd be no BCH.  And if a scaling proposal that worked without a block size increase had been completed instead, same difference.  Bitcoin's high fees and slow conf times are now a marketing attack vector for competitors.  Because BTC's capacity sucks, now every shitcoin out there is focusing on scalability.  This would not be the case if Bitcoin had adopted any scaling solutions.;1;0;False;;drlni3x;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

But unless they signed something they're under no obligation to not share it, in fact sharing is the moral thing to do here. The reason you believe sharing without permission is wrong is because you've been subjected to a lifetime of propaganda by the copyright industry.

The person or people who asked you to do the work. If nobody agreed to pay you to do it then why should you expect money for doing it?

> If you are using their product you have business with them.

I reject the notion that a copy of some produced works are the original product. The product is the product of their work, is the direct output of the ongoing process of creation. If I copy your works from a different person then you're no longer the one producing it; duplication is itself production, and it's extremely cheap.

> There is a world of difference between a friend showing you a video I made and you being able to create derivative works or feeling justified to downloading an entire TV series.

Only because the TV series was created with today's copyright paradigm in mind. If that didn't exist then there would be no real difference, and I'm arguing for an end to that paradigm.

> Yes big companies are pushing their own agenda and abusing the legal system to get extremely anti consumer extensions to copyright. 

I agree, and obviously choose my battles. I'm all for reducing copyright powers before outright abolishing it, but I still think it's an immoral system and part of the very reason it's bad is because it segregates people into ""producers"" and ""consumers"". These are marketing words that oppress society and undermine the creativity of all human beings in the name of maximizing profit.

> I completely agree but to argue that all copyright is immoral is ludicrous.

I've thought about this for rather a long time and while it may seem absurd given the history of our timeline, not having copyright is both the default and the moral stance. I'm not arguing for plagiarism, I'm arguing against state-sanctioned monopolies on culture in order to promote as close to full participation in creativity as possible. I'm not a die hard IP hater or an anarchist either, I support limited forms of trademarks, patents with limited scope and short durations, strong privacy law and weak trade secrets.

> I release a lot of open source code and participate in some larger open source projects (GPL, MIT mostly) but it is my choice to release works under these licenses.

Me too. I actually think that binaries are nothing but a loophole, exploiting the rules around derived works and shouldn't be covered by copyright law under our current system, and in an ideal world binaries without source would be banned as dangerous. If the source code isn't available then they can offer nothing in the copyright bargain, so why should we as a society offer them protection under the rules of that bargain?

Since nobody says this around here, I've enjoyed debating this with you.

Blocksize has no relationship whatsoever to difficulty (which is what demands processing power).  Neither bandwidth nor storage capacity are likely to be a problem, even with full 32mb blocks (which we're a loooong way from needing), and by the time we need gigablocks, we'll have figured out a good implementation for either sharding or zero-knowledge proofs of validity, or else we can implement node incentivization like so many other cryptos (Dash, ZCoin, ZenCash, etc.). There's also Graphene, subchains, block compression...  And if none of those are ready for deployment by then?  Well, then we can talk layer 2.  But denying basic block size increases NOW, when we are nowhere near blocksize causing difficulties, causing users to spend millions of dollars PER DAY on transaction fees (which just go to miners, and still leave tens of thousands of transactions stuck in the mempool) for an indefinite amount of time...how does that seem like the best course of action?;1;0;False;;drlnvrq;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

Ok, I got to make something clear to you. I love all people, including Chinese people. Chinese culture was part of my upbringing, and so was multiculturalism. I've been to a lot of places in the world, and people everywhere are clearly the same, and that is one of the strongest opinions I have, personally. The vast majority of people are wonderful. The distribution of assholes and asshats is consistent everywhere.  So you've really got the wrong idea here, somehow. Somehow you've pictured me as some alt-right white guy, which is kind of racist itself - but I can definitely understand why you'd think that. I've been on the receiving end of plenty of actual racism. I get it. But I remain firm:  when I say China, I mean the government, not the people. I detest nationalism of any kind. When I criticize China, as you've seen in my comments, I'm referring to the CPC. And you may be surprised to find out that I have a very negative perception of the US, politically. Please consider that you're a little over-sensitive to this racism idea. I know a lot of people feel the way I do, especially people in asia, and many CBCs as well. In fact, most of HK and Taiwan REALLY hate the CPC. That's not racist. And I have the same hate for the exact same reasons. I'm so saddened and disgusted, daily, by how much the CPC has destroyed Chinese dignity, culture, and standing. They are acting just as aggressively, nationalistically, and selfishly as the US did, as Japan did, as Germany did, as the colonials did. They are filling young people's mind with egregious amounts of hate, xenophobia, exceptionalism, and otherness mentality. I just don't understand how you are so supportive of them. I find it very alarming, in general, that criticism of China or the CPC is taken to mean criticism of the Chinese people. I really do hope that someday you will come to see that. I've been a reddit lurker for years. It's only after I've seen a very scary amount of pro-CPC and Russian shills and disinformation that I decided to speak-out more actively. So you're wrong to say I have so much anger, when in fact I have so much sadness for what is going on these days in the world. I'm filled with fear about the future of humanity.

Man, you really have a thing for this racism shtick. Like what happened to you? I'm pretty sure I could have a comment history full of cat pictures and you'd still say it was racist. Can you at least try to be more original? Anyone can just turn insults around, and pull the racism card.

"What exactly is broken about SHA-256 in the terms of a decentralization mechanism?

However, if you're point is that ASICs are breaking decentralization, then I totally agree with you. If our PoW was something more memory intensive, like scrypt, then yeah: totally.
