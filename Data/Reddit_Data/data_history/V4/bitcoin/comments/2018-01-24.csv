"Typical right-wing rhetoric.

I'm sure you think this is fine:

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has quietly dropped an investigation into a payday lender that contributed to Mick Mulvaney’s campaigns.

Mick Mulvaney is the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/cfpb-drops-investigation-payday-lender-contributed-mick-mulvaneys-campaigns?amp=1&amp;__twitter_impression=true

Embarrassing that you're on the side of payday lenders over the American public. But then again, you are a Trump supporter, so not too surprising.

Hmm... I wonder why this is:

>""The payday lending industry has aligned itself with Trump since the president's 2016 electoral victory. Advance America, the nation's largest payday lender, donated $250,000 to Trump's inauguration. Rod Aycox, a title loan executive, contributed $500,000; his wife kicked in another $500,000.""

>Mulvaney has received $57,100 in campaign contributions from the payday lending industry over the course of his political career, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. As head of the CFPB, Mulvaney is now in position to regulate the payday lending industry

I'm sure there's no conflict of interest that will encourage Mulvaney to lax regulations on payday lenders and other predatory scams. /s

Never said it was a legitimate or wise merit, just that it is one.

>Limited supply is not what makes anything a currency, currency is a medium of exchange, FIAT currency for instance, has no limit.

If fiat has no limit then lets just make as much money as we want, right? Then everyone'll be rich. It's unlimited after all.


>In the long-term we may unify to a world currency (this has been discussed, and the SDR has been proposed), but there are few reasons to have more than a couple cryptocoins that are traded. Tokens (as ownership) is a different story, but actual currency should unify to a peak technology (or a handful at best) once we really understand the path and use of digital currencies.

A universal currency isn't necessary with crypto. Currency will take on a different form with the advent of this technology. Businesses and companies will mint their own currency with the technology that is most suitable for them, and they'll incentivize people to use their currency in ways that'll benefit its economy.

No, because you only really need centralised exchanges to interact with *fiat* currency. Crypto to crypto can be done on smartcontract driven decentralised exchanges.

No they are not. An IOU is a debt note. Something anyone can issue, but only has value if you trust the issuer to honor his debt. A bitcoin is the exact opposite. It can not be issued based on debt, it can not be defaulted on.

"> Instantaneous transfers might be a selling point. Zero fees, too.

There is a new cryptocurrency on the scene that does exactly that. ([video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlD-LCPVunI)) Well ""instant"" defined as a few seconds. There's a couple others that are in that same ballpark and their fees are infinitely small. Bitcoin Lightning is also extremely fast and fees are tiny fractions of a penny. ([here's a demo on the test network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48uSd4eQfZs), but it is in beta on the live network right now) None of them are ready for prime time yet but they are all coming.

As far as counterparty risk, one defining feature of crypto is that transactions generally cannot be recalled once spent. So if you send Bitcoin to someone you cannot ""reverse the charge"" at a later date after receiving your goods and defraud the seller. This is the general rule across all cryptocurrencies. That is both a blessing and a curse, because if you type the address wrong, oops.

There are other methods as well in some systems. Smart contracts basically are a bit of code that run in the network (no servers -- literally it executes on machines worldwide effectively creating a global virtual machine) that enforces certain constraints. So you can commit funds to a contract with code that will then forward the funds to one or more parties when certain conditions are met, i.e. upon a certain date, or when an external system/sensor reports that some state has changed (external logistics system reports delivery of goods via API call, weather sensor reports weather change, etc).

Much simpler than smart contracts are basic multi-signature transactions. Bitcoin and some others support this. Basically you can have an M-of-N situation where you and I don't trust each other but we both trust Bob who has a reputation for acting as a trusted escrow-type agent. You can then send money using a transaction that requires 2 of the 3 of us to sign off on the final receipt of funds. You and I won't agree if one of us is trying to defraud the other, and Bob's reputation would be ruined if he committed fraud, so everyone has an incentive to be honest because if they aren't they stand to lose their funds.";0;0;False;doc_samson;dt6p1qq;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb
"See my other reply below; basically today crypto's are not a better universal payment system -yet. This will happen, see Lightening network to get a glimpse of the future, but if you have access to systems that work for you, and you need not fear a currency collapse or whatever, then there is no point yet. Crypto's are still too complicated and usually too slow, expensive and cumbersome to pay for groceries. If you want to transfer $1 million to a supplier in Taiwan or China, it could be a different story.

But you shouldnt judge crypto's based on that, anymore than you should have judged the internet based on its capabilities when we had a Gopher browser and 20 academic websites.   As a user, you might have done well ignoring internet back then, until it became useable and useful for normal people.

"If you live in a democratic country with a stable currency, there is no case to be made (yet) to use crypto for everyday purchases (edit: well, unless you value privacy!).

Mind you, this is only talking about the first application of decentralised blockchains: money. Money is an app, the simplest one. They can do so much more. Another easy to understand example is that one day, blockchains will replace stock exchanges. They are already replacing crowdfunding and VC funding. They are beginning to be used in supply chain management, property management, intellectual/digital right management,  and a bazillion other applications. We've barely scratched the surface. Think internet in 1992, and you're looking at a CLI email client wondering: whats the point? Faxing works fine.

Unit bias is the thinking newbs have like ""wow this altcoin is worth a penny each, what if it became a dollar someday?? $$$ ????""  So I'd give that kind of stupidity a bump.

So Ripple, premine, avoid..  bitcoin, rock solid, must be at least half of my setup. Privacy coins, my bueno. Monero = some kind of spanish sausage, very good.  Zcash 20% dev payout bleh, Zclassic looks better.  Dash staking scam. Steem junk. etc.

"> I hope you're 100% joking, you understand inflation right? Market supply is a property of currency - limiting the supply to a finite number does not make a currency. Do you live in the United States? Do you understand what quantitative easing is? America added $12 trillion to the money supply to ""stimulate"" the economy out of recession by lending the new money at 0% interest. That's about as far from limiting the money supply as you can get, and it's the worlds most powerful currency.

Woosh

>Why would people do this? Why would I want to have to buy and potentially hold all sorts of currencies just to inter-operate with other businesses? That's either a significant cost or an overwhelming hassle. You're just dreaming. A common currency simplifies our understanding in value.

Ok so there's this cool thing called AI, and mobile wallets. And get this, they handle all of it for you. So let's say you need some BONGO coins because you automatically get 5% BONGO coins back when you spend BONGO coins to buy a bongo. And you happen to have some McDonalds Coins from the reward you got for buying McDonalds a week ago, and the Bongo Coin to McDonalds Coin exchange rate is cheap today. Your wallet automatically figures this out and tells you it can get 1 bongo for just X amount of BONGO coins, or CAD, or YEN, or whatever the hell unit of currency you want it to show you, and it'll get X worth of rewards from X amount of companies and their affiliates. 

That all happens under the hood. All you tell your wallet is you want bongos, and it comes up with the cheapest, most profitable possible way for you to get them. Then it invests your rewards and gets you even more money.

Why would companies pay people to do something? Because paying people directly for their time and business is far more valuable than paying an ad agency, ad creator, publisher, and all the middlemen in between to advertise a product in the hopes of gaining the interest of non-interested people. And, when you create a token economy and reward people for beneficial actions correctly, and incentivize them to circulate the currency, your coin and your company value rises.

"It's a reckless market place for sure. You can make a coin popular based on an internet meme right now. A team is about to become ultra rich from the popular garlic bread meme.

I think the name ""cryptocurrency"" was either way to early or poorly chosen / adopted. Very few of the coins (again, bad name) are actually trying to be daily use fiat. To match fiat, they would have to be manipulatable in order to keep the price stable which doesn't match the basic premise. Price stability requires supply control and any coin that has supply control isn't decentralized (to me). Instead, in the broadest terms, I see them as more like a store of value for some coins and others, the coin price is the stock price of the marketplace solution the development team is trying to create in the background. The biggest issue to me is not ""if"" crypto will stick around, its more like will it be regulated a ton while the corporations catch up and create corporate blockchain solutions.

"All of what you described adds nothing to the economy.  Why would the music store give me 5% back in BONGO coins when I spend BONGO at their store?  That is just them taking a 5% cut on their sale, so where does that come from?  Do they just suck it up?  What did the store gain from me using BONGO coins?  Do they just invent BONGO coins out of thin air, sell them to the public on an exchange so the public can give them back to the music store for resale?  Isn't that exactly the same as using cash by adding an arbitrary middleman mechanism that adds no benefit?   Are you simply talking about a rewards program?  If so, rewards need to be offset by something that actually has value.  If not, then I don't understand how you think this improves upon simply having a common currency.  Do we all just arbitrarily buy and sell tokens for every imaginable thing based on the market supply and market demand?  Isn't that exactly what the current economy already does by using cash which doesn't imply the necessity of every company having their own token that performs no useful function?

You can distil your entire example down to a simplification:  Just one currency so that we don't have to do all that other dumb shit that create no value.

> Why would companies pay people to do something? Because paying people directly for their time and business is far more valuable than paying an ad agency, ad creator, publisher, and all the middlemen in between to advertise a product in the hopes of gaining the interest of non-interested people.

What?

So McDonald's will no longer have to advertise because they made McTokens?   Why not?  I don't know about their latest cheeseburger salad, how the hell are they going to tell me about it?  All those ""middle-man"" jobs aren't eliminated because you've added a token-layer to the economy, now they're just getting paid in tokens that McDonalds printed (what controls the rate at which they create them?), which is subject to the whim of the free market and may massively fluctuate in purchasing power based on decisions that McDonald's executives make - why should a worker be subjected to that?  Oh wait, they can exchange them, as you said, for something that has value to them, like say, Cash.

"When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with ""quantitative easing"" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.";3;1;False;olenbarus12;dt6nnwt;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"Planning and preparing for scale are an entirely different beast than actually having it.  I'm sure pokemon go devs prepared for it, but they had issues, along with tons of other companies with unexpected scale.  

Bitcoin has the most practice dealing with unexpected scale, and the biggest development team behind it (unarguably if you look at github stats).  

It also has the longest battle tested track record of not being hacked, overcoming attacks, and not to mention being the only coin you can short.  What would the price of some alts look like if it could be shorted?

All of the above is very very attractive to people with tons of wealth 500mm (who have no real reason to take risk), as well as institutional investors.  These type of people (who really drive price), don't invest in anything without a TON of due diligence.

>Why would the music store give me 5% back in BONGO coins when I spend BONGO at their store?

It's not the music store, it's the bongo company in this example. The music store gives you their own coins as a reward for buying from their stores.

>Do they just invent BONGO coins out of thin air, sell them to the public on an exchange so the public can give them back to the music store for resale?

Yep. Except it's wildly more profitable for the company and consumer.

> Isn't that exactly the same as using cash by adding an arbitrary middleman mechanism that adds no benefit?

Nope.

>Are you simply talking about a rewards program? 

Not like any rewards program that's been possible before.

>If so, rewards need to be offset by something that actually has value.

Yes, the company would make their token representative of something their company offers. That's what gives it value. It could also act like a stock and represent the company entirely.

>Do we all just arbitrarily buy and sell tokens for every imaginable thing based on the market supply and market demand?

We buy and sell based on what we think they're worth.

>Isn't that exactly what the current economy already does by using cash

Cash is a really roundabout way of doing simple trade. It isn't necessary anymore.

>Just one currency so that we don't have to do all that other dumb shit that create no value.

It allows us to take advantage of the value we create. You're creating value every time you're using a product or service. Every piece of your data and every second of your usage is valuable. 

>So McDonald's will no longer have to advertise because they made McTokens? Why not? I don't know about their latest cheeseburger salad, how the hell are they going to tell me about it?

The internet tends to get word around nowadays. Y'know, if somethings worth your time you usually end up hearing about it. But if you want to look at ads that bad, you can always turn them on and receive rewards for looking at them. Just another way to get money.

>All those ""middle-man"" jobs aren't eliminated because you've added a token-layer to the economy, now they're just getting paid in tokens that McDonalds printed

Never said they were eliminated, just that Mcdonalds doesn't have to use them anymore.

>(what controls the rate at which they create them?), which is subject to the whim of the free market and may massively fluctuate in purchasing power based on decisions that McDonald's executives make - why should a worker be subjected to that?

A predetermined automated algorithm. It's in everyone's best interest for the coin to rise. If the purchasing power goes to nill, the CEO's suffer just as much as the workers.

"> If fiat has no limit then lets just make as much money as we want, right? Then everyone'll be rich. It's unlimited after all.

I hope you're 100% joking, you understand inflation right?  Market supply is a property of currency - limiting the supply to a finite number does not make a currency.  Do you live in the United States?  Do you understand what quantitative easing is?  America added $12 trillion to the money supply to ""stimulate"" the economy out of recession by lending the new money at 0% interest.  That's about as far from limiting the money supply as you can get, and it's the worlds most powerful currency.

> A universal currency isn't necessary with crypto.

It's commonly understood that in global economics a common world currency is the next stage to international trade.  I don't see why we would improve on the current world currencies but fail at escalating this point.  There won't necessarily be one, but there definitely won't be many.

> Businesses and companies will mint their own currency with the technology that is most suitable for them, and they'll incentivize people to use their currency in ways that'll benefit its economy. 

Why would people do this?  Why would I want to have to buy and potentially hold all sorts of currencies just to inter-operate with other businesses?  That's either a significant cost or an overwhelming hassle.  You're just dreaming.  A common currency simplifies our understanding in value.  If I get paid $50 CAD (in my case) I know how much work went into getting that and I know what it's worth to me if I spend it.  If I have to buy 17 BONGO coins to do buy a drum from some music store, the BONGO coins are just an unnecessary step in the transaction when I really need to know the costs as it associates to my time-based earnings.

"Let's use an example.

Imagine if Bitcoin took over the world and is now the default currency for everyone. As Bitcoin has a public ledger, anyone can view any transaction that has ever happened.

A big corporation like Apple probably doesn't want you, the public to know how much they are spending buying goods and services from their suppliers, they'd like to keep that top secret so naturally they would want to use a currency that is private, secure and untraceable. That's where Monero can help.

It depends on how the regulatory marketplace sees it and shakes out. I used to be in the Anti Money Laundering industry and have friends in it still so I have also followed from that point of view. Our guess is that countries will eventually attempt to regulate the privacy coins somehow. It may better serve Bitcoin and Ethereum to stay potentially transparent, at least until adoption is more universal. My main point is, I don't think the privacy coins are going away in the next few years because that would broaden the already large target crypto has on its back.;2;1;False;Snaggletooth13;dt67mjq;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"Currency is a claim against goods and services, and thus *is* an IOU.  When you work for an employer, they give you money symbolizing that you have given them services which they value and thus for which they owe you something.  Whoever you are working for got those IOUs (presumably) from their customers, to whom they provided something of value. You can then go trade those IOUs with other people in exchange for something they have to offer which you value.

It used to be that currency was backed by gold.  In fact, that was kind of how paper currency originated, as an easier to carry claim on gold held somewhere safe.  That was an IOU too, because the note literally meant that whoever issued the note owed you and would repay on demand whatever gold was owed.

Currency doesn't have any actual value itself, aside from the value it provides as a medium of exchange.   The paper and ink of a note have very little worth in themselves, the value comes from the social convention assigned.  This is also true of Bitcoin - the individual bits, even the hash itself has almost no intrinsic worth.  Proof of work is a sunk cost and doesn't give the numbers value.  The fact that people value it for whatever they value it for is what gives it worth.";-1;2;False;actual_factual_bear;dt69su2;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"No offense, but I have been around the block, and have a pretty good grasp of how bitcoin works, no need for that video. 

What you are doing is confusing bitcoin with the dollar value of that bitcoin. Thats why you think its an ""IOU"" or intangible. But thats just wrong. In ancient times they used seashells as money. It had no intrinsic value. But it was an asset, not an IOU. If instead they used clay tablets to keep track of payments, then you have an IOU. The tablet may say I owe you 2 sheep, but I might not have them.

Bitcoin is just like the seashell, its  absolutely an asset, not an IOU. There is no debt involved, no promise. You might have an expectation of value, but thats your problem, not bitcoins. 1BTC=1BTC and there is no way to default on that. 

Unless that bitcoin is stored on an exchange. Then the exchange has the bitcoin, and issues you an IOU, in the form of a bitcoin balance on their website. Thats a debt. Thats a counterparty risk. If the exchange gets hacked, you 'll never see your bitcoin. But if you own the private key, there is no way to default on a bitcoin payment.

"It doesnt have to be. In bitcoin, there is a need for a native token (also called bitcoin), as an incentive for miners to spend electricity to keep the network secure. Its also needed as a cost to prevent network spam (doing a transaction costs some millibtc). If transactions are free, then its easy to spam the network to the point where it no longer works. To be an open, trustless blockchain, bitcoin needs incentives and disincentives, and thats accomplished with a native token.

Less decentralised blockchains that do not have similar game theory proof incentives, can work without a token. The price you pay for that, is that it requires trust among the users of the system, or at least trust in the ones maintaining the ledger. This is more database like than bitcoin like though, but the upside is that generally you get a system that is far more scalable. This can be a perfectly acceptable compromise in some situations.

">Paper dollars are close to perfectly anonymous once they're mixed into circulation.

Sure. But paper dollars only work when you trade with someone locally. They are pretty useless on the internet. And paper money is soon a thing of the past; governments all over the world are severely restricting cash, and it wont be long before its banned outright. Also note, that paper money is one the few ways we still have to do P2P value transfers without trusted third party. If bitcoin is described as an ""electronic cash"" system, its because it shares most of its attributes with paper cash, rather than electronic fiat.

">even the hash itself has almost no intrinsic worth.

Nothing has intrinsic worth. Everything has relative and subjective worth. Gold has value to the extent that it serves industrial purposes and its capacity to serve as a immutable and limited standard for recording value. If cryptos prove to be a better standard for storing value, then cryptos will be relatively BETTER than gold at storing value. Intrinsic value is meaningless. 

Cockroaches are intrinsically valuable as a food, but are relatively worthless by comparison to other foods. But if you're stranded in a cave and the only food around you in cockroaches, then cockroaches become incredibly valuable as food. Its all about context.

>That(Gold certificates) was an IOU too, because the note literally meant that whoever issued the note owed you and would repay on demand whatever gold was owed.

This is very different from fiat currency. An IOU for a specified amount of gold is not the same as a piece of paper with a completely indeterminate value and no guarantee of worth. 

>Currency doesn't have any actual value itself

Yes it does. The value is the capacity to trade and create more net wealth as a result. Without currency, there would be less wealth. Currency has value to the extent of the wealth it creates. If a currency is so poorly managed such that it rapidly loses its purchasing power, then its desired use (value) will cease to exist.

"Doesn't mean that he's not in his own little bubble. You see that a lot with people who are highly specialized in their field. Their life surrounds something, so that something is inherently more valuable to them. 

The truth is that all currency, including crypto relies on trust in the currency itself. Gold is valuable because we have a long history of ""knowing"" gold is valuable, in reality most of the traits humanity first sought in gold aren't as important in today's society. It's scarcity and it's historical significance has enabled it to be an easy near universal currency.  When we looks at how fast we make technological leaps compared to how old we have   invested with things like gold, I find it hard to believe that crypto will ever be as trusted. The ability for tech to outpace the foundations of currency is too risky for long term money management.

I still think bitcoin wins to whatever degree that is.  Wall Street talks about diluting the value of Bitcoin by all these other coins, which happens to a small degree I think, but I in the end all the other coins get diluted because there's too many to discern and Bitcoin only has 21 million.

Satoshi left behind 1 million coins in beginning of Bitcoin, or about $10 Billion assuming 1 BTC = $10k.  It seems reasonable to assume that these coins act as a prize encouraging people to find a flaw in Bitcoin because a $10 Billion payout is worth the trouble.

"The difference between fiat and (most) crypto's is not the finite supply, thats just a property you can choose for either system.  The difference is that crypto's are not IOUs. 

Before bitcoin, the only way to transact something of value electronically was using a trusted third party with a database. That database would record who owns what to whom. This is as true for (digital) money as it is for stocks, or property.  Thats why we need banks and stock exchanges/brokers and notaries.  The problem with this approach? The middleman (who has control and can charge fees) and counterparty risk, as anything in that database is by definition an IOU.

With crypto currencies, a database record does not refer to something of value (IOU), it *is* the thing of value (asset). Its like an electronic bearer bond. Therefore you can transact peer 2 peer, without third party, without counterparty risk. Thats what this is all about.

As for infinite inflation due to infinite number of coins; that only true if these new coins gain infinite value.  The value of most token scales with the number of users. Their security scales with their value.

"Dude why tf are people including woz having such a hard time understading basic economics? You need a currency that has a 2% inflation/year if you want people to spend it. What matters is TRADE, as much trade as possible brings the econnomy up. BUY, SELL, DO SHIT. Just don't think about the money and it all seems like people are doing favors to eachother for free. Well, not exactly free, but money is a measure of one's worth(time, energy, work done, etc), So the more worth you have the more you can have people do for you.

If your currency goes up 10,000% in a year, then 50% in a single day, people are gonna shit their heads. Econnomy would stall. People would hoard the currency(in this case btc) and you'd end up with exchanging bottle caps as the new ""de facto"" currency because you need money to be COMMON and EASY TO OBTAIN too.

Bitcoin is a pain in the ass to get a hold on. First of all it costs a lot, then it's limmited in supply and thats A BAD THING. Why? Cause the first to have come to the table will get rich as fuck, the last ones will work for mere satoshis/month. Think of it in the year 2100 where 7bln people all use btc let's say, you'd have a big chunk of it being exchanged between rich folk and the poor would battle for the scraps. And right now you need wallets, cold storage, bullshit wallet adresses with 20 catchphrase passwords, you think people have time for that?

And there's nothing UNIQUE about btc or any other crypto currency for that matter. They can be replicated.

Why use one of 100,000 cryptos in the year 2100 when I can just make my own and hype the shit out of it for easy profits? This can't go on indefinitely. It's a bubble and it will crash, hard.

The only realistic scenario is one where corporations such as google facebook, banks, start issuing their own cryptos, offering it to stock investors, perhaps being interchangeable with company stock too, making it as easy to use for the regular folk as credit cards or cash. And it likely will happen, because state sovereignty is a thing of the past now, and the corporations hold the reigns of power, and the cherry on top will be to issue their own money, pay their customers and employees on their own terms, not the state's. And they will push it successfully because they have the marketing capital for it. Bitcoin is a free for all game, each to his own. Centralised organisations have an advantage here.";2;1;False;hitchinvertigo;dt6k96e;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

Bitcoin is today’s brand leader in blockchain that most people have actually heard of. It is like IBM was to computer or Hoover was to vacuum cleaner in the past. This doesn’t mean it will be most widely used type of crypto currency in the future.

"Bitcoin and gold are like brothers.  Neither is ""better"" than the other, they're different and they compliment each other very nicely.  You don't have to choose.  If you're invested 100% in either you're making a mistake.  If you have one without the other, you're putting yourself at needless risk.

That having been said, USD is not an investment.  It's also a speculation, in a sense...  but it's a depreciating asset because it can be printed with impunity and without end.  Gold and Bitcoin are limited to what can be extracted, given a certain capital/energy outlay.  

Until war comes, of course, then the USD will appreciate somewhat because you can count on the yanks to make good on their promises.

"I think its best to view it as two different layers. The ""infinite"" layer that you're describing here is the actual underlying technology. Its the ability to create a secure, distributed ledger.

On top of that ""infinite"" layer, is the finite layer, which is bitcoin, litecoin, whatevercoin, etc. The finite aspect comes from the usability of each different coin. Bitcoin is a finite supply, and to gain access to bitcoin's uses you need to use bitcoin, you can't use another coin. This includes the markets where bitcoin is valued, and is able to be used as a medium for exchange. I could create a fork of bitcoin which has the same access to that underlying ""infinite"" layer, but the finite layer where bitcoin exists is lost to me, and anyone who would like to use my forked coin.

Shared databases for the world are new and exciting and we will continue to see more money dumped into altcoins provided that those altcoins have a useful shared database.

"Some of what you are saying is correct, but as someone else wrote, you are misunderstanding some key points.

The public trust in bitcoin does give it value.  What excited me about bitcoin was the fact that it was stateless money, which couldn't be shut down by any government or large institution.  I also loved the technical properties and when I began investing the fees were lower.  Those fees, even then, were not lower (for me) than credit cards or cash though... that was never the main value driver.  Security and decentralization are paramount.

No centralized project, regardless of the tech properties, can replace bitcoin as a new form of stateless money.  It will be nearly impossible to recreate the genesis story and get to this point with a new tech.  Even though many products work toward decentralization, it is very hard to achieve enough to really be hardened against government action.  If a handful of people being put in jail would dramatically affect the project, it's not awesome as decentralized sound money.

I'm not against other crypto for other purposes.  I am cheering for the entire space.  But it is extremely likely that these cryptos will be priced in bitcoin and bitcoin will be around long term as a value store at the very least for people who value security and decentralization above all (and there are many).";3;1;False;xxDan_Evansxx;dt5u6b3;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

Please understand that what makes Bitcoin so valuable in the first place is its decentralisation and censorship-resistance.

"Serious answer: There is an infinitely varying supply of Monopoly money and skeeball tokens and plastic toy tokens but they aren't adopted as currency by anyone. Why is that? Because nobody trusts that the *next* person will accept it as currency. That's it.

One thing that is obscuring outsiders' perception of the cryptocurrency market is that very few of the coins on there are actually designed to be *currencies* at all. Many of course are simple pump-and-dump scams foisted on unsuspecting people, while others are used as a vehicle to raise money for various projects in lieu of a regulated stock IPO. Neither of those is realistically a viable option for currency or anything else going forward, but we are in the 1997 phase of the dot-com boom so there are tons of batshit crazy ideas being thrown out to see what sticks to the wall. Over time most will die out just like Pets.com and Altavista.

However, a significant number of the coins are platforms providing features like automated smart contracts and even paying a form of ""dividends"" daily to coin holders. They *can* be used as currencies but they can *also* be used as platforms on which to build other applications and services.

So think of it as buying pieces of Google's APIs and then being able to trade some of those pieces for a cup of coffee or a piece of land or for someone else's barrel of oil. That's the best analogy I can think of offhand. Because coins are *kind of* like currencies and *kind of* like stocks and *kind of* like bonds and *kind of* like precious metals but they aren't *exactly* like any of them.

a very successful trader once said if you diversify, all you do is hedging against ignorance. the better strategy is to do research and then pick very few assets with solid fundamentals, you will find out the fundamentals of ETH are totally broken and a pipe-dream, so are most of altcoins, while BTC is solid a.f. if you want to hedge crypto, maybe not against ignorance but against unknown bugs and hidden flaws, then do so with USD, stocks, and gold, but not with other cryptos. buy other cryptos if you outright want to gamble, but then you could also margin trade BTC, it nets you the same.;6;7;False;;dt617x9;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb
"The only one that has been around for years is Bitcoin - Guess which one is more likely to be around in another 10 years? Bitcoin

I mean everything is so new right now, but eventually i think people will settle on a single currency just because its more convenient. I honestly think BTC is the best contender because of its decentralized and censorship resistant nature - Its also a very honest digital currency it doesent lie about scalability issues like ETH and Bcash for example does. These coins could disappear in the near future because they became victim of not taking scaling issues serious. Bitcoin will always be the digital gold and thus the foundation of digital money.";1;0;False;brewsterf;dt6p7q7;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"> I am struggling to understand about the value of digital currency.
>[...]
>This switching between an endless creation of ""finite supply currencies"" effectively means digital currencies as a group are infinite in money supply and as a group they become a fiat currency.

You are completely right.  Digital currency poses a good threat against the world monetary system, but nobody can know which one, if any one, will emerge as the dominant standard.  Anyone who claims otherwise is either ignorant or lying.

Bitcoin has nothing going for it other than being first.  There are other clever coins that do add on what Bitcoin is lacking.  Bitcoin could also change to add these missing features in the future.  It's a wide open field and there is no objective way to measure the long term value of a coin.

That being said, I'm glad these crypto-currencies are emerging to offer a real threat to fiat currency.  I personally am staying vested in fiat currency, but I'm glad something is threatening competition to fiat currency to ""keep it honest"".

"You can't conflate the value of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with that of their competitors. It really doesn't matter how many new cryptocurrency projects come out, especially since Bitcoin is the first mover and is likely to dominate the space. Assuming something like Dogecoin is around 5 years from now, you would have a hard time finding someone willing to accept it as payment.

As a result, they don't *collectively* become a fiat currency. I would agree that strictly monetary blockchains like Bitcoin would be a form of fiat currency (or better yet, they could be described as a highly liquid commodity), even one with several distinct disadvantages. Insofar as you consider a ""currency"" as something that functions as (1) a unit of account, (2) a store of value, and (3) a medium of exchange, I would argue that Bitcoin functions poorly for (1) and (2), since its value is vulnerable to wild market fluctuations (although this may be moderated in the future). The value-add comes in the form of (3), because it removes the need for an intermediate bank in a whole range of transaction types, especially wire transfers.

This isn't even considering other highly innovative coins that function as platforms for smart contracts and dapps, which facilitate (3) to an extent much more difficult in the world of traditional paper currencies, in addition to offering potential for a wide range of non-monetary uses.

Also consider something like gold, the value of which is almost completely based off of perception. Intrinsic uses for it have only been developed somewhat recently, and its enduring value over time shows that ""fiat"" currencies don't have as big a fundamental weakness as everyone tends to assume.

TL;DR Cryptocurrencies fill a very important niche as a medium of exchange and beyond, and this is their basic value-add. The value of major cryptocurrencies should not be conflated with that of the legions of shitcoins.";1;0;False;eth_rogen;dt5ysb1;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"Very good point. The best players exercise control of their bankroll- and most importantly- can play thier best without resorting to ‘nothing to lose’ tactics.

 Story I heard from a friend who lived in Las Vegas is that lots of the household names of poker that we knew in the mid-2000s started to go on a bad run when online poker rooms like fulltilt got busted and the sponsorship money dried up for these players. Lots of big names who used to frequent  Las Vegas poker rooms started to go on bad runs because suddenly the money that they were losing at the tables was there actual real life bank roll. Before that time the big names would play recklessly at the tables and use the knowledge that a big paycheck was coming every month to gain a huge psychological edge on their opponents.  Among those people are guys who were household names just 10 years ago and were considered undisputedly some of the best players in the game. So yeah a lot of this comes down to managing bank role in managing bad runs. It will be interesting to look back in another 10 years to see how the Phil Ivys of the world are doing.

I think the take away from this is that some of our early poker stars were just guys who were OK at the game and got lucky going on a huge run and cashing huge add a major tournament.

3. Because transaction confirmation speed demand will increase faster than disk write speed.

"> likely coming to an end in the next few years

says in literally the first article you linked that this statement is untrue, quote: 

""However, the ITRS believes this does not mean the end of the concept behind Moore's Law, as manufacturers find increasingly innovative ways to squeeze more switches into a given space. Take 3D NAND, for example, the idea of stacking sets of transistors on top of each other to create ""3D processors"".

>Maybe if you studied computer science and/or physics

Not that it's relevant because this subject matter is so surface-level, but I did actually study software engineering and applied physics at a respected Technology university in my country Australia. 

>blindly fo to BCH advocates who have a conflict-of-interest when they talk about cryptocurrency

I don't blindly follow anyone, in fact I typically do code analysis myself on the different blockchain projects that interest me.

">Lots of gamers are complaining that GPUs are now expensive because of crypto mining. 

Lucky the mining algorithm we're discussing is most efficient on the custom-built ASIC architecture, not gaming GPUs

>What do you think will happen to storage costs when there’s a huge demand on storage due to adoption? 

The impact on storage costs against the whole market will be close to zero. The increases we are discussing here are insignificant when compared to the storage industries capacity at large.

"Is it? You rebuttal addresses only one of the two points I made. But ok, I'll bite.

Type into Google ""Proof of Moore's Law"", and you will find that:

1. ""Moore's law refers to an **observation** made by Intel co-founder **Gordon Moore** in 1965."" and is ""**not a physical or natural law**.""
2. ""Although the rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012, the rate was faster during the first decade."" and ""in 2015 **Gordon Moore** foresaw that the rate of progress would reach saturation"".

I.e. Moore's Law is an observation of the trend at the time, not something that was proven to continue into the future. And **the guy who made the original observation, now observes that it's slowing down**. If you Google further, we can see a consensus that Moore's Law is likely coming to an **end in the next few years**:

1. ""Intel's former chief architect Bob Colwell recently said that Moore's law will be dead within a decade. Colwell predicted that the maximum extension of the law, in which transistor densities continue doubling every 18-24 months, will be hit in 2020 or 2022, around 7nm or 5nm.""
