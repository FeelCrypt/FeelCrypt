The whole point of a bankruptcy is that it freezes debt at the point that the bankruptcy process started. So for instance, MtGox was insolvent and all withdraws were halted well before they declared bankruptcy, all creditors get additional delay damages on top of their claim because of that up until the bankruptcy process started. This is also why when filing claims the trustee valued BTC at the price it had when the bankruptcy started and not when the claim was filed.

Why shouldn't the debtor have to pay out whatever minimum liability and in the event appreciation exceeds this amount that excess goes to the owners whose equity created those gains. 

It makes no sense for Mark to profit massively by declaring bankruptcy. This creates a terrible precedent for freerolling a customer when in custody of a highly speculative asset. 

Mark essentially exit scams and has to declare bankruptcy. Instead of having to pay out everything he gets to wait years to see how the remaining assets appreciate.

"He is a crooked seller. If he was a good seller he would have sold trough an auction, like he was advised and what the standard strategy is in these cases. 

He didnt do that, he sold on the market, why would he do that?

**Option 1:** He had no strategy and panicked when the price went down and wanted to secure the funds to pay back the claimed fiat. This would show incompetence, he was very much the reason the price went down. 
This is a guy with a good financial background, its hard for me to imagine he is a complete moron in managing funds, he got the job because people though he was competent.

**Option 2:** This guy sees the chance to make some sweet money, he informs his friends when he is making the sales and they short the market with leverage. He gets his cut in XMR and is probably celebrating with coke and hookers as we speak.

He didn't sell over a 3 month period evenly.  He sold in bursts, and didn't even spread it around to different exchanges.  Let's take GDAX, if you had 13k bitcoins that you wanted to sell RIGHT NOW, all in one large batch, you would drive the order book down to $2,600.  You'd cause a panic that would tank the price on other exchanges.  If you then waited a month, and suddenly put 13k out there all on the same day and exchange you'd cause the same thing again.  This goes for high value, low share count stocks too - if I suddenly decided to put 1,000 share of BRK-A up for sale at market price all in 1 go, the price would absolutely nosedive.

Clearly this guy dumped a lot of BTC. Let's put aside whether he should have done something else and the law behind all of it. The consensus is his selling crashed the market? Or was simply a part of the decline?

Does anyone have any numbers to reflect the decline with his selling? Not just a chart correlating with a decline. Can anyone show exactly how much the price dropped when his order went through? I guess my thought is, how much would his sell alone actually change a >100b mcap market.

I'm trying to get the cold, hard facts of it instead of the possibility people just want to pin everything on him to make themselves feel better. Is there any decent source that says: when X amount of BTC is sold the price will go down Y amount?

"Each individual creditor should have initially been given the choice as to how they wanted to be reimbursed either in bitcoins or fiat or a mixture of the two.

Furthermore, shouldn't the creditors be the beneficiaries of Bitcoin's price appreciation. Who will profit now? Who is more entitled to the remaining wealth than the creditors?

"Lol someone 20k coins and moved the market by 60% and you think there is actual liquidity.  

What happens when the satoshi block, which holds what, 5% of the total supply, decides to sell 20% of that?  The price will crater by 90%+.";2;1;False;newprofile15;dvcju4j;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/
"The selling in BTC might be nearly complete if these numbers are correct.
Settlement = 45.6B JPY or $430M USD.
To raise that amount trustee would need to sell about 43k BTC coins at $10k/coin.
Average closing price since 9/27/17 = $9950 +/- couple hundred bucks.
Would mean a lot less supply which had to be liquidated.";1;0;False;zxr611;dve68q4;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/
But as an individual, you can buy bitcoin.

"Ok point taken, but isn't maximizing value always a concern? Even if you're just a trustee.. And why did they choose this point to sell instead of 6 months ago or a year ago?

Another thing is, that would mean they aren't actually trying to ""crash the market"" right? Because as a trustee, he has nothing to gain (or lose) by doing so, if they are neutral and just trying to pay back.

Also, just logistically speaking, how do you entrust 200k bitcoins to a trustee? I mean having the private key to that account (or accounts) means that he can steal it for himself no? Or do they have some sort of system where the private key isn't accessible to an individual (or even a few individuals collectively) ";1;0;False;abedfilms;dvcsr6i;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/

I believe the Trustee is only obligated to sell enough assets to cover the credtors, which is only about 1/20th of the BTC holdings, so this may not be as bad as it potentially looks.;1;0;False;bell2366;dveahzi;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/
