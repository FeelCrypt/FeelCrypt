It's changed a lot, shows how little you pay attention to the development.

Neither of which are bitcoin, we're in the bitcoin subreddit.

"Dude do yourself a favor, build a proper diversified investment portfolio. Your hodl should never cause you to panic. You need to separate your long term belief in it from the price action which is basically Wall Street's plaything right now. Never seeing 3k again is perhaps more likely than not but far from off the table. 

Even if it continues to rise, upside potential decreases with every run, meaning where some early adopters may have easily 100x their position, buying today we'd be very lucky to 10x. So hodling today is more risk, less reward. There will most likely never be more bitcoin-made millionaires than there are now.

Guys, I‚Äôve been watching it flucuate between 12K and just under 10K. It‚Äôs a marginal increase/decrease in the grand sceme of things. If I see a hike of over or under 5K that‚Äôs when I get concerned. I logged in this morning and saw it was below 10K and had a mini panick attack as I have a lot inveseted in this crypto. It wasn‚Äôt even 3 hours later that I was seeing it back at a stable 10K +/- hundreds USD. Once I see it going below 9k I may start to become concerned. As of right now it just seems like standard market flucuation. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here but I‚Äôm just not seeing why everyone is having a fit over what looks like _standard_ market flucuation. Also, please enlighten me if this is the most aassinine take on what‚Äôs happening regarding the recent trends in BTC movement.;2;1;False;__THE_RED_BULL__;eusnfdf;Quick, upvote this to confuse everyone into thinking the price jumped back up.;chbx9d;https://i.redd.it/pcioshemnac31.gif
