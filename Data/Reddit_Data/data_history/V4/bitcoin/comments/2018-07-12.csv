This is insanely true on my part as well and would be surprised and impressed if anyone is doing better holding alts over bitcoin.

Yup yup and if anyone here is in tech, you'd know how many companies are running to join this ASAP. Everyone is trying to get in on some level, including major corporations.

Oooo, I remember those days. I lost 1,000 BTC to the Mt. Gox breach. It was before I understood that exchanges could get fucked. Tough lesson to learn and I didn't buy any crypto for a couple years because of that burn. That was crazy back then. I remember buying at $3.5 originally, even cheaper sometimes, when I first started. It's so bizarre to see the current price.;1;1;False;Middle_Ground_Man;e28qvj8;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png
Your right that no one can predict it but buying into anything that has just went up 20x in a year is just bad investing.  Your setting yourself up for huge losses, you need to anticipate that there will be a downside after a bull run like that.  ;1;0;False;MX72;e28zxgd;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png

"Not really...

Transactions occur when demand and supply intersect. Those intersections determine price.

The price of a market with zero supply is equal to the bid price with an asterix (a comment that the true price is uncertain and likely higher).

The price of a market with zero demand is equal to the put price with an asterix (a comment that the true price is uncertain and likely higher).

Both scenarios you suggested aren't just impractical, they're impossible as nothing can be practically worthless and still have a market, and nothing can be practically infinitely valuable.

If it was true you'd be able to make any unique item infinitely valuable simply by trading it once and then refusing to trade it ever again.

The longer a market goes without any demand supply interactions (and thus transactions) the larger the uncertainty about price becomes up to the point where a market no longer exists.";1;0;False;terrificsmith;e28khy9;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png
