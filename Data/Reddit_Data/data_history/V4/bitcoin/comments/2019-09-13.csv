"Yes, Macron is a pos. Look at the continued yellow vest protests still after months.

""Many protesters say their purchasing power has dwindled so much over the years that today they have [trouble making ends meet](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/europe/france-yellow-vest-protests.html?module=inline) — let alone coming up with money for simple outings, vacations or even just to go out to dinner once in a while. Many are earning close to the median income, but costs have risen and pay has not.

The median earner in 2016 in France took home about 1,700 euros ($1,930) a month, but that means that half of the French took home less. The income has to cover rent, food, utilities and clothing, as well as the cost of fuel.""

Of course they can, but the logic of the argument is contradictory: that object category is worthless to me, so I will not endorse its distribution nor its attribution of value in commercial relations, but, as soon as it generates revenue for you (thus affirming its value), it becomes a valuable possession that I can gain from through taxes. It's like I said you cannot use your money as collateral for a contract, even though I consider its worth in some situations. The situation creates a disadvantage for you: your digital money isn't really money, but it is taxable as every other object that holds fiat currency value.;13;1;False;hfmed;f03ljjq;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg

Correct in my opinion.
Further, the value in relation to fiat fluctuates too much, whereas interest rates etc are rather stable. 
What we should be focusing on what will give BTC the most immediate value, which in my opinion is more people with some, so they can start to look for ways to use it...as quickly and easily and ubiquitously as they currently do with credit and debit.

Bitcoin is great, but how many people actually got in in 2009 and didn't lose their keys ? Very few, so most of its meteoric rise is spilled milk to the average redditor, also you could pick any of thousands of alts that are down 70 - 99 % over shorter periods, with no sign of coming back. I think its pretty clear WHY governments worry about crypto, and its not the loss of financial sovereignty, at least not for any of them but Libra. The truth is, governments are worried about people getting scammed out of all of their money, because they don't want to deal with upset constituents. Its pretty clear from congressional testimony about Libra that Bitcoin or alts don't worry governments at all, unless they fail or are scams.;1;0;False;HODL_monk;f04qign;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg
