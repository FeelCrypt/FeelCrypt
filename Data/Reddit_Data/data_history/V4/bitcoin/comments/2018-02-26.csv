"> The planet has 130% of the gravity on earth but is football shaped and moves 99.9% of the speed of light.

This part always stumps me.

99.9% the speed of light relative to what? Earth? If that's the case then Earth is moving 99.9% the speed of light relative to Miller's planet. 

I would love for someone to explain this to me because speed is all relative to me. I never understand why time is different between observers if they are both moving relative to each other, equally. Baffled me for years and years now. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But the time dilation only occurs when on the surface of the planet, not when in orbit of either the planet or the black hole. The guy on the ship ages while they are on the surface of miller's planet even though he is also orbiting the black hole.

"In general, everything is moving away from everything else. However, relative to any specific galaxy, nothing is moving faster than C. Also, not every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy. In fact, our Milky Way is on course to [collide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision) with the Andromeda galaxy.  
&nbsp;  
Maybe you're thinking of something [like this](https://phys.org/news/2015-10-galaxies-faster.html), where the excessive speed is something of an illusion. As the galaxies travel through space, the space they just traveled through expands. If you don't account for the expansion, this makes it appear as if the galaxy traveled a bit further than it actually had and, thus, was traveling faster than it actually was.  
&nbsp;  
Another way to think of it: Measure the distance between us and another galaxy to get D^^1. Wait a bit and then measure again for D^^2. Normally, D^^2 - D^^1 would give a distance to calculate the speed of that galaxy. However, you're also including all of that space between us and that galaxy in the equation. In the time between measurements, all of the space between us and that galaxy has grown and makes D^^2 larger than it should be.";5;1;False;Skipachu;duupz5m;It would be so easy then;80bdfo;https://i.redd.it/61sl8stbjii01.jpg

"**Andromeda–Milky Way collision**

The Andromeda–Milky Way collision is a galactic collision predicted to occur in about 4 billion years between the two largest galaxies in the Local Group—the Milky Way (which contains the Solar System and Earth) and the Andromeda Galaxy. The stars involved are sufficiently far apart that it is improbable that any of them will individually collide. Some stars will be ejected from the resulting galaxy, nicknamed Milkomeda or Milkdromeda.

There is no 'absolute' speed.  A frame of reference is required to measure distance, speed, etc.  Due to the messed up rules of high-speed travel, although it can appear as though two objects are travelling away from each other at up to nearly 2 times the speed of light, from the point of view of either of those objects, they will only be travelling at almost the speed of light away from each other.;1;0;False;SparroHawc;duv4ey1;It would be so easy then;80bdfo;https://i.redd.it/61sl8stbjii01.jpg

Yeah that's not really how orbits work though , is it? As you approach a massive object you have to reach the speed required to enter orbit at a given distance to the object.
