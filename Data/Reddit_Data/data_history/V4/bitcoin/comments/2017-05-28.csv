"Satoshi Nakamoto was the original creator of bitcoin, and author of the whitepaper. He successfully remained anonymous throughout Bitcoin's early development, and so nobody knows who he/she/they really are. He was thought to be Japanese, but nobody really knows where in the world he came from or where he went.

There's possibly two reasons he disappeared;

1) being the creator he must have thought he would have an undue amount of influence and didn't want to become a leader since that would run counter to his goal of a decentralized currency.

2) he expected that being the inventor of the first widely successful cryptocurrency (there have been other attempts before), he would be a target of government coercion or attacks, much like the inventor of PGP encrypted email was.

There are other theories, such as Satoshi dying or becoming a political prisoner in his country. None of these can be discounted, but I choose to believe that Satoshi is simply in hiding, and may not even be directly involved in Bitcoin anymore.

In the past, there has been people who have been 'outed' as Satoshi, though not with any real proof. There's also been people who have claimed to be Satoshi, though not with any real proof. The Satoshi Nakamoto story is a pretty good one, but you should be extremely skeptical of any claims since there are no good motives for anyone wanting to be Satoshi.";16;2;False;strips_of_serengeti;di5b4my;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

Let's not forget that the word 'centralization' and 'decentralization' come from how modern FIAT is controlled by banks by having control of the ledger, and by decentralizing control of the ledger you have have a currency where people can send money directly to others (P2P) without a middleman who can stop you (decentralized) and you don't need to fear fund loss (trustless)

"Cornell shows 2 years ago that FULL 4MB blocks would lead to a loss of *maybe* 500 nodes, while allowing millions of new users and tens of thousands of new nodes.

The authors of that paper even recently said it was out of date and the system could handle more with less loss of *non mining node centralization*



Let's not forget that the word 'centralization' and 'decentralization' come from how modern FIAT is controlled by banks by having control of the ledger, and by decentralizing control of the ledger you have have a currency where people can send money directly to others (P2P) without a middleman who can stop you (decentralized) and you don't need to fear fund loss (trustless)

As we can see ***Only mining nodes factor into decentralization***

PGP inventor Phil Zimmerman was caught in a long-standing courtroom battle with the US government, who claimed that his selling of PGP online was the equivalent of exporting munitions to foreign entities. This later prompted him to release a free version of PGP, which actually got him into even more trouble. He was eventually successful in defending his case, with the help of MIT and various other organizations who provided legal and financial support.

So, I'm pretty sure if a government entity (US or otherwise) is going to make a stink about encrypted mail, it's going to make even more of a stink about encrypted money.

"The problem with this paper is, it is primarily intended as a functional explanation of a technical proposal, i.e. to make a bitcoin system, not an in-depth discussion of a economic model. 

It makes a couple of assumptions at the beginning (trust-based models are inherently weak, a cryptographic model is fundamentally more secure) then dives right in. While those assumptions aren't incorrect, they're also not precise. If a trust based model is 99.9999% secure, and bitcoin is 99.99999999999% secure, that's a small but substantive difference. There are real situations where that difference will matter. But if the security needs of 99.99999999% of users is 98%, it's meaningless. 

The point being: understanding bitcoin from a technical perspective is important, but so is understanding it in an economics context. Don't just read this paper and think 'oh wow, Bitcoin is totally the future' and rush out and needlessly sink all your money into it.
