"It's far more likely than any other altcoin to ""win"" in the long run if that's what you're saying. Bitcoin has name recognization and is by far the most secure blockchain on the planet. 

The problem with alts (which again is what I'm assuming you're referring to) is that their hash-power becomes increasing diluted the more of them that there are. Eventually you'll have alts that are so weak that anybody could overpower them with a little bit of hash-power and invalidate the entire blockchain, this is currently impossible with bitcoin and most likely forever will be as the price continues to increase. 

I think we'll see a pretty well-known chain get hit with a 51% attack and that will cause lots of alts to collapse and money to flood back to bitcoin, the higher the price of a cryto-currency the better the security, by owning bitcoin you're basically paying a premium for the most secure blockchain in the world which is why I think it'll ""win"" without a doubt.

"\>You guys

Speak for yourself. The Bitcoin devs and many people in this space are working to make Bitcoin a viable alternative to fiat.";3;3;False;NeoMedievalist;e3q5ioa;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg
"Most of us aren't trying to get rich in Fiat.

Many believe in the philosophy surrounding Bitcoin.

**I have some Bitcoin as an insurance policy.  Much like I also keep 3 gallons of fresh water in my home in-case my water gets shut off for the day.**  Likewise, I *always* have >$1,000 of bitcoin permanently stored in my brain (memorized 12-word seed).  The fact that this is possible is mind-blowing. I could store $20,000,000 in my brain if I trusted my memory that much.

For those that aren't impressed by this, or don't appreciate how bitcoin works, this is different than ""memorizing a password to login to coinbase to access my bitcoins"".  The 12 words *are* *literally* my Bitcoins.

Small example of a bitcoin insurance policy that doesn't include the US dollar collapsing:

If I travel to Cuba and run out of whatever US cash I initially brought with me, I'm fucked.  You can't withdraw cash from a US bank account or receive a bank wire from America.  Now, I will always have enough Bitcoins to buy myself a plane ticket back to America no matter where I find myself in the world. (And before you ask, yes, you can actually use the bitcoins in Cuba to get cash - that's not just hopeful thinking).

\------------------------------

**Edit:**

Replying to ""Stranded in cuba? That's an unlikely scenario"": It happened last year to my American friend who went there on his Swedish passport.  He simply budgeted poorly, but could just as easily been pick-pocketed. He couldn't get a wire from his american bank account or from his family in Sweden. He didn't eat the last day so he would have cash for the cab to the airport.  This guy is a 25yo banker who makes over $200,000 per year. he's a smart well-connected guy. Got caught off guard.

**The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.**

* How likely is it that you become a victim of identity theft, and your bank freezes all your bank accounts? Similarly: Do you think it will get resolved in <1 week? What if it doesn't, yet you need to pay rent? Buy food
* How likely is it that i get stuck in a foreign country without cash? (As described above, happens.)
* How likely is it that you may want to withdraw more cash from an ATM than your bank will allow in 1 day (for some people, this limit is literally $500?)
* How likely is it that Visa goes down for 3 days and your credit card stops working? (Like it did in the UK just last month)
* How likely is it that your bank makes a clerical mistake and accidentally locks/freezes your credit card?
* How likely is it that the government keeps printing more money causing rapid inflation and the value of FIAt currency to keep falling? (For Americans this is unlikely, but for other countries, it is inevitable).

And yes, many of these scenarios *could* be satisfied with cash. (disclosure I also have $500 in cash in my house for this exact reason). However, you can't store that in your brain and transport it on planes without questions. It can be confiscated, stolen, burnt, etc. Storing $100,000 in your house? Riskier.

Lastly: I don't think *that* many people living in India thought that it was *likely* that their government would spontaneously decree that **all cash-bills over $20 would become illegal** **overnight.** But it happened. and it caused a massive 2-month-long run-on the banks to exchange their now illegal $100 bills for cash. That happened less than 1 year ago.

People in America probably didn't think it was likely that the government would make owning gold illegal and confiscate your stash of gold. But it happened.

Nothing seems likely untill it occurs, then you're shit out of luck.

Bitcoin is a radically new element of our world - one of those benefits is an last-resort emergency cash stash that was never previously possible.";39;11;False;GabeNewell_;e3q3ph1;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

"You have no idea what it was like back then. Coins were very hard to buy and apart from random enthusiasts selling alpaca socks and candy for them, nobody used them. When it hit $1 everyone thought it was a crazy bubble and way overvalued for a random tech experiment. The “we’re gonna take down the world financial system” folks were far rarer and less outspoken and there were far more technical people who spoke more about that.

For some perspective, luke-jr and I used to joke on IRC that we’d sell all our coins when they hit $25 apiece, because it seemed like such a batshit insane number that it seemed like a reasonable way to say “I’m not selling”. I’d be willing to bet that 99% of very early adopters sold most of their coins when it hit $1, or on the rundown from the $31 ATH, or possibly around $100 if they held on hard.

Very easy to look back and say “well obviously just hold on and you’ll be rich” but when you have bills to pay and $10k is a healthy sum that would make life a lot easier, and you’re already very far ahead, most people would probably sell a substantial number.";10;1;False;godofpumpkins;e3prv7k;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

Showed this to a friend and just now learned that he had no idea why I was always mentioning fiat when talking about crypto. He didn't know what fiat cars had to do with cryptocurrency, but wasn't actually interested enough to ask...been obsessed with crypto for a year now :/;1;0;False;th8a_bara;e3oflvc;We waited for that...;94qofa;https://i.redd.it/6a7xytdds8e11.jpg

"Yes, but the important part: is that once you have your piece of the Bitcoin pie, no one can make your piece any smaller relative to the whole. No matter how far you decide to shift the decimal place.  When you buy a bitcoin, don't think of it as owning ""1 bitcoin"", think of it as owning 1/21,000,000th of the pie.  Breaking-down bitcoin to smaller decimals doesn't change that.

**This is different when** ***governments*** **print money, as they don't distribute it evenly across all their citizens.**  They use the money themselves to fund whatever they want.  This causes your ""piece of the pie"" to shrink relative to the whole.

**This is what is known as ""inflation"".**

\---

Tomorrow, the government could print $1,000,000,000,000,000 USD and all the money in your bank account would be worth nothing.  The only reason they don't do this is because we trust our government and believe that they won't decide to do that.  Instead, we socially agree that 3% inflation per year is fair.   In venezuela, the government literally did this.  Times got tough, and the government said ""fuckit"", and printed so much money that all the money the citizen's held became worthless.  Then the economy collapsed. 

Tomorrow, we could all agree to shift the decimal place on bitcoins 1 digit, so now everyone has 10x the amount of bitcoin.  Nothing would happen. Everyone would still own the same fraction of the pie. Instead of paying 0.0003 bitcoin in miner fees, people would pay 0.003 bitcoin in miner fees.

In short: moving the decimal place in Bitcoin doesn't break anything.  Moving the decimal place in a FIAT currency breaks everything. ";4;0;False;GabeNewell_;e3o5u96;We waited for that...;94qofa;https://i.redd.it/6a7xytdds8e11.jpg
I'd argue that computing power provably spent (PoW) can be considered a real asset. Various systems throughout the real world would benefit from such a strong network.
