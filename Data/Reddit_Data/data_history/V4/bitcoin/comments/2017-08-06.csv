">Counting chickens before they hatch caused the housing loan crisis, or did you forget?

The housing crisis of 2007-2011 was caused by the newly deregulated private mortgage industry in 2003-2006 giving TRILLIONS in ""suicide"" loans to specuvestors and people who lacked any of 4Cs of credit and being able to sell these quite dodgy loans on to bagholder investors via improper credit ratings by the several ratings agencies.

What made the crash of 2008-2010 worse was the wider economy of 2002-2006 was being entirely juiced by the cash-out refis pushing up to $100B PER MONTH into the middle-class homeowner consumer economy (plus the wealth effect of rising home valuations making people more happy to spend $ even if they didn't ""cash out"" / borrow more then).

"Hard forks are also pretty common, but that is when they become alt coins (or at least what is claimed to be such).  That is also true in most open source software projects where it is extremely rare to see a hard fork... even for word processors, video games, or something like a simple calculator app.  Such hard forks occasionally happen (like Libre Office forking from Open Office), but it is usually due to a break down of the internal politics or a single organization seizing control of the project and refusing to let others get involved.

Most open source projects require changes to be something you argue about within the project (the Linux mailing list being a really good example... or Wikipedia talk pages) and requires consensus to be achieved before drastic changes start to happen.

"> The fact 

You say that a lot.  I think it's another word you should query the definition of, because you are not applying it correctly.   I get it.  You haven't really thought it through. 

Think of bitcoin as an envelope.  A really secure one.  One that uses energy to secure its contents, where it becomes exponentially more secure the longer it is on the blockchain.  Where the contents of the envelope are secrets that people attach value to.  Where the barrier to securing your envelope requires the computing power of a raspberry pi, can be done pseudonymously, and remains just as secure.  Fun fact : you can store any information you want on the blockchain. 

So instead of talking about air conditioners, we can talk about bitcoin instead? It will make it easier to understand if you stop using analogies that don't apply ( like fiat), and actually learn how bitcoin works, and more importantly, why.

"I both agree and disagree, depending on your definition of gambling.

If by gambling you mean that people are throwing in money with no _guarantee_ that they'll see profit, then it's obviously gambling. But then, by this definition, _all_ investing is gambling, just with varying levels of risk.

If by gambling you mean that people are throwing in money and hoping to profit with no reasoning to _suggest_ that they will, I don't think this is the case with most Bitcoin investors. I think most see the potential in decentralized currency, and expect it to grow as a result (i.e. they're speculating).";1;0;False;farsightxr20;dl7ziv9;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"what caused the housing crisis was corporate-insider **control fraud** among mortgage originators, Wall Street investment houses, and the ratings agencies, not our monetary system. They knew what they were doing was wrong (unsustainable) but the profits were quite sufficient to do it anyway.

While I generally detest Austrianism as a rich-man's ideology, I do agree with the criticism that the current monetary environment is being abused to patch together a broken system.

Capital should be available to those who have productive needs for it, and fiat and/or fractional reserve lending (contrary to the FPP these are not the same thing) is a great way to facilitate that.

While it can be abused by politicians unwilling to enact unpopular tax policies, I trust democratic systems over he-who-has-the-gold-makes-the-rules systems.

Today Bitcoin (and the other major cryptos) do not amount to much in the grand scheme of things, but at this rate of growth BTC, and ETH (among others) will soon become much more attractive to many people, for various uses, and thus there will be a reaction against blockchain currencies.  

Now, some economists will see another story: as people around the world adopt BTC (and dollars) in preference to their national currencies, the value of BTC (and the dollar) will rise. The government never wants to see the dollar become too valuable. Siphoning some value away from the $ into BTC might be extremely convenient for the USG.

"FYI, you automatically lose the argument when you start with ""By that logic..."" It demonstrates that you are just playing some sort of gotcha game and not interested in actually understanding the other person or having a serious debate. 

In its time, people actually did justify slavery with arguments that slaves somehow aren't  ""real"" people, and the state didn't recognize them as citizens, so they didn't really have any rights. So, for the people exploiting them, it was fine, even justified because they were savages who needed to be civilized or something.

Now we recognize these things called human rights and when we make the rules for the game of our economy we try very hard to not violate those human rights.

 A Rational compromise when it comes to engineering trade-offs will concern technical merits being weighed and then determining if the benefit outweighs the cost. 

Absolutely none of that happened in this circumstance. This rational compromise you speak of is 100% politics and has no merit in regards to technical arguments. That makes this a completely irrational compromise if you can even call it a compromise to begin with.

Rational engineer's will collect data from proposed changes before they introduce major changes to the system that affects everyone in a non backwards compatible way.

What you are going to find in the next few months is that the system is going to be working great and the resource usage will be at all-time lows now that we have finally implemented technologies that increase the efficiency of transactional bandwidth and resource usage.

"I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but this presents a horribly biased and one-sided view. The whole world could read it, and it's quite possible some people might be convinced, but quite a few people will just laugh at how naive or one-sided this is.

There are several advantages to so-called fiat currency that do not work when used with something like Bitcoin. People didn't abandon the Gold Standard because they foresaw the possibility of a large police/surveillance state run by governments and corporations and wanted to get there faster - they abandoned the Gold Standard because it became a measurable and constant problem for the economy, and nations as a whole. When your currency is backed by some $thing, then your economy can only ever grow as ""large"" as your supply of $thing. Your economy ""grows"" when your supply of $thing ""grows"", and your economy stagnates when you can't get more $thing. It doesn't matter if, for instance, your country becomes measurably better at producing of things because you've created advances like assembly line manufacturing - the value of your country's economy is not measured in production, it's measured in how much of $thing your country's government has laid claim to. Printing money is only possible if a) your country's supply of $thing grows, or b) your country essentially debases its currency, meaning that every dollar (or euro, or yuan, or rupee, or yen, or whatever) is worth less... and so the total amount of your economy remains the same. 

The Gold Standard is what caused shit like Mercantilism to be the leading economic theory of Europe for the longest time - if every currency is backed by an asset, then having as much of that asset is what gives power, and so you want the minimum amount of that asset leaving the country as possible and the maximum amount entering as possible. This leads to shit like colonization and ruthless expansionism - after all, if you're required to import a good like oil or wool or uranium because you can't get it yourself, then you're constantly losing some of whatever asset your currency is backed by/based on, and so there's a constant drain on power, so you should strive to find a source of that material or good that you can lay claim to, or otherwise take away someone else's.

"Point 2 is understood just fine. The only thing you do with printing more money is moving the crash into the future where it becomes much worse. What happens is either you'll have hyperinflation or a very big crash. 
They were issuing bank notes like crazy and scholars of the austrian economy understood this early enough, which is why Ludwig von Mises, one of the most notable economists from the austrian school at that time, accurately predicted the crisis. Actually all major economic crisis that followed were predict by such economists.

There was also a crash at the beginning of the 1920s that nobody seems to remember because it went by so quickly. Back then they refused to inflate and print more money and intervene too much into the economy. What happened was a quick recovery and it became nothing worth mentioning anymore. 
After the crash in 1930 they did the complete opposite: big government spending programs, printing money etc... Which resulted in the big depression.

Of course crashes can happen in a pure gold using society as well. But they would effect only certain branches and be quickly done with instead of effecting the whole economy.

this is what will revolutionize bitcoin, when it is available remotely anywhere on earth from locally broadcasting nodes for local communities to transact through a single portable computer system directly to mobile devices as local hubs and hotspots or over satellite internet networks of the given regions. Too many people are only focused with turning Bitcoin into another stock to trade and drive into the ground.

"**G. Edward Griffin**

G. Edward Griffin (born November 7, 1931) is an American far-right conspiracy theorist, author, lecturer, and filmmaker. He is the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island (1994), which promotes theories about the motives behind the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Griffin's writings include a number of views regarding various political, defense and health care interests. In his book World Without Cancer, he argues that cancer is a nutritional deficiency that can be cured by consuming amygdalin, a view regarded as quackery by the medical community.

Recession and even depressions are a healthy part of a capitalistic market.  They force weak businesses to die and they reward and encourage a saving habit.  Housing is a good example of this.  If the market just keeps going up there's no incentive to save and wait for a correction.  It also keep new home buyers out.  A downturn allows for a shake up and for new buyers to enter the market. It's when you artificially prevent recession and depression with government intervention you set yourself up for huge depressions and enormous systemic risk that could take the whole system down.;4;1;False;JackGetsIt;dl7wpho;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

Deflation is deflation, there are different drivers but it doesn’t matter the effect is the same. Bitcoin’s problem is that there is limited number of coins due to further increasing costs associated with block chain validation causing the value of coins to increase. The money supply is tight and causes prices to decrease. This continual decrease is problematic because people have less incentive to spend or lend bitcoin IF they know the value of their holdings will be increasing for the foreseeable future.

"> Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault.

But never more than what is covered by assets. Gold isn't the only asset.

> After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.

No, they are not. Problem is when people withdraw money faster than the bank an liquidate other assets.

There are also problems if assets fall in value (e.g. customers failing to pay back loans). However, this is a problem even if there isn't a bank run.

> All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.

There was no limit to what the **central bank** could create. It did not change for commercial banks.

> From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset.

For commercial banks, money is still supported by assets, it is just that the assets are not gold. E.g. it can be mortgage on real estate. For the central banks, the are still assets, even though they do not cover all the created money. You could say that the main asset is the confidence in the state. Certainly, this confidence has been violated frequently, especially in poorly developed countries.

> The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006.

That is because it has no purpose. The important thing is to have a controlled inflation (though how much inflation depends on who you ask).

> Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.

"The B-money paper specifically points out:

> 1. The creation of money. Anyone can create money by broadcasting the
solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. **The only
conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort
it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no
value, either practical or intellectual.** The number of monetary units
created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a
standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours
to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3
standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer
on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that
problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.
