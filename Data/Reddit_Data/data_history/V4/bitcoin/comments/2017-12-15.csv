Who are you, that you get to decide what the ""ultimate aims of education"" are? Who died and left you to define the purpose of the pursuit of knowledge?

Your argument doesn't have a premise.  There is no discernible argument to dismiss.  You inability to produce one is the basis of my skepticism of your academic credentials.

You clearly don't understand the concept of hegemony.  The modern status-quo is a neo-liberal interpretation of schools as spaces to produce participants in a market economy.  While I recognize the importance of trade-skill training, this is a strong deviation from my primary argument that education, especially higher-education, is a space for developing one's ability to critically evaluate the accepted status-quo and hold nuanced understandings of issues in order to be more productive members of a democratic society.

These things have value. Bitcoin is literally valueless. You are assigning it value based on it's 'rarity' and saying ""look, it's a currency now""

Just think of it this way: If there were only 10 people on earth who wanted bitcoin, then bitcoin would be relatively worthless, as there are millions of bitcoin. Each one would be worth barely anything. 

Now, the pool has grown to millions of people. There is still the same amount of bitcoin, it doesn't change. The value has risen drastically because of the expanding pool; this leads to deflation, which causes people to hold on to their coins, because they believe the value will be greater in the future. As people sell their coins, the pool shrinks, and the value decreases. This leads to a massive drop.

Your bank charges you fees. You pay taxes. Part of both go towards keeping the infrastructure for the USD fiat system in place. (Keeping those dollars fresh) I don't see the fees as an argument against the system. Yes I agree, they are too high right now, but it's a new tech.

Cash is instant but can also be counterfeit (especially USD, you guys need to get on that!) Credit cards are not instant and you risk identity theft. There is a serious problem with chargebacks. Also, it's not settled for quite some time. Near instant settlement WILL be accomplished with bitcoin, just taking some time for the technology to get caught up to the influx of people.

Well if I put btc in a wallet... it'll be the same amount 5, 10, 20 years from now. Maybe you're talking about the value. Go look up the value of the dollar and see how much it's fluctuated over the years. Food prices actually don't go up, it's becoming easier and easier to produce and distribute food. But the value of a dollar has been going waaaay down, so it looks like prices for food go up (probably worse in Canada than US). Your dollar is being devalued and is deflationary. Maybe you can argue why that's a good thing... but you can't say the value will be the same in 5, 10, 20 years. Also, maybe in the US you've got a better chance in the long run, but what about Venezuela, Argentina?

"Nicehash is a one stop shop for mining that will pick the most profitable algorithm for your computer and pay you in bitcoin. My 970 gets me about 1.50/day. I use “one click miner” to mine vertcoin (mainly because I love vertcoin, but they just halved the block reward so it may not be that worthwhile anymore), or you could try minergate, which will probably have you mining monero. If you’re looking for a little more DIY, you could check out ccminer or cgminer, which will allow you to choose which coin you mine. They require a bit more input on your part, but the process is easily explained by google. 

Realistically though nowadays I haven’t found a coin that’s “profitable” to mine. Machines specifically designed for mining have completely taken over big game coins like bitcoin. I’ve been aiming more towards any miner that’ll give me a relatively large volume of coin in the hopes that it’ll be worth more money in the future. If that’s your aim, I’ve been using minergate to mine BCN with my cpu (I still use my gpu to mine vertcoin as mentioned above) and I’ve gotten about 400 coins.

">I know right! And then that worked out terribly for the value of gold!

The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry industry, not because its a failed currency.

Gold has no value as a currency, but that doesn't make gold worthless because its valuable for other things.

One of the reasons gold was abandoned as a currency was because people kept hoarding and melting down coins because it was far more valuable as a metal than as a currency.

It becoming deflationary was a sign that it was a waste to use a very rare metal like gold for currency when more common metals like copper and steel worked just as well.

You won't want to follow this logic through when it says that bitcoin will be abandoned for a less deflationary currency.

When bitcoin becomes too deflationary to have any use as a currency (which it already nearly is even when supply is as high as it will ever be), what will it be valuable for? ""It's a store of value"", why? ""there's only a limited number"". Okay so why would I store my value in bitcoin which is valuable for nothing else except being a store of value when I could buy land, which there's also only a limited amount of but that has a million different practical uses if I can't sell it to anyone.

"You completely missed my points. The alt coins will in fact minimize transaction fees- that's why they exist. It might require an absolute minimum amount of transactions using bitcoin to get those altcoins if your store of value happens to be in bitcoin. Your original argument was that no one could possibly sell bitcoin to anyone and I showed you why you were mistaken.

""There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold.""

This is inherently false. There absolutely is a fee acquiring and depositing gold, keeping it safe, carrying it around. The overwhelming majority of interactions are made using fiat currency precisely because gold is cumbersome as a medium of exchange. This is why I explained to you how gold would still convey its value even if fiat is used in most transactions- it has a direct correlation to the bitcoin/altcoin relationship.

Gold has no more inherent value than bitcoin does. It's a piece of metal. How does it keep you alive? A loaf of bread is infinitely more valueable in a true end of the world scenario than a lump of metal. This fallacious argument has been used ad nauseum and it's so simple to rebute. Bitcoin can't be duplicated. It's decentralized. It's immune to inflation. It's anonymous. All these add to it's value. To believe the price of bitcoin is high only because of speculation is silly.

"In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs,"" on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, ""smart Ponzis"").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]

Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).";1;1;False;Z0di;dr9kild;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"I mean, i've been looking/tracking/playing/lurking around in this space for a few years now, out of a general interest of Cryptography. Right now, I'm mostly divied up between Bitcoin, Ethereum, OmiseGo, Augur, and Enjin Coin along with a small stake in some PREICO's i thought interesting but haven't gotten off the ground yet, and probably/might not do anything at all. I look at ICOs/Alts pretty often though, to try and scout out anything that may be interesting.


Coins that I haven't invested in, but have my eye on are IOTA, Cardano, Dash, RDN, Monero, ZCash, and Substratum. There are various reasons I haven't invested yet, including sketchiness (Cardano/IOTA) not enough research done (RDN), and, from some humble calcs that probably mean nothing profitability (these calculations are very subjective, and it really just comes down to gambling). However, if I do invest in another coin, there's much more of a % of me investing in coins I have my eye on/have done previous research on.

When people say '90% of ICO's are a scam', I am not going to lie, it's usually true. Though, some aren't a scam and just fail immediately because their entire concept is shit. It's mostly like gambling though; you just have to invest a little money and see where it goes, but be 100% aware that you have a 50/50 chance of losing everything, with the other 50 being 45% breaking even with the hope of going up sometime, and 5% making some money. (these percentages are out of my ass, obviously, but that's what it feels like). Though, all in all, when an ICO *does* do well, I tend to make up what I lost with other ICO's. An amount of diversification plays into it, too.


But, the rule i always follow when investing in any crypto, ICO or not, is just to do as much research as you can with your time, and only invest in projects that you believe in. I invested in ENJ because I do/have played a fuckton of videogames in the past, and I see that the coin has real potential in the market they are going to chase. In addition to this, they already have up against competing coins (GameCredits, etc) in their developers  and Community Base (they are a company which runs forums for gamers, with the # of members in the millions, with many communities already signed up to use the coin) The research I did shows that what they're trying to achieve is absolutely realistic. I won't invest in random coins in a market that I know absolutely nothing on how it operates (like those coins used for selling meat goods, or Credit coins, or other coins like that. They may be 100% viable, or they may be total shitcoins. I have no idea, so when I come across something like that, I immediately skip it).

You also have to be aware of what existing coins are capable of. If a coin comes out and can do nothing different than a coin that already established a userbase (assuming the coin cant do it better than the already-established coin), that's a downright dumb buy. If a coin does something which can already be done on an existing coin/blockchain, that's another stupid buy. Why create a coin who's use can already be had quite easily with another (much more established) coin? Not much use there.
That's part of the reason ERC20 coins (coins created with the ETH ecosystem) are so cool. _Because_ they have the base of a community already, Ethereum,

that's just my 2c and experience though.

TL;DR: Be aware of existing coins and what they do; stay open-minded to new coins and what they may be capable of; don't invest in stupid shit that can already be accomplished with existing coins; only invest in shit you believe in/have experience a knowledgebase in; do your research.

The first line alone completely contradicts your point. How can bitcoin be a Ponzi scheme when there is no ""schemer"", interacting with all participants directly?

Again: you need to spend a small amount of time reading up on what a Ponzi scheme is. Here's a start:

>A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒn.zi/; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.

Bitcoin trading on regulated exchanges isn't fraudulent, there is no operator, and return isn't being generated through revenue paid by new investors. None of this definition matches what bitcoin is.

"So your entire argument is that bitcoin fees won't negatively affect bitcoin because altcoin trading avoids fees somehow?  Sorry, but transfering you bitcoin means I pay a fee.  It doesn't matter if you are sending me back cash, altcoins, or physical goods.  There is no way around the fee.

As long as there are high fees for transmitting coin between people, bitcoin isn't sustainable as a currency.

Right now its value is proped up on supply and demand.   If demand drops, it all crumbles.  If supply(the amount of people trying to sell) increases, it all crumbles.

Bitcoin requires more people to be buying bitcoin for cash than are trying to sell it for cash.  When that ratio flips, bitcoin flips.

>According to your logic, the value of gold would ""collapse"" because it's not a good currency.

Gold is free to hand to someone. There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold.  Gold only requires a fee if you want to convert it to cash and only because someone might not buy gold from  you directly as there is no level of trust.  If you must sell to a middle man, then there is a fee.  

That said, if no one wanted to buy gold, the price of gold would fall.  It is still supply and demand.  It has an advantage in that it is a physical product that goes into electronics so there will always be some kind of demand for it and that large holders of it aren't selling what they have.  If everyone who owned gold tried to sell it at the same time, the price would drop heavily.  The floor would be based on the demand by companies using it for products who must still buy it. If they are willing to buy tons of it for future production at low prices that would prevent even lower prices.

>According to you, the dollar doesn't need gold to function- and no one would ever purchase gold with dollars. It's just poor analytical thinking on your part.

This seemlying has nothing to do with what I said and makes little sense. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder.  First, the dollar is not pegged to gold.  Gold could become worthless tomorrow, it would harm the value of the dollar.  In fact, it would increase the value of the dollar since more people would want dollars.  Second, the reverse is meaningless.  Why would it matter if people buy gold with dollars?  Not sure what you mean by this.

"Half of the world doesn't have access to banks but most of them do have access to rudimentary smart phones. Bitcoin (or a form of cryptocurrency) could essentially bank the unbanked half of the world (3 billion people) with the simple downloading of an app. Is there no value in that?

Because you wouldn't have bought back then. The thing is, bitcoin can raise up to a million in the next 10-20 years. You won't believe me now and therefor you won't put money into it. Back then was the exact same thing, no one who didn't really understand what Bitcoin is would believe that it'll reach 15k one day and surely not within a year, so everyone said that the price is to high already and wouldn't buy. That same thing is repeating right now and in 10 years people will complain how they didn't buy when btc was at 15k. You just think that you would have bought because now you already know it would have reached 17k. You just have to accept that you would have done back then the same that you are doing now. Have you put anything into bitcoin now? No? Then don't be mad, you wouldn't have invested back then either. If you have now then congrats, you might reap a fortune in 10-20 years if you have the patience and mindset not to sell when the price doubles.;1;1;False;thorle;dra2lyz;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

Second scenario. Invest the same amount, $100. Bitcoin rises 2x. You hold. Bitcoin rises 5x. You sell for $1,000. You now have $1,000.

In the first strategy you minimize the risk of losing $100 but at the same time you are making possible future profits smaller.

"Depends on when and how. He's not functionally wealthy if his only assets are Bitcoin. It's nearly impossible to liquidate that number of crypto at this value. For example, if you had 100 million in gold you'd have about 2.5 tons of it. Try to buy anything with that. Need to by a Camry? You'd have to find someone who will buy $20,000 worth of gold for cash. Not saying it's impossible, but most crypto markets, like banks, limit the amount of cash you can take out. Also, Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends.

So, maybe you slowly cash out what you need this year, say $100k just to be comfortable. Then Bitcoin crashes down to $5k or less, or completely bottoms out (unlikely). You're fucked.

"You don't get it.  No one can convert bitcoin to cash without selling it to someone who wants to convert cash to bitcoin.  Period.  

That is the only way.  I people buying into bitcoin dries up, bitcoin will crash because people are still going to want out and will have to lower what they get hoping to attract buyers.

"No, that's not the only way.

>Companies that engage in Ponzi schemes focus all of their energy into attracting new clients to make investments. Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to older investors. When this flow runs out, the scheme falls apart.[2]



>In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs,"" on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, ""smart Ponzis"").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]

>Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

>In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).";1;1;False;Z0di;dr9ju35;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"Hi Pine!

I think you are _probably_ relatively well-protected if you are being sufficiently careful -- I see ""offline"" and ""we"", and I hope your procedure involves something like: at least two different people verify every aspect of each transaction, on at least two computers.

In that case, and assuming you're using robust software (by which I mean Bitcoin Core), I'm not aware of any specific examples of this having gone wrong in the past.

One interesting corner case was recently discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list (I just googled ""bitcoin 'cosmic ray'"" for examples, and it turned up): while transaction _addresses_ are protected by checksums, and in robust software such as Bitcoin Core they should be well-protected, transaction _amounts_ have no such protection. So the following scenario is possible today:

- You instruct your online wallet to send 50 BTC to address 'B'
- Your online wallet crafts a transaction that spends your 4000 BTC UTXO, sending 50 BTC to address 'B' and 3950 BTC back to a new change address, 'C'
- In the transfer to your offline wallet, a single bit flips, and 3950 becomes 1902
- You check the amount being sent to the _destination_ on the offline wallet, but you don't check the amount sent to _change_
- 2048 bitcoins are accidentally sent to fees in the transaction you sign and transmit.

As to whether bitflips actually happen: they absolutely do although I don't have a convincing specific example handy (I've asked my coworkers for one.) If you're using consumer hardware without ECC RAM, here's an article computing the expected bitflip rate:

http://lambda-diode.com/opinion/ecc-memory

The conclusion is ""the probability of having at least one bit error in 4 gigabytes of memory at sea level on planet Earth in 72 hours is over 95%.""

The specific example I gave can be prevented by checking every aspect of the transaction, including all addresses and all amounts (including change) very carefully before signing. I can't immediately think of a specific failure that couldn't be avoided by (1) checking the transaction carefully on the computer where you construct it; (2) checking the transaction carefully on the offline computer before signing; and (3) checking the transaction carefully _again_ on the online computer before broadcast (this protects against e.g. bitflips after (2) but before the actual signing process.) This is all assuming you're using Bitcoin Core, which is itself very careful to double-check everything.

Still, I hope you can see why the notion of keeping so much money in a single UTXO is scary to me; this whole process is very delicate, and a single unnoticed bit error in the wrong place could render it lost, and bit errors absolutely do happen in the real world. (Of course, you are not the first person by far to keep an astronomical sum in a single UTXO; MtGox very famously did so in order to prove solvency once, before later becoming insolvent. But I wouldn't take advice from MtGox.)

I am very glad to hear that you are working offline, carefully, with multiple people (hopefully) checking things before they go out. That will save you from many failure modes far more likely than the one I'm concerned about. (But I was mostly assuming that already, since your coins have survived this long!) It's mostly just a belt-and-suspenders thing. You can never be too careful, and this is the first time in human history that such a large amount of value could ever have hinged irretrievably on a single bit. (In banking, at least, such an error could be manually rolled back! In Bitcoin, we play for keeps. And consumer computer hardware kind of sucks and is not designed for high-assurance work!)

I greatly appreciate what you're doing! It's a wonderful thing and I hope it all goes off without a hitch (and I hope people stop sending you pleas to personally send them bitcoin, since I see you've upgraded the wording on that at least once and added boldface to it... but I'm sure they won't.)

"I’m an me sufferer, i have been dismissed and neglected by modern medicine. I have just had to write a letter to my gp because she recommended a harmful exercise as treatment. This is a very serious illness with a biological cause. It’s not tired all the time, The key symptom is an intolerance to exertion, even the slightest activity can cause horrendous payback/sickness for Upto a week. execise can cause permanent relapses and even death in very rare and extreme cases. Suicide is 5 times more likely too. It’s like living in a prison with no walls, many patients are isolated are abandoned. Poor psychological research and changing the name to chronic fatigue syndrome has muddied the waters and made a total mess. Fraudulent studies have stolen the treatment narrative and resulted in harmful exercise based treatments be adopted by NICE and CDC. Thankfully these treatments have been shown to be ineffective and harmful and are being dropped. Research is massively underfunded for such a common disease and is way behind other equivalent diseases. The disease has no specialty home, there are a handful of doctors in the world, patients are left to fend for themselves as Gps don’t know how to treat it.

There is high uncertainty in the maximum amount that AMF could use productively, though we expect the maximum to be much greater than what AMF is likely to receive.

"Hi u/pineappleFund I like the name , I have a few suggestions for you . I understand that many people suggest to go for the save charities and i am fine with that.  It is a safe way of doing Things.    

I would like to suggest that you  use some of the Money to help in a differend way . As  a Mod in r/gofundme and r/charity i see daily people strugling , they will go to gofundme and ask for all kind of help , but the sad thing is that there are two big problems , most crowdfunding sides are expencive until a few eeks ago gofundme would take 8 % , now they just take the fee of 3 % and ask the donor for a donation of 15 % .    

This Means that it is in the interest of gofundme to stimulte anybody to ask for anything after all every dollar donated will mean Money in the cooprate pockets and with 3000 new campaigns per day that is a lot of Money made. Sadly this also Means that loads of scammers will make post on gofundme.   as go fundme allows anybody to use any name and you can even send the Money to a differend account .     

So a new way of crowndfunding that will bennefit people without that some Commercial industry as owner earns Money on it combined with security measures that will keep scammers at bay , this could often be that people that write they had a car accident would provide a police report and if your dog is sick then a vet bill with the name and phone number of the vet should be possible.     

second sugestion , you like pineapple I like bamboo , bamboo is the fastes growing product that can be used for anything like clothing , thoothbrush, Building material , food etc etc , so mayeb some Money could be used to make and grow more environmental products that coudl crreate jobs at the same time.   maybe some small research grant in developing Bamboo as a more meanstream product.    

a Kill the pay day loan program , to many ""stupid"" people will get in traps of payday loans , a politica lobby against it combined with a loan system that would help people to get out the 26 % loans would help a lot of people .   This could be done by introducting a P to P loan system where Groups of people help people to get out of dept ( via paypal goods and service )so there is not a lot of risq for whomever helps to give the loan but it would need a platform and legal advice behind it.      

I know that all these ideas need some creative thinking and maybe a small think tank , but it could have a huge impact on many people

I think this would go much further than simply donating to non-profits. As we have seen simply Spoon feeding in disadvantaged communities does not help change the situation. Once funds dry up its back to square one.

"Pineapple Fund, THANK YOU for doing this! I just submitted our grant request on behalf of The Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness.  With your support, we can give hope and access to resources for recovery.  

Eating Disorder facts are startling, you can have the power to help change these statistics, thank you!

**The Impact of Eating Disorders on Our Communities**

* **At least than 30 million Americans will battle an eating disorder during their lifetime**

* **Every 62 minutes at least one person dies as a direct result of an eating disorder**

* Eating disorders are devastating, biologically-based mental illnesses that wreak havoc on the lives of individuals struggling as well as their families and loved ones 

* Physicians are not trained on how to identify and manage eating disorders:  the majority of medical residents reported receiving fewer than 5 hours of training in this area, if any

* Eating disorders do not discriminate.  Eating disorders affect people of all genders, ages, races, ethnicities, body shapes and weights, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic statuses

**The Impact of Eating Disorders on Children and Adolescents**  

* There has been a **119% increase in the last decade for hospitalization for children under 12 years old**, admitted for an eating disorder

* According to the Journal of Adolescent Health, 81% of 10 year olds are more afraid of being fat than getting cancer

* **Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders** 

* Young people ages 15-24 years with anorexia have 10 times the risk of dying compared to their same age peers

* **Eating disorders are the 3rd most common chronic illness among adolescent females**

* Among adolescents with an eating disorder, fewer than 1 in 5 have received treatment

* Over one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives

* According to a sample of American elementary school girls who read magazines, 69% reported that the images pictured influenced their concept of the ideal body shape; 47% of them stated that the pictures made them want to lose weight

"I honestly admire you for this, however, financially speaking the way you want to donate isn't the most effective way of giving and helping the most people, consider something like this:

- Year 1 : give 20 millions
- Year 2:  give 25 millions (while still holding $175 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 50k by 2019)
- Year 3:  Give 30 millions (while still holding $230 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 75k by 2020)
- Year 4   Give 40 millions (while still holding $300 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 100k by 2020)
- Year 5   Give 60 Millions and Continue to give away the sum relative to the growth percentage  and so on until one bitcoin is worth $200 000 - $500 000.

By doing this you will be donating close to 200 millions in just 5 years time and still keeping the donation machine alive and growing,  you can always have a stop loss in case of a bitcoin real crash scenario and then invest the One billion Dollar you now accumulated in a traditional hedge fund, and donate the 10% (100 Million every year to charity)

This can be your life project and you can still donate everything at once at time of your choosing at a later point in your life, what you are doing is never the less noble and amazing. thanks we need more people like you.

I'd suggest starting to watch from 5.30 (that's the first good joke). You probably don't feel as strongly about the subject, but I'd guess most people would agree that something should be done to reduce the suffering involved. If you can aid with that at all, it would be a big step in the right direction.

"Hi /u/PineappleFund - and thank you so much for giving to the SENS Research Foundation!

I have three other suggestions:

* Donating for research to regenerate the teeth

*Billions* of humans are affected by cavities, decaying teeth, and other gum problems. It's a universal problem which can only benefit from more research, fueled by charitable funding.

Every single one of us will be affected at some point in our live. We are so scared of going to the dentist since childhood - and it doesn't ever stop. And not even having a good hygiena will save you from losing your teeth when you're old.

Imagine if we could regenerate enamel, regenerate gum, regrow teeth. Billions of people would be relieved, and billions of dollars in healthcare costs would be saved. 

Unfortunately I don't know of an charity which distributes grants for dental research, but some googling showed me institutes which seem to undergo promising research:

KCL: https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/research/divisions/index.aspx
(seems a bit difficult to reach them through https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/contact/contactus.aspx though)

Tufts: https://dental.tufts.edu/alumni/giving

So, I don't know if you have issues with teeth, but I kindly urge you to look into that - because I and billions of others would be so glad for advances in dentistry!

* Donating for research against tinnitus

Tinnitus is ringing in the ears which affect many millions around the world and causes a lot of sorrow: https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts/impact-tinnitus

The American Tinnitus Association (ATA) is the biggest patient association in this regard, and importantly, it funds research towards a cure.

I have contacted them and suggested they fill your form.

* Donating for research against hyperacusis

""Hyperacusis is a condition that causes a person to be unable to tolerate everyday noise levels without discomfort or pain."": http://hyperacusisresearch.org/what-is-hyperacusis/

Let me tell you from personal experience that this crap is often combined with tinnitus, and makes one's life many times more miserable.

Consider this: noise is absolutely everywhere in this world, so how can one live a decent life is even normal levels of noise are an issue? Answer: it's very hard, and when you're cursed with hyperacusis, you lose your life. Very limited job opportunities, can't have a decent gathering with friends and family, difficulties to travel, etc.

I have contacted Hyperacusis Research and suggested they fill your form.";1;0;False;machinbidule;draidfq;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

"I have always been very skeptical of large charities, as much of funds are poorly allocated and often end up in the wrong hands, be it salaries or mismanagement. Though now I believe to have found a charity worth donating to. 

Sharetanzania is a small but effective charity operating in, you've guessed it, Tanzania. Here they take in children of the streets, handicapped children and their mothers, and even stray dogs. John, the founder and person in charge, believes all life is worth saving - a truly beautiful vision, uncorrupted (as far as my research and intuition tells me)

John, besides actively running a charity, also has a YouTube channel where he often posts videos about the charity, but more often than not he talks about subjects related to philosophy, esotericism, mysticism and metaphysics. Even though i highly encourage people to read into or get involved in such topics, I know it's not for everyone. I find it truly encouraging to see John spend as much time as he does on the charity but still find the time to share his thoughts and ideas on the internet, I personally have found much wisdom, knowledge and faith by aid of his videos (After nearly 20 years of atheism I recently found God through much reading, listening and inward thought)

To get a more detailed picture of the charity I suggest to check out their website: https://www.sharetanzania.co.uk/ 
If you're interested in the topics mentioned above or just want to get a sense of things on the ground or about John, I suggest to watch some of his videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEyS0AontNPiOFt5Pttpf0Q (note: if any of you feel cringe for people talking about Jesus or God as I did, try to see past that - the Bible is merely allegorical after all.)

"/u/PineappleFund this is amazing and it sparked a conversation at dinner tonight. I saw you did something similar but there is a project called Water4 I'd love you to look into, specifically their efforts for the Congolese Pygmys who are enslaved and dying of waterborne disease. The guy who essentially frontmans the project is an absolute mensch by the name of Justin Wren - he is a Bellator MMA fighter using his platform as an athlete to raise awareness that these oppressed people travel miles each morning to collect contaminated water and their children die of waterborne illness frequently. The man has gotten malaria 3 times in these travels and it has never once impacted his will. You can hear him on Joe Rogan's podcast and see how genuine and selfless he is in his mission. https://m.water4.org/fightfortheforgotten

The donations you've already made are unreal and it would change so many lives -- and bring even more awareness to bitcoin to boot -- to donate to this cause. With Joe Rogan's platform they raised over $50k in today's dollars in BITCOIN alone, to contribute anything like what you've done for these other charities would be hugely impactful and if you hear Justin speak about it you will know that such a contribution would go to not just a great cause but to one of the world's most selfless people and it would likely be the largest single contribution anyone has made to the platform.

I'm sure you are being lit up with requests but please consider this one. Clean water wells are being dug for the pygmys at like $1000 a pop or something like that. A Pineapple Fund contribution would provide literally thousands of people with clean water for decades.

All my best

2) Yup, at this rate fiatola is sure not the real bubble as bitcoin counter-reacts to it:

http://image.ibb.co/bToOzm/money_supply.jpg

2a) Plenty of investments happen on Bitcoin. But since people value Bitcoin, they think twice before investing on garbage.

2b) Again, people value Bitcoin (unlike USD) so they don't do mindless drone consumerism. When you need to you spend it, example: I pay VPN services every month with it.
Also the fiat-rich let their money sit on banks as investment themselves since the interest rates are enough for the millions to keep raking more millions.

3) Who said USD is going to be outlawed? they make the laws themselves so their bubble of infinite debt never crashes, except laws of physics will eventually make it crash.

It's like Amazon in 1997. I remember those days well as I came out here to SF for the first dot com boom. People poked a ton of holes in companies like Amazon, and there was some froth and talks of ""tulips"" but guess what came out of it? Amazon, EBay, Google and tons of other companies that wrecked retail and other industries in less than two decades. And yet people didn't believe for years. Just like you, just like now.

Dropping out of school, drugs, having 4 kids with 4 different fathers or what about the ones who make us pay for their groceries while they buy beer, cigarettes and lottery tickets. U people aren’t even worth wasting any more time on. U obviously don’t go out. I see it every day. I know people who sell their benefits 2 for 1, or lend their card out for cash. I know gas stations that are more than happy to ring up shit as “general food items”. Get your head out of the sand. It’s everywhere around. And since when can 50 million people not improve their standards of living in America? People come from all over the world without a dime to their name, don’t speak English, but yet they find a way to make it. They start businesses, they go to college.

"Sincerest apologies and condolences. May your family and friends be supported.
Many missing the enormous returns, myself included, find rumination to be very difficult. The what/if game.
With that amount of Bitcoin a person could affect anything in life. Doubted one could arrive at that amount of worry over only self, he must've had huge plans for solving world and loved ones' issues from the billion+ usd that would convert to at this point. Perhaps concentrate on that, he was likely desiring to cause good change in the world. As many of us are who are balls deep in BTC and its world altering potential.
Listen to the guy who commented, Mt. Gox was likely how he lost it. Legalities are involved for potential recovery by immediate family. Perhaps it can be recovered and himself to live on in a legacy it could contribute to. The Mt. Gox issue is still being resolved, time will tell, and my best wishes to yourselves and all involved in the tragedy. 
God Bless.

"You should learn by yourself before jumping into arguments, especially when you are giving strong statements. But I'll do it this time.

There are two types are changes in consensus rules, aka, the protocol: soft-forks and hard-forks.

Soft-forks conform to original rules. They tighten them. They don't break the protocol. There are a lot of such changes in Bitcoin's history.

Hard-forks do not conform to original rules. They loosen them. They break the protocol. They have been a few hard-forks in Bitcoin's history. But all of them are fixing serious bugs that is **not** supposed by the protocol. There has been **zero** hard-forks that changed the consensus rules of Bitcoin.

The bottom line is: old unupgraded nodes, which represent the original Bitcoin, fully accept soft-fork changes and fully reject hard-fork changes. They agree with soft-fork changes because they don't break the original agreement, and disagree with hard-fork changes because they break the original agreement.

So to answer your question, yes, there have been a lot of changes in Bitcoin's protocol, but everyone has agreed. Since everyone agrees, we get to keep the name of Bitcoin.";2;1;False;exab;drb6ea4;"Starting a new company called Apple Unlimited! Please don't confuse this with our competitor, Apple.

The Apple / Apple Unlimited;   McDonalds/McDowells type of disputes are resolved by trade marks, trade names, and national and international laws and conventions. 

Bitcoin has none of those protections. 

Satoshi made a mistake here.   What he should have done was to use a modified open source license that included a condition that permitted use, extension, modification of the code but prohibited any implementation based on the code from using the word ""Bitcoin."" 

Since he did not, we'll get Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Green, Bitcoin 2, Electric Boogalook and, probably, Bitcoin Trump one of these days.

"Classical liberalism isnt a ""left wing"" concept.  The modern day American version of it might be but I would disagree.  I don't think anything left of center can ever be described as being liberatarian.  The whole concept is designed around creating or forcing equality, which means the removal of privileges, liberty, or property from those who already have it.  Furthermore, libertarianism implies, and requires independence from the state and the role of the state is required to be as limited as far as possible.  The role of the state should be to protect its citizens from foreign and domestic aggresion and to uphold law and order.  Unfortunately, our state and our laws have also created the concept of the ""corporation"" by giving separate legal personality to a corporate body.  Unlike a regular person, they don't die, and can ""merge"" with others to form superpersons.  These have accumulated wealth and power in a way only a few human beings have ever been able to and it is this which ultimately leads to the problems and social dissonance we see in the West today - runaway corporatism instead of free market liberal capitalism.";3;1;False;Aconite_Eagle;dradpdi;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416
"**Libertarian socialism**

Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.

Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization. It asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.

"Putin could be paying him with crypto rubbles for releasing hacked information that damaged America and I would think the exact same of wikileaks

this is all I think of wikileaks:

They release leaked information. The documents generally are of a very high level of authenticity. 

That is it. I do not bother to wonder about his true motives. They are not an issue to me.

On the topic of party > country, I think it's funny you should mention it. My opinion of wikileaks is favorable because I believe in Americans. Not the government or the institutions. But the people. I believe we should know what our government is doing. 

But I think it's funny you mention party > country, because to me it seems to take willful ignorance to pretend that the issue with the emails was with anyone but the DNC. We saw clear as day they were working to help Hillary against Bernie. We saw a member of the press provide debate questions in advance. 

Is there any surprise the DNC just changed the super delegate rule? 20% of the primary was decided by super delegates. They were exposed as corrupt and now need to make changes.

And I agree that I think he *should* have released the republican hacked emails. Him protecting the Republicans (for whatever reason) is his decision. 

Unless he willfully covered up evidence of Republicans ordering murders or something where children got hurt, my opinion of him doesn't really change";2;0;False;LyinCoin;dramc0m;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416

"There are commonalities between classical liberalism and socialism though, and workers and peasants have played important roles in the development of classical liberalism.

"> My point is, libertarianism does not have its roots in socialism. It just doesn't. There's no historical fact there.

I'll take up this argument.  Proudhon, who was a French libertarian socialist contemporary of Marx and Bakunin, and the person who first used the term ""anarchism"" in a positive political sense, arguably had some beliefs that are very much in alignment with modern American Libertarians.  He was very much against a large centralized government and government regulation.  But, as I recall, he wasn't particularly against individual wealth.  He may have opposed wealth accrued through unjust governmental action, but I don't think he was opposed to individuals attaining great wealth.  It's possible that I'm not remembering some of his finer points particularly well, but I believe my summary is accurate.  

The main difference I see between Proudhon and modern American Libertarians is that he would put more focus upon community action.  He, like the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, would have been very much in favor of trade unions/guilds and those organizations working together to provide social programs to keep society from falling apart.  Modern American Libertarians, while not necessarily opposed to those ideas overtly, don't have much to say about them and seem to act more as if every man is an island, every home is a castle, and every owned piece of land a kingdom.  On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent modern American Libertarians from organizing to create the sort of social programs pushed by the old left libertarians and socialists. 

There is certainly a thread of commonality between left libertarians and modern Libertarians when it comes to being critical of large centralized governments.  ";5;1;False;NihiloZero;dravpic;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416

"Overstock.com CEO Patrick M. Byrne did long research on that topic (his company was impacted by that problem) and made a great presentation on naked short selling. Naked short selling allows traders to sell shares which have been allocated by the broker but weren't delivered yet. Essentially this is creating shares out of thin air, since the holder still owns the shares and can sell them too - the same share can be sold multiple times, which leads inevitably to 'failed to delivers'.  The supply of fake shares can stay for a very long time in the system. There is an official database on 'failed to deliver' shares (REGSHO). This also results sometimes in more votes at shareholder meetings than shares were issued by the company.

"**Progressive stack**

A progressive stack is a technique used to give marginalized groups a greater chance to speak. It is sometimes an introduction to, or stepping stone to, consensus decision-making in which simple majorities have less power.

The progressive stack technique attempts to counter what its proponents believe is a flaw in traditional representative democracy, where the majority is heard while the minority or non-dominant groups are silenced or ignored. In practice, ""majority culture"" is interpreted by progressive stack practitioners to mean White people, men and young adults, while non-dominant groups include women, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, people of color, and very young or older people.

The leaks weren’t the reason Hillary lost. She lost because she was a terrible candidate and the Bernie supporters stayed home.

It’s as simple as that. People had made up their minds MONTHS before. They were abstaining, writing in candidates, or voting for the Donald. The base voted for Hillary because that was the only realistic thing to do. 

Stop blaming the outcome on what Russia did. Yes they fucked with our elections. But we are grown ups who can make up our minds. 

People know who they voted for. They supported a terrible human being and put him in a position of power. Russia didn’t do that. The citizens of the US did that all on their own.

Edit. I also like your last sentence. I'm not fully libertarian, but it closest describes my ideology. I have a best friend who'd say the same about himself in relation to socialism. We always get in huge arguments over public policy, politics, etc - but by the end we both realize we're arguing for essentially the same things. Same destination, different journey, I guess?

But yes. He is one of the most interesting, and most misunderstood, men in American history.

"Because as an academic, I'm aware that the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim, which means I can criticize the source without having to provide any. The information is also readily available, and has achieved consensus amongst historians, which means my critique of his claim does not require a source. His argument relies on the kind made by people like Noam Chomsky. Chomsky makes a valid argument, but his argument is still theoretical, and based on his (highly contested) interpretation of both ideologies. His source doesn't ""prove,"" that libertarianism sprung from socialism. It shows that libertarian socialism was birthed out of the two ideologies. This is the general consensus amongst historians. An overwhelming majority would agree that libertarianism, and socialism, have separate historical origins, even if the two can be compatible, and have even been merged into a separate ideology. It still doesn't change the historical origins of libertarianism and socialism. In fact, it'd be far easier to make an argument that classical liberalism was the biggest influence, and origin, of both libertarianism and socialism. Libertarianism as an ideology actually arises over a full century before socialism, as an ideology, or before Marx and Engels write the manifesto. But I could definitely point to some key people that influenced both ideologies (Jefferson, Paine, even Locke to an extent). 

As far as bitcoin/cryptocurrency/blockchain, and where it fits? You can honestly make a great case for both. It's often touted, and rightfully so, as a libertarian project. But you can just as easily display the inherent socialist qualities, and why it would appeal to socialists as well, particularly when focusing on the egalitarian nature of both. I actually ran a lecture on this, but it edible easy to link btc to socialism. I'm hoping to improve that lecture for future classes, and may even throw in libertarian connections if I can get away with it.

"Ok, so to use LN you open up a channel with another party locking up funds in that channel, transact all you want and when you're done, you settle and close the channel. That sounds great, but it quickly becomes expensive and a real pain to have a channel open with starbucks, another open with the grocery store, another open with the home depot, another....thats complicated and expensive.

So, we need an easier way...like a central hub that does those channels for us. Like a bank. Ok, so Bank of Bitcoin starts up, is funded with 1000 BTC on the blockchain. Now they can clear all these payments and confirm transactions. Cool. You, me and 998 of our friends open accounts each with the cash equiv of 2 BTC in them...Do those BTC actually exist? So long as they clear on the LN when transactions between end points happen, that's good enough. So long as all of us don't withdraw all of our BTC at the same time, that's also good enough. We have no way of knowing if BoB actually has the funds to cover it's accounts. 

No problem, right? Everything has to settle out when the channel is closed. What is the channels never close? What is channels are only between giant clearing houses like bitcoin banks or a new visa? You kinda need to trust that they have the funds they claim they do. So, it's not a trust less system anymore either.

I know, it seems harmless and like not a big deal...I guess in a way it kind of is...that's how our entire monetary system works right now. But the whole point of the public ledger of bitcoin was to make this scenario impossible.

However, you could find some similar influential people/ideologies in both socialism and libertarianism (Paine, Jefferson). So at best, somebody could say that both ideologies stemmed from some of the same people, but there's no way to point towards socialism as the influence/origin of libertarianism, no matter how well somebody can tie the two ideologies together today. It's just not how it happened. Are their connections between the two today? Yes. Did libertarianism come as a direct result of socialism? Absolutely not.

I wouldnt go through that level of work if I were peer reviewing, because it's not required - so wtf would I do it on reddit? Submit anything to go through the peer review process. Your findings will get chewed up and spit out, and they won't source any of it. They'll just tell you it's wrong, dribble, your sources suck, and doesn't deserve to be published in an academic journal (paraphrased). 

Edit: you're also confused about the meaning of the word ""claims."" OP made a claim about the origins of libertarianism. His claim goes against something that has reached consensus in academia.

"Do you honestly think our government doesn't do fucked up shit? Just because I served doesn't mean I can't criticize and be for transparency. I'm still failing to see the connection. ""The government doesn't like him so you shouldn't either."" is the most insane thing I've seen.

Would you sell all your bitcoins if tomorrow they said Satoshi was a terrorist? What if Satoshi is a Russian who has ties to the Kremlin? I don't expect you to answer that because I know the answer. You would likely say, ""Well they only hate Satoshi because he got in the way of muh FED."" Which is literally what the U.S government has done to every opponent, including people like MLK.

You are literally on a subreddit dedicated to a protocol that completely undermines the government because of a lack of trust for third parties and government officials/the FED. A lot of us are here for price, and a lot of us are here because we believe in the technology. Some of us are even here, like myself, because we love cryptography and what it can do for the world and cyber security. But we generally all agree that we want to control our own money independent from government.

Yet you want me to believe some fucking story that has yet to be proven that comes straight from said governments mouth. And at the same time accusing me of treason which is punishable by fucking death. I mean if you're here for the price, then cool. Just remember that by participating in bitcoin, you're completely going against the government.

It already happens now. A lot of politicians have said Bitcoin was used specifically for crime. Well there you go, the government has spoken. Time to sell all your bitcoin and be a good patriot :)

"Hm, but I thought they had to close out and settle. I thought it was set to 30 days or something like that. And unlike a bank, the LN can't run off with your BTC, because when you open a channel you get a magic TX that allows you to spend it and get all your money back after 30 days (I believe that's the timeframe). So there's no trust involved at all, unlike a bank. Worst case is you lose your money for 30 days.

I also thought LN had cross channel communication but a google search seems to indicate that I was confusing it with Ethereum's Sharding. 

I think LN could be useful for people shuffling around a lot of money, like maybe starbucks or ... hm. Well I'm sure there's use. I probably won't personally use it though since I rarely transact (like most people).

"I think you're right -- example:

""In the case of the NYMEX WTI contract, physical delivery is possible and entails delivery into the oil hub of Cushing, Oklahoma. ... In reality, very rarely does physical delivery take place in commodity futures.""

I think that every future, in the end, IS actually delivered for things like oil.

Just that if you really don't want to baghold it, you might have to sell it at a loss to someone who does want the actual oil, and is ready to take it off your hands. Otherwise, like a game of musical chairs, the music stops and the actual thing is delivered to the last person holding the future ;)

I think that a given future is counting down to it's delivery date though, and might pass back and forth between many hands, before the actual receiver gets it. They could buy the future and hold onto it all the way to the end obviously, but speculators might pass them around. One of those speculators could get unlucky and baghold it.

(edit, add:) if it can't be broken at this level, it's less likely that it could have been broken at a previous level, and it's almost certain that it's not worth breaking it at any level prior to that. so as the value increases, and it remains unbroken, it proves that's it not breakable for the value you could obtain by breaking it. the higher the value, and the longer it goes, the stronger the little bits of proof become. how big does the pot need to be until we just say, ""yea, at any level of value, for all practical purposes, this is not going to break?""

"Here's the answer you're looking for: 

1.) It doesn't, because borrowing money is mutually exclusive from banking. They simply have the means to do so with a lot of money for a lot of people.

2.) Borrowing money and services can be governed by smart contracts. This is one of the big breakthroughs of blockchain: The chain is the record book of what happens, and blocks of code (contracts) will facilitate the transaction if pre-agreed upon conditions are met. 

Banking relies on a lot of fat and waste and is operationally quite the behemoth. In theory, smart contracts would replace whole systems or teams of people that would require time, money, and energy to make sure a transaction is valid. So in theory, Blockchain cuts out a lot of middlemen and wasteful staffing and therefore the functionalities of a bank can all exist on a chain (distributed database) that no one entity can control or overwrite. 

The act of loans and services does not change, merely the means of which they can be fulfilled. ";1;2;False;Bag3l;drawtvh;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416

"Traditionally banks did this by lending other people's money and assuming that most of their customers would leave their money deposited.  If the majority of customers withdrew their money at once, called a ""bank run,"" then the bank would fold.  When that happened anyone who couldn't get their money out lost it all.  This was frequent during bank panics until the advent of things like FDIC insurance (in the US).

You could probably make a decent case based on Paine's Agrarian Justice, because he outlines a sort of libertarian-socialism (before any of these ideologies exist), but just looking at the history of the origins of both... just... no.

Absolutely. Read through my string of comments. I've basically been repeating this. They may both share some influences, borrow from similar earlier ideologies, etc. But my main point was simply pointing out that Op stated that libertarianism has its origins in socialism, which isn't true. I don't understand the maelstrom of bashing - this is well known, and easily accessible information. Just because it's easy to link the ideological origins of the two, does not mean that socialism served as the foundation and roots for libertarianism, or vice versa.

We believe the rich get rich via the sweat of our labor and we'll be goddamned if we let them turn us into their slaves as a wy to return the favor.

"If nothing, it will prevent massive misallocation of capital. Capital today gets allocated based on who you are and who you know, rather than how well you can utilize that capital for social good. Easy money leads to bubbles. The global economy today is a bubble on top of a bubble on top of an entire pyramid of bubbles. 

Many industries - particularly banking, finance, and insurance are not prepared for the onslaught that is coming. There will be new billionaires. However, they will be more in numbers, and a much larger percentage of them will have proven by their actions that they believe in decentralizing trust and power. 

The worst problem that the world faces today is that it is built on top of too many large institutes that have all become too big to fail - a consequence of compounding bad investments across multiple sectors. Something which only easy money can sustain for this long.

As someone said - Bitcoin isn't a bubble, it's the pin. 

Of course there will be more billionaires. Anyone who owns more than 10 bitcoin is a Satoshi billionaire. But there won't be just a handful of billionaires like we have today :)

Besides that, there really is no possible way to keep Wallstreet money from flowing into Bitcoin. I for one wouldn't want to stop it, because I want bitcoin to become widely adopted, which it never will be if it remains on the fringe forever.  Just because Wallstreet and Banks can put their money into bitcoin doesn't mean they'll have the power to manipulate it to the same degree that they manipulate stocks, especially when it grows so large where it starts absorbing the real estate and gold derivatives market (which is in the quadrillions of dollars) which I am betting it will.

"I still think equality should be programmed into bitcoin. The early adopters DID NOT build bitcoin, everybody built bitcoin by paying their taxes. Satoshi didn't build that, we all did. So higher balances of coin in addresses should slowly be distributed to lower balance addresses until there's an equal amount of coin in all active wallets.

Further, it's only a matter of time before coins have to start taking justice and fairness serious so we should start figuring out to work affirmative action into bitcoin. I thought that if miners were able to identify their race, then minority miners could have a better chance at solving blocks. And Asians should have a harder time solving blocks (same rules we use for the SAT). This would ensue racial fairness in bitcoin because right now it's so WHITE and that's the real problem.

I've sent a thousand emails to blockstream about all this. I'm thinking about starting a protest if anyone wants to help coordinate. If we don't make headway with bitcoin, I wrote up a whitepaper for a completely fair new coin that embraces justice and equal rights, I call it BernieCoin and if anyone can help me program it, we could go moon together.

"First let me say I got into crypto, especially Bitcoin, long before most people even knew what Bitcoin was, before we had pizzamemes. That said, although in economic ideology I was against the bailout, if the Federal Reserve did not bail out the banks our economy literally would of tanked to lows perhaps worse than The Great Depression. We've had a 10 year boom since then, perhaps some of it is artificial in the since that with cheap money people take risks they wouldn't normally take and with interest rates rising those risks can be exposed, as they should. But the United States literally has profited from the loan we gave the banks, they paid back in full+ interest, so we made money on the deal and saved the global economy from tanking to shit, which probably would of lead to WW3. 

People have this idea that you can't be for Bitcoin if you enjoy the benefits of fiat monetary systems. Even Milton Friedman, Frank Knight, and tons of Chicago Economist who really lead the free market campaign were for monetary policy just they didn't like the politics of the central bank. 
Under the gold standard we had more economic recessions and depressions due to not being able to control our own currency. One rich man sells his Gold and the whole thing can be tanked due to supply economics. You see the same thing with Bitcoin. If one of the Whales sells there entire Bitcoin assets, this whole thing could tank in minutes. Saw it with the Dot Com bubble in '99, and saw it with the housing crisis in 2008, one Investment bank sold all their balance sheet worth of CDO's for well below market value to everyone else on wall street and then it caused panic. The bank operated in self interest because it realized that it had all these worthless assets, and came to the conclusion so did everyone else, and that set off a chain event that launched rocket to blow the whole thing up. Whales can do the exact same thing if they act in self interest, which if they have any sign or reason to want to take their hundreds of millions and perhaps soon, billions, this will happen. The bitcoin community has this notion of how evil the Federal Reserve is, when in fact they don't even understand how the Credit market works, and how debt, ""credit"", has connected the global economy in such a way, that has essentially prevented WW3 among trading nations. 

Bitcoin is great, as I said I'm an early adopter, but I honestly feel bad for people who have been sold this lie that Bitcoin will erode Government and the banking system. I was a hardcore Libertarian with Anarchocapitalist leanings, still pretty Libertarian, I jumped down that Rabbit hole. Don't be blinded by ideological pandering by people who no less about how actual economies operate, and barely understand the tech or economic phenomena that is Bitcoin, Crypto and Blockchain.  Should their be alternative to banking? Sure. But Credit markets from banks are the safest way to spend money, they protect your assets, if someone access your bank account and steals your money, the bank has your back. If someone hacks into your cryptowallet and steals $60 million, cya! Crypto serves a purpose, but we are in the infancy of this tech, don't be blinded by economic exuberance. Invest safely friends.

"Assange's character is irrelevant to the fact that WikiLeaks is the only truth left in media, and he is not wrong about Bitcoin being the force that will actually bring down the banking and credit industry.  He's only saying the same thing as Andreas Antonopoulos, albeit as a concise one-liner.  Here is AA's longer more eloquent version about the 5 stages of grief that the banking industry will suffer.

You can still put money in a bank if you want. And they could still lend it out if you want. Gov could even still bail them out using taxpayer funds.

And you don't need that interest as badly because you are not using a non-inflating currency.

As an historian, and someone who just finished a socialism in America thesis:  no. Libertarianism was never a socialist concept. In fact, the two ideas are at odds with each other nearly every step of the way. Libertarianism's historical roots can be found in Classical Liberalism, not to be confused with today's meaning of liberal.  And libertarian socialism is something else entirely, so that's a poor argument and a useless wiki link. The two can be compatible, but the do not stem from one another historically. At best, you can claim libertarianism is an ideology that sprung from the left.

"Ok, then help me please to learn this. In fact, i have only one question. WHAT BITCOIN IS BACKED WITH? 
Dollar is backed with the US economy. “This note is a legal tender for all debts, public and private...” Every business or individual in the US is obligated by law to take dollars as payment for any good or service. 
You cannot start your “shitdollar” as an alternative currency and demand to take it as payment in your local 7-11 ;)
And the existing cryptocurrencies are backed with nothing except belief of some people in its value. Block chain is a great technology, but everyone can start their own crypto currency, and many do. They are called “shitcoins” and usually cost nothing.

"Call me crazy but in 2016 one political party rigged their primary. Overtly, publicly, then insulted their support base when they cried foul. Assange character remained unchanged, speaking truth to power where observable evidence of corruption exists. 

But that's a bitter pill to swallow, so I suppose it's easier to call out his credibility. I find this dismissal incredibly unethical as it's akin to stating, ""if you're not cheating you're not trying"". 

When elections are at state, the scale of meddling we saw requires lengthy jail sentences. Doing otherwise sends the message that transfer of power is effected solely through uncivil means. At that point all that's left are uncivil rule of strongmen and coercion. That's the worst outcome of this little exercise in brinksmanship we're playing. Not the legacy I'd accept leaving behind for my children.

we should fight back - both politically through protest and technologically through software
