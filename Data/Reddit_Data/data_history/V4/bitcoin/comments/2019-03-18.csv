"Why don’t you go look up how much this would cost and figure out the fees you’d need to charge even with $0 profit. There’s the cost of the rent, the machine, the internet connection, the exchange fees, the cost of thefts/vandalism, insurance, etc. There’s also the high cost of needing to hire armored security to come and empty out the cash from the machine on a regular basis, do you think armored trucks and security guards are free? 

Regular bank ATMs are subsidized by the bank because the bank makes their actual money off of all the money people deposit, not off the goddamn atm fee. The main reason they even charge atm fees is to convince folks to join their bank.

Bitcoin ATMs will always have high fees no matter what.

The only real way to get the fees down would be if all regular ATMs also offered Bitcoin exchanging as a bonus feature and they gave lower fees to their account holders. ";22;3;False;bittabet;eisq3nq;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg

"If the deposited money only covers the paid bitcoin, there are a lot of other cost not accounted for. Arguably currently the fees are higher than necessary for cost-recovery, but it can be, due to a lack of competition in the market.

A bitcoin ATM needs to be developed and built, it needs to be placed in a certain spot where maybe rent needs to be paid, it needs a hookup to electricity and internet, which is not free and it needs to be regularly serviced in person for the cash-side of things. All these things are not free and need to be calculated into the price of the product it sells (bitcoin) either due to fees or due to a higher-than-market exchange rate. Or a combination of both. Wanting everything free does not make it economically viable.

"I got a crypto non-profit (501c3) I'd be happy to loan for this purpose. I could set up a BTC donation, and any funds sent to this address could be set aside for this objective.

For legal reasons, funds would be distributed for 'education', meaning the code must be open sourced, etc, and for transparency all allocation of funds would be paid to people, not aliases (otherwise I could make an alias and steal all the funds).

My general preference is flat payment per person (X person makes *significant* contribution, now they get equal payment to everyone else) - this works well for charities to prevent millionaire management. For *business*, it actually works better to do like an X prize ($5,000 to first person to achieve X), which I'm open to as well - this *can* lead to corruption, however, as the code is open source and if it has many people participating, then the last man to put in the final line of code can swoop in and steal the entire prize : flat payment per person is much better for Open Source people systems (like governments, charities, etc).

""Digital Currency Conversions

With a Digital Currency Conversion, you can accomplish in a single transaction what would otherwise require two separate transactions. For example, you could directly convert Bitcoin to Ethereum (a Digital Currency Conversion), or you could sell Bitcoin and then purchase Ethereum (a Digital Currency Sale followed by a Digital Currency Purchase). 

Coinbase charges a Spread of one percent (1.00%) for Digital Currency Conversions. However, the actual Spread may be higher or lower due to market fluctuations in the price of Digital Currencies on Coinbase Pro between the time we quote a price and the time when the order executes. We do not charge a separate Coinbase Fee for Digital Currency Conversions.""

""The most important innovation that I have seen in the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine, that really helps people and prevents visits to the bank and it is a real convenience. (...)

I have had very little evidence that vast amounts of innovation in financial markets in recent years has had a visible effect on the productivity of the economy, maybe you can show me that I'm wrong. All I know is that the economy was rising very nicely in the 1950s and 1960s without all of these innovations. Indeed, it was quite good in the 1980s without Credit Default Swaps or CDOs. (...) In fact we had greater speed of growth in the 1960s and more importantly it did not put the whole economy at risk of collapse.""

That's non-sense. There are plenty of legitimate reasons. Some people will pay a premium for privacy, or the convenience of instant and on the spot acquisition of BTC. Or instant and on the spot conversion to fiat. What about the opportunity cost from the delay of signing up with an online exchange, and the delay in having your account verified (if you can even provide adequate information to satisfy KYC), which is then available to be plundered by hackers - are you so new to crypto you don't recall cavitex? https://www.databreaches.net/cavirtex-shutting-down-following-security-issues/), and then the 5 business days for a bank wire to clear to fund your account.. while the price is moving ~10%/day?

">One could argue that this trend toward everyone using card is going to make it way easier to transition to cryptos in our lifetime.

If people prefer cards over cash, when cash is anonymous, untraceable, fee-less and requires no 3rd party to transact, just because cash is slightly less convenient than card, why would that bode well for crypto?

People are clearly signalling they're happy to trust a 3rd party to have information on all their transactions, to have the power to block their transactions, and to pay fees for the privilege, in exchange for a bit more convenience.";2;1;False;suninabox;eisxq2y;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg

You think there is some kind of organized effort to bring down bitcoin? Are you fucking stupid? Last I checked it was bitcoiners manipulating the market and trying to push their bags on unsuspecting people. Seriously there is no organized resistance of FUDSTERs. There are definitely entities like Tether for instance actively manipulating the market to prop-up the value of bitcoin to keep their ponzi scheme running a little longer.
