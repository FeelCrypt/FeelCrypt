"I'm not an economist, but the finite amount of bitcoin is very different than a finite amount of fiat currency (if one existed). Fiat is only very coarsely divisible. Bitcoin at present is divisible up to 8 decimal places and a trivial software update could increase that divisibility.

The value one bitcoin can rise to an astronomical level, and it's smallest unit can still be subdivided. The same can't be said for any fiat currency.

If we were ever to see a single satoshi become more valuable than the smallest desired payment, a software update could simply take it on out to 12 decimal places, or 24, or 1000. All 21M bitcoin that will ever be in existence could reasonable represent all global wealth and still be traded in units equal to a fraction of a penny.

Bitcoin's value is way too volatile right now for it to function well as a currency. This is because it has yet to see mass adoption.

"It's always been a problem for lending because it increases rather than decreases the value of the loan, and it ends up discouraging borrowing (i.e., mortgages, business ventures) and encouraging savings over investment.

> By restricting loans for land purchasing, and the demand to pay loans in full, debtors were forced to sell off their property and real estate, which drastically dropped real estate and land prices. Paired with Tiberius' credit easing policy and the Senate naively demanding that people continue to invest in land despite what was going on, massive deflation occurred which ultimately cause the market to collapse.

"Let me rephrase that, he doesn't even seem to have an argument. He rambles a bit about finite amounts in a very meaningless way.

The only way you can keep mining gold is if you ignore the laws of physics. Gold isn't just rare on earth, it's rare in the universe. It takes some pretty unusual circumstances to produce gold atoms.

The fact that bitcoin is finite is not necessarily a good thing. The fact that fiat can be printed is not necessarily a bad thing. For a currency, it's a rather nice quality that it can be managed if done well and when necessary. For a currency, it's not so great if the total is immutable, even when units get lost.

Along the same lines, the immutability of math is utterly irrelevant considering you don't have to change the math, just the way the math is applied. For instance when developers develop, or fork to develop in different directions.

And there's yet another strawman. I've never claimed it to be a replacement for logic. You're the one that fail to recognize that ""pointing to unknowns"" does not in any way involve giving up on logic.

For example, we can apply Bayesian probability as an extension of propositional logic to assess the uncertainty of the unknown, as a means to quantifying and reasoning about hypotheses about the level of risk.

What is not logical is sticking your head in the sand and forget about the unknown risks because you can't precisely quantify all of them.

>  I'll take it you won't be presenting such a scenario where it would happen.

I did point out a potential risk scenario, but the entire point of an unknown risk is that you can not fully quantify it. If you could, it'd be trivial to insure against that specific risk, and it won't be a (financial) risk any more.

>If you are in a minority chain, is it possible to transfer your $ to a majority chain?

Well, the chains have the same history up until the block when they fork into separate chains, so you have the same balance in both unless you move funds _after_ the fork.

So for example, with Bitcoin Cash, on August 1st both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had the same history (same blocks) but then Bitcoin rejected the first block with more than 1MB and the Bitcoin Cash accepted it (they enforce different rules). 

From then on they are building on top of different blocks and what you do in one doesn't affect the other one, but the balance of all accounts on the moment of the fork is the same.

You can then sell what you have on one chain to buy more of the other if someone is willing to make the trade. So if you had 1BTC prior to August 1st you now have 1BTC + 1BCH and you can trade the 1BCH for xBTC and end up with 1+xBTC, x being whatever someone is willing to trade for your 1BCH.";1;0;False;ric2b;dot9jtt;Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak: “Bitcoin is mathematical.

The main chain isn't an objective thing, it's just the chain that most people decide that it has the rules they want and follow. Some Bitcoin Cash supporters say they are the main chain, for example, but they're a minority. 

I guess it's correlated with number of transactions but making thousands of fake transactions wouldn't make an unused chain the ""main chain"" in the eyes of anyone reasonable.

"> A predictable cash flow doesn't tell you much about the future of the business 

That is what predictable means, literally.

The value of a business is the sum of all it's future cash flows discounted back into the present time. If you can correctly predict those future cash-flows, you can perfectly predict the value. Of course value can never be measured to infinite precision because our ability to predict the future is very limited. What I'm trying to convey is the fact that markets go up and down without regard for any fundamental cause that would affect the future cash flows of a business. However, if the fundamentals of business change, the market will react and will tend to reflect the correct value of the stock over time. Price is an instantaneous property of the subjective trade interactions, whereas value is a precise quantity that exists at every moment but can only be measured in hindsight. For instance we can know almost exactly how much coca cola was worth 70 years ago, because today's cash flows discounted back 70 years are negligible. We can compare its value with the price at various times and find significant discrepancy between both quantities.

Price tends to accurately represent value in the long term, as the market averages what everyone's opinion of value is, and as everyone's opinion of such value becomes more and more informed. Since the fundamentals can change, and the value can change with the fundamentals, the markets are always chasing the correct valuation of an asset, but miss-pricing happens all the time, and the efficient market hypothesis is just a theoretical idealization that does not hold true in practice.";1;0;False;kazujii;dot2ozq;Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak: “Bitcoin is mathematical.

The value is always given by the market at the particular time because ""value"" is subjective for each market participant. A predictable cash flow doesn't tell you much about the future of the business the same way past performance is not indicative of future results. You can never be sure about the future thus you can't say Apple has value because they sold 10M iPhones last year even though their stock crashed 50% since (made up numbers).

An important point is that users/miners that don't change to the new software will keep following the old rules, so if the new rules are incompatible you get a fork (2 chains with different rules).

"B2X is not a small cash grab project like BTG to make a little money.  It's also not an ideological schism like BCH.  B2X wasn't even intended as a fork.  B2X was intended as a way to Bitcoin off the hands of  Bitcoin Core development team which has been leading Bitcoin development and progress until now.  

S2X already has 1/5 the value in futures trading where the coins are labelled BT1 and BT2 for instance.  With the Bitcoin Core supported coin  remaining labelled BTC, who the hell is going to buy a forked alt-coin called B2X?  The price disparity is going to be huge -- Hashpower will follow.  At least BCH has an ideological, almost religious cult that will buy BCH.  B2X has no user support.  Other exchanges will have similar stances and some already have.  

So the miners last play would be to mine a coin that hardly anybody is going to buy (B2X) and hope the hashpower in BTC is so lacking that it grinds to a halt to kill the chain.  How likely is that to happen?  Miners will jump to mine the chain where there is millions to be made. If they don't it's economic suicide.  I don't think it'll come to this.

If you want to understand the fork in November and why so many people are against it on a technical level [watch this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AecPrwqjbGw), [Then this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3PcR4HWJnkY).

As for your bitcoin on your Trezor, you don't have to do anything, your coins are safe, I would avoid making any transactions during the period of the November fork for a few days just to play it safe but in general you don't have to do anything, you've already taken the correct steps in securing your bitcoin on a hardware wallet.

As for bitcoin gold (BTG), where do I even start? This fork (in my personal opinion, I speak only for myself) feels very Scammy, most people think the fork already occurred a little while ago and most places I don't think are even supporting it. (read Coinbase statement on the BTG Hardfork.) 
I personally won't be taking the time to try and split BTC and BTG unless either Trezor or Ledger allow for them to be easily split like they did with BCash.
In any event though, even with your bitcoin still on your Trezor you still own coins on both chains.

"Giving it a go:
The bitcoin you have, doesn't really reside on your disk, or in your case coinbase' disks. All that owners of bitcoin has are keys to access/use the bitcoins, but in reality all the bitcoin exists on the blockchain - i.e. distributed to the whole world. Only you can spend them if you have the keys, but if you let coinbase hold your keys, you trust that they are doing the right things with them.

For some, that is ok - but most bitcoiners advocate being in full control yourself, i.e. owning your own keys.

But owning these keys also comes with a *great* responsibility. If you lose them (there are backups, but *be sure* to understand them), you actually lose your bitcoins. Technically, they exist, but *noone* can spend them without the keys. There are no ""administrators"" that can go and find your bitcoins. No, really! Noone!

Keys refer to the way bitcoin works. The only true way to know that you own and can spend bitcoin is to have the private key to your wallet. If you hold coin on Coinbase, you are entrusting them to hold the key and you never know what it is. That said, it's a safe place for new users and people that don't want to get into the nitty gritty of the security necessary to hold their own keys. If you lose the keys, you lose your bitcoin. There's no way to retrieve. Some of the hardware wallets, specifically Trezor, make it easier for you to do it right, though, if you do want to take control of your own keys. Just read their manual on their site and you'll learn a bunch more.  In my opinion, worth the $100 to store them on your own. ;1;0;False;GeekerDad;dot4v0j;"Coinbase: ""Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).""";78bh9v;https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2892985-segwit-2x-faq

I said from the start, if a few companies and miners can fork to change the rules of bitcoin without consensus (No social support, no Node support, no market support) then bitcoin has failed, a lot of people don't realise that this fork would set a precedent that if one country has majority hash rate its nation could strongarm its miners and CEOs into taking bitcoin into an alternative direction, it could happen and us not even know it's being manipulated by a government (not saying B2X is a government attempt but just saying future attempts could be made possible)

"Yes, that's correct. Just be aware that all of that should be done **after the fork**. The only thing you need to do pre-fork is make sure you're holding your Bitcoin in a wallet that allows you to export your private keys (or, if you're feeling brave, trust someone like Coinbase to manage it all for you - pro tip: don't do this).

And for the avoidance of doubt, in order to claim whatever the forked coin is you will need the private keys for the bitcoin wallet that held your Bitcoin *at the time of the fork*. You can do whatever you want before and after the fork, but the fork effectively freezes the other bitcoin version of that wallet until you act on it.

Think of it like copying a password protected file on your computer. Once you've copied it you can change either copy completely independently of the other yet they both use the same password (your private key).

"To clarify:  

Coinbase is insured *for USD balances* that are stored on your account (which are actually stored in a regular custodial bank account which is FDIC insured like any other bank account).  

Coinbase is insured *for online cryptocurrencies* that are stored in hot wallets.  This accounts for about 5% of all of their cryptocurrency assets.

Coinbase is NOT INSURED *for offline cryptocurrencies* stored in cold storage.  If their cold storage funds are lost, they will have to repay us from their own capital, which may take a long time.  Granted, their cold storage solutions are likely the most secure in the industry (we're not just talking about a few multi-sig hardware wallets here, theirs is likely on a whole different level).  It would probably take some massive social engineering, or a LOT of really disgruntled employees for their cold storage to be comprimised.  So its easy to imagine that given a choice of spending capital on insurance for their cold-storage funds, vs spending the same amount on legit security of their cold-storage funds, that they would want to go with the latter, and pour money into security over time.

"Even after all this time dude?  Seriously?  Wow.

Because the number of nodes is only peripherally important( peering and routing ).  What is important is **what node is used to record transactions on the blockchain**.  The nodes that are used to sign and, more importantly, receive transactions.  It is what node is used to interact with the blockchain that defines the consensus rules that the node user is prepared to accept.  Nodes that people don't use are just lines on a graph.  If you can't convince the people using their nodes to make transactions to adopt different consensus rules, you don't have consensus, so ya got nuffin.

"The more I read this the more unclear it seems to be written.  

Version 1:  

>All digital currency **that Coinbase holds online** is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach **of its online storage**, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.  

Further down:  
>Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online.  

And then version 2, a different line:  

> The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.  

So which is it?  Only online (2%, which is basically nothing), or everything in every form?  Whether you're right or I am, I don't really care... as long as we get to the bottom of this.

You pay for the convenience by not being able to set the price you want to buy/sell at and through higher fees on deposits/withdrawls (up to 4% but have a structure that changes fees depending on a couple factors)

There are a lot of people out there that would be intimidated by something like GDAX.  Most investors don't hop on scott trade or where ever and place limit orders for stocks and funds, instead they call up their ""guy"" at Wells Fargo, Schwab, JP Morgan and say buy me some of X stock.

"I forced myself to get my old coins sorted after the whole Bitcoin cash thing. If you want to 'separate' your coins:

**After the fork (wait a week or two or whenever the subreddit says the dust has settled)**

* Backup your wallet.dat and/or private keys.

* In your BITCOIN wallet, send your coins to a new address. Let that shit get some confirmations.

* Once that's done, download a wallet that supports S2X

* Import your (Old, now empty) Keys or wallet.dat into that S2X wallet. Holy shit you still have coins there wtf woo!

* Sell those S2X coins on an exchange, get your free money.

"No. You need one wallet, that holds your current Bitcoins, that allows you to export your private keys. Then, at some point **after the fork** you need to find a wallet that supports the forked coins that also allows you to import private keys (I can't imagine any that wouldn't allow you to do this). This *might* be the same wallet but is more likely to be a different one.

A good example that you can work through is for Bitcoin Cash. [This annoyingly formatted article](http://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-claim-bitcoin-cash-bcc-using-the-electron-cash-wallet) explains the process to claim Bitcoin Cash using Electrum and Electron Cash (which is a fork of the Electrum Wallet). Note that the first few steps of downloading Electrum isn't necessary - the point they're trying to make is that you should empty the wallet of bitcoin before exporting the private keys because if someone gets hold of these keys, they have all your bitcoin.

"Need clarification please-

Are people going to send all their BTC on coinbase or GDAX in order to have an equal amount of BX2 conveniently  created?

Extracting BCH from BCH was time consuming for me, so I'm confused with the fact that coinbase will split B2X for us.

Thought we were never supposed to keep coins on exchanges.

Anyway-- is anybody planning to deposit their BTC on coinbase or GDAX to  get the B2X split?

"Yes it's because 2x wanted to be referred to simply as BTC. That's because being known to the world as Bitcoin is a valuable thing (that's why the owner of Bitcoin.com refers to his preferred altcoin as ""Bitcoin"" although it's not the real Bitcoin). If there's anything else in a coin's name beyond ""Bitcoin"" or ""BTC"" it means it's not going to hold the value of original Bitcoin. BCH, and BitcoinXT for example....

You basically have to get a shitcoin wallet and sweep your BTC private key and get your shitcoin. I wouldn't do anything for few months. Right now shitcoin is worth $800 per shit coin. Maybe shitcoin might go up. Maybe not. Don't be in a hurry to spend or sell your shitcoin. 

Hold for a while and see how things shake down. Then you can decide what to do.

I agree. My point, which you missed because you are so arrogant, antagonistic, and dense, was that Bitcoin growth will only continue to accelerate, so arguments about the trivial cost of a node are not going to cut it.

>* Approximately 24 hours pre-fork. Coinbase will temporarily disable all bitcoin buy, sells, sends and receives. ETH and LTC will not be impacted. You will still be able to see your Bitcoin balances and monitor the price. If you plan on moving BTC into your Coinbase account, we highly recommend that you do so at least 24 hours before the fork to ensure your transfers are confirmed.

>* Fork (block 494,784). Any Coinbase customer with a confirmed Bitcoin balance at this point will be credited an equal amount of Bitcoin2x.

>* **Within 24 hours post fork. Coinbase customers will be able to buy and sell both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x. When you visit Coinbase.com or open your Coinbase app, you will see your new Bitcoin2x balance (in Accounts).**

>* Approximately 24–48 hours post fork. Once we have ensured that the blockchains are stable, Coinbase will re-enable Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x sends and receives.

"If you have Bitcoins in a hardware wallet at the time of the fork your hardware wallet will have both coins. Your ability to safely access both coins will depend on whether the software you use to access your hardware wallet supports both coins.

The biggest issue you have to watch out for is replay: Initially your coins on both chains look identical. If you spend one of the coins someone could replay the transaction on the other chain and your other coins will be sent as well.

Don't do anything with your coins after the fork until you split them to make them look different to the two chains. Google the name of your hardware wallet and something like ""coin splitting"" or ""replay protection"" to find out how to do it for your wallet.

Two differing schools of thought. Block size increases by themselves don't scale well to Visa and MasterCard levels. But multiple off chain layers can. So it's a temporary fix that will bring a permanent downside. On the opposing side.

That would depend on where your coins are stored. If they aren't in a paper wallet or with coinbase, I would check with the provider of your software/hardware wallet.

The evidence from previous forks shows us Bitcoin has always recovered. If you believe in bitcoin and are here long term, the important thing to remember is short term drops in value aren't bad, they're just a chance to buy more at a cheaper price. You've only lost money if you sell your bitcoin. If the new coin is treated as a chance for people to sell, I imagine many will reinvest that money into more bitcoin and we will see the price continue to rise.;1;0;False;Fampini;dot8003;"Coinbase: ""Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).""";78bh9v;https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2892985-segwit-2x-faq

The best strategy is to withdraw your funds to the blockchain before the fork. Then you'll get all your fork coins automatically, with no effort on your part.;2;1;False;bytevc;dotdmtf;"Coinbase: ""Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).""";78bh9v;https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2892985-segwit-2x-faq
Coinbase is a custodial service, like a Bitcoin bank, where your funds are with Coinbase. Trezor is a wallet where you control the keys and your funds are on the blockchain.

That would be a big decision for you to make. A lot of people advise not to permanently store your coins on coinbase. You are putting your money out of your control (imagine if a government ordered them to block all accounts). Remember the key is to always minimise risk. You will have access to the new coin if you store offline too. If you do choose to store offline I would recommend using the guides about paper wallets or hardware wallets first.;1;0;False;Fampini;dot82qi;"Coinbase: ""Following the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X).""";78bh9v;https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2892985-segwit-2x-faq
