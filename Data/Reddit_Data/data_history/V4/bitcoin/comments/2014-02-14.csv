"Yup, HD-DVD went the porn route, which is why plenty of people, at least at first, predicted HD-DVD to win the war (there was other factors such as it was cheaper to retrofit a conventional DVD assembly line to HD-DVD than Blu-Ray but porn was a major factor). I thought we were watching history repeat itself; VHS beat out Betamax (a clearly superior technology) because the porn community (as in both industry and the moms and dads at home making their own xxx movies for themselves) embraced VHS almost exclusively. But, this time, several factors came into play. One, the licensing/exclusiveness wars for different studios very early started going in Blu-Rays favour, and it's one of those things, where once Studio A and Studio B go over, then Studio C is very leery about going with HD-DVD. Secondly, and this was very smart of Sony, they included a Blu-Ray player in their PS3. So, you had a choice, buy a stand-alone Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player for $350 minimum, more likely over $400, or kick in another $150-200 and get a video game console as well (these prices are approximate, I am going from memory from what stuff cost me in Canada at the time). And thirdly, high def porn on physical media didn't catch on that well, or at least not as well as some expected. Porn was already transitioning to the interwebs, so now there was a cheaper, easier, less embarrassing and more personalized method to get porn. And, people were finding that they didn't really care for porn in 1080p; pornstars can look stunning in 480, and really lose some of their luster in full high def when you can make out which pimple on her ass is about to burst later that night.";1;0;False;the92playboy;cfeyoox;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

"It's not a disaster but it's bordering on it. I'm not new here. I've been here long enough to know that the last time these flash crashes happened Bitcoin wasn't under the watch of the mainstream eye. Major companies weren't on the verge of considering taking Bitcoin as payment. 

Things are different now. Every time things like this happen now it's exponentially worse than the last time it happened. So while the  previous crashes like Feb 2012 or a few times during 2013 might have done more damage to the overall price, this dive is causing a significant amount more collateral damage. 


EDIT- Don't try to patronize people with the phrase ""you must be new here"". Most of the people I see saying that are a lot of talk but don't really understand what they are saying.

Well you could google up a better explanation than I can give you.  I read about it and I think I maybe probably understand it but maybe I don't. :)  From my understanding the problem is that there's these transaction ids which are from the exact arrangement of the transaction, but then you don't have to have the private keys to make another different similar transaction, you can rearrange the same private parts into a different arrangement.  Or something, I'm vague on the details.  But anyway the details have been well known in general to people implementing such things, so it's been understood that you shouldn't rely on just that transaction id that's not foolproof, but gox did anyway because it was a lot easier.  If you don't just assume the transaction stays the same, you have to check not whether exactly the same transaction you sent exists, but whether there's any similar transaction (same time, same amount, same destination).  So Bitcoin isn't broken exactly, it's just crappy beta software you need to be careful to work around the issues in, like always.;1;0;False;mungojelly;cffe24f;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

They would have to have enough of an advantage to kick the first mover out of its seat. And that would be pretty amazing considering all of the massive advantages bitcoin offers over traditional currency and markets. It would be akin to creating another internet, email, or cellphone.

"I'm going to work on the assumption that the reason Bitcoins are half your portfolio is that they've increased in value a great deal. The other possibility is that your other investments imploded, but let's imagine that this is the ""good"" problem.

If you really wanted to commit to managing your risk, converting those Bitcoins to a less risky investment would be the right thing to do.  Simply sell Bitcoins until they again represent 2% of your portfolio. 

It would also be worthwhile to reexamine your risk assessment. Are Bitcoins a less risky investment than your 2% figure implies? Maybe instead, you have more risk tolerance than you thought.

Now, I'm sure as heck not a financial planner and I own 0.01 Bitcoins, so take all this with a big scoop of salt (unless you're in Georgia, where you need to conserve your salt).

"Uh, not ludicrous.  Studying the effects and markets created by technology is far different from studying the technology itself.

Being able to keep prices the same isn't an awesome useful thing, it's a clear sign that the whole system is being kept inefficient in order to keep that one variable steady, for no real reason, just convenience / old fashionedness / opportunities to shaft people. :/ ;1;1;False;mungojelly;cffbilh;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif
"I'll illustrate with a hypothetical. Yes, anyone who does this would be stupid, but it's just to clearly illustrate that your assertion isn't universally true.

I have a $20k tax bill on my inherited $1mil house due in 2 months. This house represents 95-99% of my assets and also is my place of business. I would be absolutely ruined if I lose my house (This is key). I have the exact amount saved, no other savings, and my other expenses equal my income. I need that $20k in savings to keep my house. I learn about this totally awesome investment that is ""sure"" to double by next month, so I hand over my $20k. A month goes by and I've lost 20% of the investment. The investee offers to return the remaining $16k or to let it ride. I've also learned some things that make me less sure of the investment. 

Now let's pause. Yes, I've been an utter moron, but that's not relevant to the question: What is the rational course of action?

If the analysis now tells me that there is only a tiny chance that I'll recover my $20k investment by next month and an immense chance that I will lose more, your assertion would suggest that I should pull out. However, if I do, I won't be able to pay my tax bill next month. I would lose my house and my livelihood. I'd be in the poorhouse for sure. The rational choice is to cross my fingers and hope that I can escape with at least as much as I invested.

At $690, 2% is a low end risk. If the bubble bursts, you only lose 2% of your portfolio. If it somehow goes up above $2000 in the next year plus, you're playing with profit and can do what you wish with it.";1;0;False;;cffdw6i;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

False.  Economists don't know shit about peer to peer networks.  They don't know shit about open source software, or digital payment systems, or network protocols.  They don't know shit about coming to a consensus in a distributed system, and they don't know shit about cryptography.  You cannot understand Bitcoin *at all* unless you have a good grasp on all these concepts, and most economists don't.  Period.    

Exhibit A:

>Paul Krugman in 1998:
""The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'–which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.""

*Economists do not understand technology*

Bitcoin doesn't fit into any of the models that economists have created.  It has never been done before, and nothing even close to it has ever existed in human history.  Economists have predicted that Bitcoin would fail several times already, and yet it keeps on defying them.

 [**Logarithmic growth**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logarithmic%20growth): [](#sfw)

>In [mathematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), **logarithmic growth** describes a phenomenon whose size or cost can be described as a [logarithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) function of some input. e.g. y = C log (x). Note that any logarithm base can be used, since one can be converted to another by a fixed constant. Logarithmic growth is the inverse of [exponential growth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth) and is very slow.

>A familiar example of logarithmic growth is the number of digits needed to represent a number, N, in [positional notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation), which grows as logb (N), where b is the base of the number system used, e.g. 10 for decimal arithmetic. Another example is in [cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), where the [key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography\)) size needed to protect against a [brute force attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force_attack) for a certain period of time grows logarithmically with the desired protection interval.

>In the design of computer [algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), logarithmic growth, and related variants, such as log-linear, or [linearithmic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearithmic), growth are very desirable indications of efficiency.

>**Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf** ([Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): محمد سعيد الصحاف‎ Muḥammad Saʿīd Al-Ṣaḥḥāf; born 1940) is a former [Iraqi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq) [diplomat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat) and [politician](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician). He came to wide prominence around the world during the [2003 invasion of Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), during which he was the [Iraqi Information Minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Information_Minister) under Iraqi president [Saddam Hussein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein), acting as the spokesperson for the [Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Socialist_Ba%27ath_Party_%E2%80%93_Iraq_Region) and Saddam's regime.

>He is best known for his grandiose and grossly unrealistic [propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) broadcasts before and during the war, extolling the invincibility of the [Iraqi Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army) and the permanence of Saddam's rule. His announcements were intended for an Iraqi domestic audience subject to Saddam's [cult of personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) and total [state censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship), and were met with widespread derision and amusement by Western nationals and others with access to up-to-date information from international media organizations. In the US he was popularly known as **Baghdad Bob**, in the UK as **Comical Ali**, and in Italy as **Alì il Comico**.

You don't even have to hold it for the moments it would take you to resell it-- you resell it *before* accepting it, or buy volatility insurance, or however you want to work/describe it.  Everyone always holds whatever they want for investment purposes, while also being able to instantly transact in whatever's convenient to transact in.  You hold whatever coin you feel is going ""to the mooooooooon"" and then when it's time to buy something you convert it to whatever its convenient for your merchant to accept-- that is if you haven't been able to convince your merchant to take your favorite coin and join you on your moon trip. ;)";1;0;False;mungojelly;cffh46z;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

"I think the answer is 'no.' But if you understand the revolutionary ability of the BTC technology--then it shouldn't faze you. Here's why:

1. this is an opportunity for many many developers to collaborate and solve the problem that was more/less ignored--developing increasingly better solutions...just like the Internet. I remember a time when people were afraid to buy things over the Internet, for fear of identity theft (some people still are)--but eCommerce is a huge industry now and not buying things online has become an enormous inconvenience.

2. The reason that, in the long run, BTC won't fail is because it carries the potential to reshape finance to become a forum of open source development. Just as the Internet reshaped mass-media to allow anyone to be a contributor (and profit from it!), so too will BTC change the way commerce happens.

Is it possible that another ""digital currency"" will come along that's better than BTC? Quite possibly, but crypto currency is here to stay.

>Controversy about currency [speculators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation) and their effect on currency devaluations and national economies recurs regularly. Nevertheless, economists including [Milton Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) have argued that speculators ultimately are a stabilizing influence on the market and perform the important function of providing a market for [hedgers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance\)) and transferring risk from those people who don't wish to bear it, to those who do. Other economists such as [Joseph Stiglitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz) consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.

"Mallability is not a problem for the protocol. Both the original and the changed transaction have the exact same effect, the same coins are transfered from the same addresses to the same address.

The problem is that it changes the hash of the transactions and some people use this hash as a unique identifier of the transaction, which is stupid since it's been known for almost 3 years that it's mallable.";1;0;False;hvidgaard;cff2yr6;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif
"There is no flaw in the protocol per se. This is instead a problem with the implementation of the software. Look up Transaction ID Malleability for technical details. It has a few symptoms. For normal clients, like the one on your computer, the only error you'll see is that after sending a transaction your balance sometimes doesn't seem to go down. This is just an illusion. If you try to spend these illusory coins, your transaction will fail. The illusion goes away once your initial transaction has enough confirmations.

This isn't a very big problem. I didn't even notice. The bigger problem was at Mt Gox. Their custom (read: shitty) software didn't handle this very well, and kept failing some of the transactions used in customer withdrawals because it tried to send illusionary coins. This prompted Mt Gox to freeze withdrawals until they figured out their software. This prompted a shitstorm.

IMO, this isn't the biggest technical problem bitcoin has faced. I think the split in the blockchain sometime last year was more serious. I remember everyone acting like the sky was falling. But then they fixed it and everyone calmed down overnight.

"1. Fiat and crypto trend separately. Fiat>Coin when it is low; Coin>Fiat when it is high.
2. Follow the volatility in markets you are most familiar with, so that you can recognize current conditions - is it going to blow by support/resistance this time or bounce off it... 
3. To day trade crypto, a percent gain covers fees and withdrawals, so it only takes a percent or two to realize actual profit. You may get lucky and realize much more than that at times, but that isn't the goal of the smart day trader - the day trader wants confident, consistent gains. They are generally low yield percentage profits, but also lower risk positions where a lot of potential profit I left on the table - get in after the trend is confirmed, and get out before the trend reverses eliminating your profit. Getting in at that ideal point and out at that ideal point may happen by chance from time to time, but it is the wrong goal to aim for.

Most people look at the graphs and want to hit the highs and lows. Most people aren't all that smart either. Most people lose money doing this.

Thanks. I don't really care about downvotes. As soon as a sub gets big enough, the disagreement downvotes come flying in. There is nothing I just said that was wrong. The price of bitcoins and the size of the economy it can support are correlated in several ways, and some of those are related to the velocity of money. The idea that bitcoin can be used for significant economic activity, without a sufficient money stock, is incorrect.

I don't think that is necessarily true.  As more and more stores accept bitcoin, the technology to convert fiat-->Bitcoin-->fiat will likely improve (as it would have to if vendors cannot stomach the potential losses due to volatility), thus reducing the time it takes to actually convert the currency and reducing the amount of bitcoin that is tied up in these float periods.

"Why do you think the price of bitcoin matters for its usability?  Perhaps the penny vs million dollars comparison is too broad, but on a slightly smaller scale, it really doesn't matter to anyone using bitcoin for anonymity whether the bitcoin is worth 10 dollars or 10,000 since you are converting fiat to bitcoin, paying, and then the recipient is converting the bitcoin back to fiat. 

I don't think acceptability will affect the value of bitcoins, no.  No one wants to hold bitcoins unless they are speculators and thus the supply of bitcoins will be used for anonymous commerce but won't be held by anyone other than speculators.  Rubies are a bad analogy in this case because they have inherent beauty and thus have value themselves.  Bitcoins aren't beautiful nor can you use them for anything other than as a medium for payment and thus only has value as long as speculators are willing to hold them.  For the bitcoin price to go up, you need more speculators buying them.  Even if every online store accepted bitcoin do you think people would convert all their hard-earned dollars to bitcoin to buy things online?  What would be the point of that?  Do you think that average people will buy and hold bitcoins just to watch the value of their hard work yo-yo incessantly?  

Perhaps there will be another reason to use bitcoin in the future, but for right now we don't urgently need to replace fiat currencies and therefore I don't see widespread acceptability itself driving the price of bitcoin higher.";4;1;False;BaxBak;cffczjq;Trying to trade these markets...;1xw5l0;http://i.imgur.com/DQ121sM.gif

My strategy: be the market maker on localbitcoins and don't pull out on high volatility. The likelihood of others panic-selling/buying and doing it wrong is high, it provides liquidity and I can take a 5% fee. But be careful to put the right formula in, as relying on just one exchange will most likely get you to have to honor deals that are definitely bad. For example I take the 24h high of stamp, gox and btcchina into account before applying a fee.;0;0;False;giszmo;cffd7wj;Trying to trade these markets...;1xw5l0;http://i.imgur.com/DQ121sM.gif
