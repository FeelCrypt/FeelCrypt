"Man, if I had all the answers, I would have retired long ago and just gone out to live my life :)

But I do think it's wise to ""hedge one's bets"".  But investing is not a one-time activity.  Keep pouring money into anything you believe is a sound investment.  You could sit on those stock shares (though $100 will not buy much of either company -- Amazon is over $1500), but $100 in any stock is not going to fund college for the kids.  Bitcoin might, because it's highly speculative.

For a long time, people have said Bitcoin will either go to $1M or go to $0.  They might be right.  It's been quite an interesting rollercoaster ride so far.  Sadly, it's one I can't really stomach.  I'll just have to sit on the sidelines and watch everyone go bust or get rich. :)

"When I said ""FRN"", I'm referring to Federal Reserve Notes -- i.e., the US Dollar.

When I started out, I was flat broke and married. Not a great situation, but I didn't worry about it.  I just didn't take on debt.  I worked and paid rent.  I recall vividly not even having spare change for a Coke.

After getting stable employment, my colleague told me something I'll never forget.  He didn't create the expression, but I forgot who said it originally.  What he said was, ""Cash in the bank is the slowest way to go broke.""  He encouraged me to invest.  I also _understood_ compounded growth, but I never really ""played with the numbers"".

I finally sat down one day when I was 31 and decided, like you, ""I'm fucked.""  I had a good job, but nothing substantial in savings; one good vacation could have wiped me out.  Literally, this was 8 years I let go by and ignoring my colleague's advice.

I created a spreadsheet similar to this one:
https://1drv.ms/x/s!ApUTJoy2I-2mjFBFYfYD_vbjN04W

I got it.  It clicked.  And I've been diligently putting money aside ever since.

Feel free to copy it and play around with the numbers.  The earlier you start, the more prepared you'll be for retirement.  Sadly, far too many Americans (and I suspect others around the world) assume the government will be there to support them.  It's not a great retirement when you're squeezing pennies like you have to do when you're young, especially when it even hurts to squeeze pennies.

I'm nowhere near retirement, yet, but I'm well on my way to meeting my goal of not being broke when that day comes.  And as I get older and I see my own parents, aunts, uncles, etc. entering retirement and complaining about how little Social Security is, I feel even better about the fact I didn't wait too late.

And if you get get into the habit, you'll feel far less stressed about money, since you'll have some in case there really is an emergency.";2;1;False;paulej;dz5vilu;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg
"> Store of value  
> Means of exchange  
> Unit of account  


I am neither an economist nor a historian, but the articles/books I've read on that topic (Nick Szabo articles, as well as [The Bullish Case For Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) and [The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)) suggest that an item first becomes a collectible (for its particular properties, usually such as scarcity, durability, fungibility, divisibility, transportability etc etc), then store of value, then medium of exchange and then unit of account.  

Obviously it's not a clear, linear progress, but an evolution nevertheless. An item doesn't become all three (SoV, medium of exchange, unit of account) over night and doesn't acquire these status at the same time.  

edit: maybe I missed your point a little, as you don't seem to argue agains the ""gradual process"" theory, but rather that we have to satisfy ""means of exchange"" point. I think it will arise quite naturally, as long as merchants are valuing bitcoin enough that they incentivize their customers to pay them in bitcoin. So if the ""store of value"" thing is fulfilled, the means of exchange will follow naturally, because bitcoin is well suited for that. Of course it's not yet perfect, but it evolves and there's a lot of development happening.";2;1;False;TheGreatMuffin;dz6kdmi;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

Because that's how Satoshi programmed it. 

Also, because it doesn't lead to malinvestments into stocks and real state, because under a Bitcoin standard it would only make sense to invest in solid businesses capable of generating free cash flows.

2% inflation is a tax and leads to the misalocation of capital. Plus, wages don't always move in line with inflation, thus eroding the middle class' purchasing power.

The only valid criticism would be that under a Bitcoin standard people would stop taking loans. This would be a problem for small businesses, but one that could perhaps be overcome by a mechanism similar to Treasury Inflation Protected Treasuries, tracking inflation.";1;1;False;deselby_III;dz6pjls;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg
"What's wrong with a wage going down if the value the person is being paid is still going up due to the currency being more valuable? It's all relative, there is no inherent reason for it being bad other than the coloring your modern lenses give the situation.

If wages don't go down then people are constantly becoming more wealthy. Sure it isn't great for corporations, I'll give you that, but it is certainly good for people.

What about savings accounts? Deflation encourages savings because your money will be worth more in the future. If banks are no longer allowed to fractionally reserve they will actually need to raise interest rates to encourage people to save with them. This again is good for the people.

The US already imports practically everything anyways so this only helps increase our purchasing power. The service industries can't be farmed out so it's not like those will crash. People will still use them but pay less, which won't be a problem because those companies will be able run on ""less"" money.

I'd honestly like a response that speaks as to why the current policies are inherently good. You can claim that the economy has been stable, but is that a causation of slight inflation, or a correlation with the items we have valued as a society as well as having the benefit of low cost labor in developing countries? There is a lot of moving parts to explain the stability of the American economy with, a simple argument of saying slight inflation causes it is the most ridiculous statement to make without any evidence to tie them together.";8;0;False;kmcclry;dz6j3ir;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

"I agree with the gradual process theory. I think where we might differ is that I believe BTC already had its chance to evolve into a true means of exchange. The store of value has always existed with Bitcoin because of its capped supply along with the inability to forfeit the printing/ownership of new coins. When people actually started using Bitcoin for daily transactions we hit the ""means of exchange"" point until the blocks became full. Once that occurred Bitcoin reverted to being a ""store of value"" with no means of exchange and lost points in ""unit of account"".

"As I understand it (from 10,000 meters away)...

First there was Bitcoin.  Then Bitcoin developers and miners had disagreements about how the project should move forward.  Rather than continue to have the debates, make concessions, and reach a consensus, people just went their separate ways and Bitcoin code was forked.

Now we have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, with supporters in each camp claiming that _they_ are users of the _real_ Bitcoin.  They had disagreement with each other before the fork and they have disagreements after the fork.  Both sides will say the other is illegitimate (or use stronger language).

Both have value, because the camps appear to be fairly sizably split.  Plus, those who had Bitcoin before the hard fork own both BTC and BCH now, and most people just do not care.  That helped immediately create value in the new coin.  If I were to go fork Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the same way, it might also be successful.  After all, there will be a fairly large number of people who would say, ""Cool!  I own Bitcoin-α coins now!""

IMO, the rivalry is destructive to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  Each side is trying to move forward, while bashing the other side.  Not everyone is, of course.  Some just view these as more-or-less the same as Litecoin or any other coin, buying and selling in hopes to make a profit.  However, I think the rivalry is helping to potentially derail Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general.  How can the general public trust either?  How can they be sure there will not be another fork and they just lose their money due to disagreement among developers and users?";2;1;False;paulej;dz68k98;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

>Cash in the bank is the slowest way to go broke

>He encouraged me to invest.

When I think about investments I think you need to have some money like $10K or something on the side. I'm not at that stage myself, but I'm about to be a full time web developer/freelance on the side/hopefully in time I'll get out of debt/start saving/get to that point.

I see your point in the spreadsheet too, I mean $2,500 is not much(to me it is, I don't even have that after taxes/debt settlement obliterated my savings)

But I also think I want to live in the moment/young... but as mentioned I'll get old too, so do both right... think about the inevitable(old).

>Sadly, far too many Americans (and I suspect others around the world) assume the government will be there to support them. 

I get that man. That's why I'm on the side of ""build SaSS products"" businesses/develop content(youtube videos or whatever)/blogs/publish books that sort of thing. Also just be skilled so you're worth something. Live within your means.

Once I get out of this rut that I've been in I fucking hope I don't forget how retarded I was/still am.

> you'll feel far less stressed about money, since you'll have some in case there really is an emergency.

yeah that's the plan man, save months/year(s) of living expenses. Currently as a single person I can survive on like $10-$20k/year but I f'd myself with school/credit cards/phone... My school loans accrue like $2-3K per year... they're on hold for now... but man. In the grand scheme my price tag of $50K roughly is not much but yeah... will take a little time.

People tell you too like ""Don't do this, don't be a fuck up"" and you still do it... hahaha I don't understand.

Is this not what my last section said? The keyword here is ""wisely"". Professional stock pickers don't beat the market in the long run, so it's unlikely causal investors like you and I will. If you have very in-depth knowledge of a market and can invest wisely, then I completely agree, that will be more lucrative, but that's atypical.

Honestly, the best bet is a indexed mutual fund. It invests in stocks but does so in a way that both diversifies and pegs it to the stock market's average performance. You save money because you're not paying fees for a stock picker, while it still performs about the same on average as a managed fund.";2;1;False;GrabAHamLincoln;dz606f5;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

"> Bottom line: nearly any investment is better than holding FRNs.

That's not true at all. For every Coca-Cola or Microsoft there are 10000 other stocks that went no where or failed and became delisted. It's a rather sneaky trick the exchanges play, because if you've ever analyzed stock price data, it probably won't include delisted stocks, causing you to form a survivorship bias where you think every stock is successful. They're not. Stocks become worthless all the time and the exhanges memory-hole them.

That's not to say abandon the stock market and buy gold. If you understand an industry and have confidence in a particular investment, then yes, it may very likely be a better investment, but in no way is ""nearly every investment"" better than gold. If that were true, no one would ever invest in gold. It's simply lower risk, but also a lower return.";96;3;False;GrabAHamLincoln;dz5mjgb;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

">Good investments will rise and, on average, most investors in the stock market see an 8% return on investment. 

Historically, maybe. But the 8% average return is predicated on the idea of economic growth, which was much more easily obtained back then than it is now.

Consumers are tapped out as we enter the endgame phase of monopolistic consolidation by the likes of Amazon.

Stocks keep going up because of blatant market manipulation and price suppress in the PM market.

 I mean, the Bank of Japan OWNS 75% of the ETF market and a decent stake in a number of companies. 

The Fed does it too, through proxy vehicles like the Swiss National Bank. How's that a free market?

What the fuck are you talking about, cynical is assuming it's actually important and necessary to the extent it's pursued and sought after. The actual market price has more to do with the cost of mining than real demand or usage. If gold was truly scarce and there was a possibility that industrial uses would completely deplete reserves any time soon it woud be far more valuable and jewelry made of it uncommon, like platinum ore. Even platinum is relatively abundant though, as are diamonds. The industry is not as saturated as oil or gas so the price is much more reflective of the material and labor costs of mining than supply and demand. Demand is still not incredible but industrial uses take a back seat to jewelry so it's pretty clear we have more gold than we *need* as a global society. If all countries were equal and consumed the same amount of gold for industry it might be different but the world is very uneven in that sense. ;1;0;False;RallyUp;dz5vc9x;Hodlers be like;8k4kdf;https://i.imgur.com/pUuGFhP.jpg

"Actually, if you bought $44 of the S&P500 in 1971 and reinvested the dividends, [you'd have $4,840 now](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator). It's robust to survivorship bias. Note that I'm using the S&P500 here because it's much closer to a cap weighting than the DJI.

Hell, if you invested $44 in US treasuries in 1975 [and reinvested the coupon](https://dqydj.com/treasury-return-calculator/) you'd have $791, and that's at a _much_ lower volatility than gold.

If you want to argue about survivorship bias in the returns in these examples, do it at the country level - in 1971, would I have known to invested in US equities rather than Mexican?

"In order to be a competing currency Bitcoin must satisfy three things:

* Store of value
* Means of exchange
* Unit of account 

Your points satisfy point 1 but if we cannot spend it (transaction volume leads to high fees on BTC) then we don't have a means of exchange. If you cannot purchase goods with BTC then BTC will never become a unit of account because we aren't pricing anything with BTC.
