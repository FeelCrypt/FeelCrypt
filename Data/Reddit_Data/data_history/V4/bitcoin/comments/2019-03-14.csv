"You can't eat silver.

I think you underestimate the drive people will have to restore and maintain the internet.

People won't revert to a steam punk 1800s lifestyle, they will rebuild things as quickly as possible, and decentralized networks like the internet and bitcoin are the easiest and will be some of the first things operational.

And even if only a few percentage of miners remain, they will keep mining as soon as their basic survival needs are met.";1;1;False;shanita10;eihbty1;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png
The vast majority of miners are located in China, reports of around 70 to 75 %. So while miners are distributed they are still concentrated in certain areas. They also require a level of manpower to maintain. If the shit hit the fan are those people who monitor, reboot, repalce cables etc going to hang around or are they going to find their families and do what they need to to survive? The miners that will continue are smaller hobby miners who have their mining operations close to home and even if we say that these type of miner control 25% of the mining network, and a further 25% of the large miners continue operating through automation, we have halved the processing power. But it's going to be 3 months at best before things settle enough that anyone is transacting in bitcoin, at which point more will have gone off line and no new hardware is coming online, not for a long time. So no, in the event of an apocalyptic event , bitcoin or crypto is not going to be the currency of first choice. I'm a big believe in bitcoin but bitcoin only works if the world is interconnected the way it is today, with almost unlimited power supply and communication networks.

Maybe you don't understand how bitcoin works, difficult adjustments and transaction times matter. You need an orderly exit of mining power so that you have a workable system. Lose too much too soon and the block times mean you cannot transact in a reasonable time frame, which makes it useless. At that stage you might as well start your own local blockchain.;1;1;False;011010110;eihcad7;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png
I know how it works. Your estimates are too pessimistic. You aren't going to easily destroy 99.99 % of active and inactive mining capacity in any realistic disaster scenario in which humans live.;1;0;False;shanita10;eiihgjf;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png
