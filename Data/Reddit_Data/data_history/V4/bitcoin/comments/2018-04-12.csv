"I started this comment as ""I don't entirely get how you don't lose money if you sell your BTC for a loss"" thinking the current price mattered and assuming it would screw up your hodl too because of rebuying at a different price.

As I typed my question, it became clear what the answer was and I've modified this comment to hopefully help others.

My big confusion is (was): If I bought at 8.5k and now I sell for stuff online at 6.5k I'm taking a loss. I didn't buy to take a loss, so I hodl. (This is how it felt and how I thought) 

But

If I use that 6.5k Bitcoin to buy something, say an expensive domain name. Then I go buy BTC at 6.5k, it is the same thing as if I spent 6.5k in cash.

At the end of the day I have my 6.5k domain name and I still have my 6.5k worth of Bitcoin and I spent 6.5k in cash (plus minor fees) just like I would've if I bought with cash instead of BTC.

So minor fees (idk how much, could someone give me an estimate for this example?) is basically the cost of us all getting our Lambos.

"I disagree.  USD still has a lot of benefits over bitcoin.  It is far more widely accepted, for one, and money (as a form of shared ledger) benefits from network effect; the more people that use a ledger, the easier it is to use that ledger as a common ledger.  

USD is also guaranteed by the most powerful government on earth and it's value has been relatively stable compared to just about any other commodity since 1913.  Yes, it depreciates in value, so you don't want to use it as a strong store of wealth, which is why you should buy more valuable goods (like stocks, bonds, real estate, 401k's, IRA's, precious metals or bitcoin for instance) with any excess money.

Thus simply said, I disagree. It's a very unpopular opinion, but I just don't see it as much of an issue. Of course BTC can't be stable, because it continues to pump up in value. 


And this will also never change, but it will exponentially keep pumping in more money. 



And also, I've yet to really find a coin, that's not like this. BCH for example pumps in value, as Bitcoin pumps along - if it doesn't die. Hell maybe it takes over, I don't know. 



Ether pumps too. And most other coins really. That would kind of mean that none of them are not usable as currency.

"> and that's because it teaches people to spend their money as quickly as possible and punishes saving

you don't need to spend (or invest) money ""as quickly as possible"" at 0-3% inflation. At that rate you have months before you would notice any meaningful decrease in purchasing power. If you need to store wealth over periods of years you're much better off storing it in a form that provides a benefit to your life (like a house, or solar panels, or a share of a wealth generating business). you can't live in a pile of cash or heat your home with it (well, not unless you set it on fire).

When people spend money it doesn't waste or destroy any wealth, they just convert wealth held in money into wealth in a usable form. If you spend money to buy solar panels that cuts your electricity bills in half, that is not somehow worse for the economy than if you just leave that cash under a mattress. 

Saving doesn't generate any wealth, investment does. you don't want to encourage saving (hoarding) of currency, you want to encourage investment. A currency system that rewards you more for doing nothing with cash than to put it to good use is not a good one.


>Money isn't meant to generate value itself, it's a way to keep track of things we own and exchange with each other

It's meant to generate value by facilitating value generating trade. Money that never changes hands never generates any wealth.

>I'm currently using bitcoin for saving and fiat for spending because that's the cheapest and easiest way for me

>Other deflationary assets are not as liquid and convenient for me, and also are not nearly as exciting.

If you're using fiat for trade and bitcoin for savings then why do you care if other deflationary assets are not as liquid? Savings you're holding for years at a time don't need to be liquid. And there is far more liquidity in things like gold and index trackers, and more stability.

At any given time 100% of the money is under someone's mattress.

I largely agree with you though, I think that is why fiat has beaten gold--2% loss per year is less than the pain-in-the-ass that gold + cost of securing it is.  Fiat beat gold in the market, and would do so again.  Also the supply of gold is increasing as well, especially when the price goes up and people start mining like crazy.  This is not the case with Bitcoin.

">I am not saving money in order to die with it, I might want to buy a house with it for example or start a business

you know instead of saving for 20-30 years to buy a house, getting no benefit from that money all that time, and having to pay rent all that time, you can just get a mortgage and then immediately own the house and then live in it for the rest of your life while you pay off the mortgage?

Then instead of paying rent you're just paying off ownership of the house.

Also in 20-30 years the house will likely be more valuable than when you bough it, so you will save money overall by getting a mortgage instead of saving for decades to buy it.

You don't get it do you? I don't like the current debt based system so I refuse to borrow money from a bank to buy a house where I'd be stuck in if the housing market would collapse. I stick by my own principals and am not going to the bank to beg for their stinking money. I don't need it anyways.

"> so I refuse to borrow money from a bank to buy a house where I'd be stuck in if the housing market would collapse.

If you save up for 30 years to buy a house and then the housing market collapses, you still lose just as much value. The difference is you'll have to be paying rent for 30 years, on top of the cost of buying the house. 

If you get a mortgage for $100,000, you might end up having to pay $140,000 back over 20-30 years, even if there is a house price crash and the house goes down to $60,000, you will still be better off compared to saving because you won't have had to spend $100,000 on rent during that time.

There's also benefits to home-owning beyond money, which is being able to do whatever the fuck you want with your home.

Loans exist specifically to take advantage of this kind of marginal utility. If it was better to save than to borrow then people wouldn't bother borrowing.

Do you think saving to buy a house in full is a better option and people are just too dumb to realize it? ""they can't because fiat is inflationary"" is not an answer, there are thousands of deflationary assets, and your only previous argument against them was liquidity, which isn't an issue for saving 30 years to buy a house. you buy gold for 30 years then sell it to buy a house.

>I am comfortable where I am now financially and the only thing that truly drives me is building a better future for humanity

Let's suppose that ONLY libertarians, cyberpunks, and criminals were to use bitcoin, and everyone else were to refuse and only use USD.

When niche currency like bitcoin was effectively banned in some countries like China only a handful of individuals continued to buy them and they had to pay a premium on top of regular price. I don't see how decreasing the availability and usefulness of bitcoin would entice everyone to actually use it instead of more convenient options. If anything, banning exchanges and stinging local bitcoins will decrease the demand because it's a pain in the ass and there is risk.

That's what you believe but the masses aren't convinced. And the demand is out there but nowhere near the entire world, more like some small parts of every society that include tech enthusiasts, libertarians, criminals, people who disagree with monetary policy and...well, a lot of fomoed speculators who wanted to get rich quick. It's a niche and everyone has different opinion about what it should be, what it is and how it should work. Medium of exchange? Electronic cash? Store of value? Investment? Digital gold?

Our governments used to back these paper monies with actual real gold, and then decided it would be better to just outlaw gold, confiscate it, then eventually let everyone have it back after the price had skyrocketed. Eventually, they got rid of that idea all together, and decided to remove the backing and replace it with.....get this.....**nothing**.

The false dichotomy here is ""hodl vs. spedn""... do you consider selling btc to someone spending it?

Miners spend REAL MONEY to mine, they need to recoup. They sell. It's that simple. And that and future speculation is what drives the price, buoyed by hypothetical maximum values. If you believe that bitcoin will become the one world currency, it's grossly undervalued, for example.


Besides, 99% of the ""spending"" of bitcoin goes into a payment processors' wallet. They're basically just buying bitcoin from you with a promise to transfer the fiat to someone else. 

They then have positions and sell off as needed + profitable.

">Do you think saving to buy a house in full is a better option and people are just too dumb to realize it? ""they can't because fiat is inflationary"" is not an answer, there are thousands of deflationary assets, and your only previous argument against them was liquidity, which isn't an issue for saving 30 years to buy a house. you buy gold for 30 years then sell it to buy a house.

Our current system doesn't really allow most people to save up enough money to buy a house without going into debt or waiting for 30 years. With a better form of money like Bitcoin it would take much less time though. Gold is better than fiat but still you don't really own it unless you have it physically which is a lot less convenient than owning Bitcoin instead. With Bitcoin you are in complete control of your own money which combined with it being a deflationary asset makes it perfect for me. It's also young and has much more potential for growth, albeit also more volatile due to this. I don't think it's for everyone right now, but as it grows and develops and becomes more stable it will become more attractive for more people I believe. I never recommend other people to put their entire savings in it, but a small percentage isn't a bad thing. I put in a lot more but that's because it's my passion and my work.

>Are you going to use your bitcoin then to invest in bitcoin based businesses/projects like Lightning? Or are you just going to sit on them and wait for other peoples work to make them more valuable?

Sure I invest into projects I find valuable like Lightning, is there any reason why you're assuming I just sit on my coins and do nothing with them? I certainly will not spend my coins to buy silly things with it, but sure I use some of it for investing purposes. I don't shame people who just hold onto their coins though, I think that's a perfectly legitimate use case. By holding onto your coins you are adding human value to the network and make it a little bit bigger. Just by doing that you already support the entire project and help it grow. Not everyone is a builder or good at investing (look at how many people invest in scammy ICOs), and that's perfectly fine.

Bitcoin is great for saving, right now however it's not very good for spending. As Lightning develops more and becomes more popular this will change in the future, but right now the blockchain simply doesn't scale well enough for it to become popular as a payment option.

If the store of value aspect gains traction more and more people will want it. And when many people have coins then more and more companies will take them. But imo Bitcoin's goal is not for us to buy stuff for which we can use Paypal/credit card but use it where either there is no alternative or the alternative is more expensive and slow. The West does not have a payment problem(besides drugs or payments to remote countries) but it has a store of value problem as equity/real estate is imo super inflated so I believe the medium of exchange use case will be 2-3rd world countries.

you haven't explained why this would be unless you think bitcoin is going to have a higher/more reliable rate of return than any other asset.

The S&P 500 has grown 9.8% a year over the last 90 years, which is about the highest rate of return any investment has had over such a long time period. If that wasn't high enough for people to just save for homes instead of borrowing for them, how high do you think bitcoins growth rate is going to be over that kind of time period? 15% a year? 20%? 

>By holding onto your coins you are adding human value to the network and make it a little bit bigger

How does the network know the difference between a coin that is being ""hodled"" and a coin that has just been lost and is never going to be spent? How does a coin doing nothing sitting on a paper wallet somewhere help the network anymore than coins doing nothing because their owners lost them and can't recover them?


> I never recommend other people to put their entire savings in it, but a small percentage isn't a bad thing.

This contradicts the idea that its not about speculation. ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" is how people talk about gambling, not saving. If you're interested in saving you put it in the absolute safest place you can. You must think other things are safer than bitcoin if you think people should only put a small % of their savings in it.

>Sure I invest into projects I find valuable like Lightning, is there any reason why you're assuming I just sit on my coins and do nothing with them?

You've talked about ""hodling"" and using bitcoin for savings, and you can't have money in savings and invested in businesses at the same time.  If you had all your bitcoin tied up in investments then you wouldn't have any bitcoins, you'd have a % of businesses you bought with bitcoin, and those businesses would then use those bitcoins to grow their business.

If your goal is to help bitcoin and not become rich then you would accomplish that better by investing that money in projects that are trying to make bitcoin more usable than just sitting on coins for years waiting for them to go up in value.

"I guess the question is why do you assume people arent proftting off day trading? If someone has been day trading for a living over a long time period, chances are they are beating the market or they wouldnt bother.

When you bring your car to the mechanic, do you assume hes losing money by fixing cars? Or do you assume the reason hes fixing cars for a living is because hes making money doing it?";1;1;False;BeardPatrol;dx7na0c;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto.

The thing is though your analogy fails because one you expect me to believe these people are out there, yet you don’t actually know of any.  Nobody takes anything to a day trader, they have no specialty except supposed apothecary.  Why do people play slots all the time or bet on horse races, or lottery do you think these are ways to make a living?  “Because people do it, it must be profitable” is some stretched logic;1;1;False;edgestander;dx7xzfl;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto.

"Well my parents grew up in a rich neighborhood, so they knew professional traders. My girlfriend's best friend's father also makes his living trading.

There are people on youtube like Ross from warrior trading that shows all his trades and he handedly beats the market. Hell the IRS has a special distinction and different rules for filing capital gains/losses specifically for professional traders.

Why do you assume these people dont exist? Simply because you dont know any? There are millions of different professions on the planet, for 99.9% of them I dont personally know anybody. Ive heard a tree surgeon is a thing, never met a tree surgeon, dont even know what they do. That doesnt mean there arent people making a living as tree surgeons though.

I mean just google professional day trader, im sure you can find a boatload of names.";1;0;False;BeardPatrol;dx87itq;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto. All your TA means nothing;8b0v18;https://i.redd.it/26bocgtchxq01.jpg
"HahahahHAHAHAH you fucking retard. While it is true this is the internet where you can (and obviously just did) create a beautiful lie, unfortunately you’ve been busted.

In this comment you made 23 days ago you mentioned your work. Congrats for being stupid.

Upon further reading it seems you are possibly a graphic designer with hopes to become a millionaire off of genesis. Unfortunately for you genesis had dropped more than half of its price since you bought in it looks like. LOL. 
You don’t even have a million dollars, pathetic.

Here ladies and gents we see a retard in his natural habitat. Observe how easily his stupidity is detected. 

And I’m still up about 980% just holding so I will keep it up thanks. 

Fucking REKT.

Yes they are. But I really don’t want any people running around arguing that „technical analysis is always bad“... Also, i mainly wanted to point that out, because I’m pretty sure nobody „running a Quant firm“ would have this kind of an opinion and/or express themselves in the same way.
