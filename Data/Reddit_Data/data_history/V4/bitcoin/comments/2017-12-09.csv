"The thing is, you invest in something like a stock because it has inherent value. When you buy stock in a company, you're investing in something that produces a good or service. You give money to a company under the assumption that the money is invested in product production which will generate some return on investment. A stock price goes up when the company does well and goes down when a company does poorly. When boeing sells more airplanes than they thought they would in a quarter, their company is more valuable so the value of a stock goes up. 

With bitcoin, the price is going up simply because the price is going up. Everyone I know who has bought bitcoin is going with the logic of ""Wow, it was like 9k a few weeks ago and now its 16k. I could make so much money on this."" There's no actual value in it. The intrinsic value of a bitcoin (it's use as a currency) is basically in the toilet because no one wants to use something so unstable for normal transactions. The price seems to completely unresponsive to anything that *should* be detracting from it's value of a currency. It's like the textbook definition of a bubble. Eventually, everyone that wants to buy in buys in and the price stabilizes. Once the price stops increasing, everyone looking for a quick buck with no actual interest in using bitcoin as a currency sells it. The value drops which makes more people want to get rid of it in a nasty feedback loop that makes it worthless almost overnight. So yes, treat it as what it actually is: a gambling game on when the bubble bursts.

Oh, it's a currency. Just a crappy one for right now. But stability is the least important tenant in my opinion. Most important?

1. Transaction fees. It can't cost me $4 to pay for coffee. And no merchant can afford to pay the fees for their customers at that cost.

2. Acceptance. Yeah, losing Steam is bad news, but it demonstrates the real problem (the fees). If the fees are low (or a *percentage* of the transaction amount), pricing can be done automatically, so fluctuation in value really isn't a big deal.

Lol sorry bud but you should take a look at Australia's gdp charts, it aint pretty. As for Trump being ineffective? He's been in office for less than a year and has done a ton of damage to democrat causes. And I am a registered democrat -- I plan on voting for Bernie or Warren. But I'm also objective and can not STAND the European moral elitism that I as an American, studying in Europe, have to suffer through. Objectively speaking, Trump is a brash, awful man, but he's trying to do everything that he campaigned for, and as someone who's disillusioned by candidates who tend to do the exact opposite, I commend Trump.

"I also do the encrypt your private key with a password thing, and genuinely curious on why you think the computer must never connect to the internet... this is what I do to my computer before and after typing my password:

1. Disconnect the internet cable and all non-volatile memory (hard disks, SSDs, etc).
2. Load Ubuntu into the RAM and plug in a pendrive with some tools to encrypt the private key and optionally with an unsigned transaction to sign it. Copy those files and *unplug the pendrive*.
3. Generate your private key through the ""sha256sum"" linux command and some dices. Copy it to an encryption tool and ""type"" in the password using the mouse (copy paste the characters using the mouse, in case your keyboard has a hardware keylogger or whatever) to encrypt it. Open a different, totally independent encryption tool and decrypt it to see that the first tool did everything right.
4. Get a QR Code of your encrypted private key and your public address and scan it with your phone to get (make sure your unencrypted private key is not showing on the screen).
5. Turn down and unplug your computer from the electricity. This erases all RAM memory and other volatile memory.
6. Pass the scanned QR Code into a pendrive and kinda repeat the process to decrypt the privatekey through the offline computer to see that everything works well. Then plug the computer off from electricity again.

That's it, then I plug all the non-volatile memory back in, internet cable and electricity and keep using my computer as I normally do.";3;2;False;wjohngalt;dqzdv7j;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

Not trying to argue here, but I think you might be a little confused on your federal tax law.  A capital loss can't be carried back to previous tax years.  If you failed to report a loss on a previous tax return, then you can file an amended return for that year, and possibly get a refund as long as the three year filing period hasn't expired.  A capital loss can offset capital gains in the year the loss is incurred, and if there is still a loss leftover, you can deduct $3,000 in the year incurred.  Then if there is still any loss leftover, it can be carried forward indefinitely until it is used up by either deducting $3k per year, offsetting future capital gains, and/or until you die.;2;1;False;kmoc_;dqzwt7e;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

You say you're not mad, but sorry to break it to you, you're coming off as VERY bitter. The USA has suffered through bad leadership (Bush), but we still managed to thrive. However, Trump has proven himself to be an effective leader in accomplishing many of the things he promised during the campaign trail. Most importantly, the economy continues to flourish with low unemployment, high GDP growth, and a record breaking stock market. But yeah keep arguing that America is slipping. Maybe instead of worrying so much about us, you can channel that energy to your own country -- Australia isn't doing so hot, hasn't your GDP collapsed the past few years? ;0;1;False;;dqzqwvc;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

I'll just put in my two bitcoins. Congress believes that the only real use for it as a currency is for illicit financial activity, like buying drugs, money laundering, and funding terror for example. As a digital precious metal, it's not really useful except as a speculative instrument that has no floor, where value investors see it as a bargain. Value investors see no value in it, not because they don't understand the technology, but because there's nothing inherently tying the useful technology to bitcoin. That's why they say it's a bubble by definition. So, these Congress-folks have been briefed on bitcoin by mainly expert investors, who have explained to them that the only true value of bitcoin as a currency (as opposed to being a speculative bubble where there's always a dumber buyer) is for illegal activity. That's something legislators can't ignore, but it's also very tricky to get the wording right. These things will go through several phases of amendments and be interpreted in every way possible before it ever comes to the floor for a vote. ;0;0;False;fangio2verstappen;dqzcxni;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

"i mean what benefit is making it the new gold, and not your second option?

right now it can be less secure (at least storing it for the masses), slower, more expensive, more volatile. Yes all those might change and improve as it gets more legitimacy and developed, but what would have been the point?

While i do think people like that it is not controlled by the government, and it brings more competition to currency, I think the bigger appeal was the privacy and the deregulatory aspect to it. It enabled a lot of freedom in expression via how we spend our money.

I think just regulating it to just be a new formal currency will disappoint a lot of the people who bought into what bitcoin was about";1;0;False;ram0h;dqzab4e;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

"Also, you have two positions:

1. Not reporting trollish game money. Pay ""x"" amount of taxes.

2. Report non-zero amount of trollish game money. Pay ""x"" plus some additional non-zero amount ""y"". 

For case 2 you'll cause one of several things:

1. They audit you, and decide you need to pay more taxes.

2. They audit you, and decide you get some of ""y"" refunded.

3. No audit.

In cases 1 or 2, your tax dollars pay the IRS to audit you. In cases 1 and 3 you're paying taxes you really don't need to pay. I'm all for malicious compliance, but the IRS is the last agency you want to troll. No matter what you do, they win. It's your money that ends up paying them to unravel your evil plot.

"I have no problems with governments regulating cryptocurrencies.  In fact, I think it would make the community stronger by making trading, storage and manipulation of cryptocurrencies safer.  However, I don't have enough faith in the US government to get it right.  I think exchanges should follow the lead of what exchanges have done in Japan where they have banded together with law enforcement to help rid the community of cybercrime.  Show government officials that they want to help.  Regulation is inevitable.  Don't let the government dictate how regulation should work.

"The hardware wallet generates the seed and thus private keys, 100% offline.  It stores the keys in a way where they will never touch the Internet ever.  The seed will never be guessed, as it's something like 2000^24 or something insane like that.  I don't know how it works, but private keys are never exposed to the Internet, even when they're used.  Cryptographic magic.  Of course, you are trusting Trezor or Ledger that their chips act and function as they say they do.


Internet and desktop wallets can use the same wallet generating, deterministic algorithm as the hardware wallets, which is why the seed can reproduce the same private keys with the same seed.  This is great as a backup, but of course, the act of entering the seed online or in a desktop wallet on a compromised computer is where the danger comes into play.";1;1;False;;dqzir4b;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

">The capacity to mass-produce books was incredibly subversive to medieval institutions, just as microtechnology will prove subversive to the modern nation-state. Printing rapidly undermined the Church's monopoly on the word of God, even as it created a new market for heresy. Ideas inimical to the closed feudal society spread rapidly, as 10 million books were published by the final decade of the fifteenth century. Because the Church attempted to suppress the printing press, most of the new volumes were published in those areas of Europe where the writ of established authority was the weakest. This may prove to be a close analogy with attempts by the U.S. government today to suppress encryption technology. The Church found that censorship did not suppress the spread of subversive technology; it merely assured that it was put to its mostsubversive use.";1;0;False;Enchilada_McMustang;dqzm6un;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

4) The cryptos have developed into another asset class imho , therefore, a 1-1.5% of one's wealth is a sensible thought.
5) Diversify.  Don't buy only the BTC
6) Even if BTC goes to 1 million, it would be far fetched to think that the main fiat currencies will be worthless.
7) Conclusion: 1-1.5% in cryptos (money you can afford to loose without consequences), diversify, long-term buy and hold strategy, absolutely no retirement funds

"I wouldn't bet on that happening in my lifetime.  Probably not my kids either.

Most bitcoin keys are known only by hash, and hashing is very resistant to quantum attacks.  Basically, there are general purpose quantum algorithms that solve _any_ computation problem in, roughly, the square root of the time needed to solve it otherwise.  Those can be used to answer the question ""What is at least one of the private keys that corresponds to a public key that solves this known hash?""

The tricky part is that these algorithms work on circuits.  What is a circuit, in this context?  It is a device with no concept of time.  There are no loops, no memory, no control structures.  You set the inputs and the outputs converge on the answer.

This is most emphatically __not__ how we build hashing devices.  All of our hash functions have loops, which need to be unrolled to build a circuit.  And by ""unrolled"", I mean physically.  Doing 80 passes?  You need 80 physical stages.  Combining or mixing the bits along the way?  You need more gates to tie it together.  Using a lookup table or an initialization vector?  God help you...

We do not possess the technology to build a hashing circuit today using conventional electronics.  Even if we were willing to throw our biggest HPC clusters at the problem, I'm not even sure if our current computers are powerful enough to even design a hypothetical one.  A handfull of unrolls and you've got more gates than we've ever put on a chip, and RIPEMD160 has 80 iterations.

Oh, and did I mention that it needs to be a _quantum_ circuit?  I think the world record for quantum gates in a coherent device can still be counted with one of your shoes on.";3;0;False;kjj9;dqzmkko;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"This is so incredibly wrong, I had to comment to hope people don't take your advice.  Bitcoin is safe and secure when it's not sitting on an exchange.  It is at risk on an exchange.  Plain and simple.

Say a coinbase user doesn't have MFA (multi-factor authentication) on their account and they reused their password when they initially set up their account.  All of the funds from that single account can be transferred and *poof* they're gone.  This is not even an example of a ""large scale breach"" but rather a personal targeted attack.  

A large scale breach would be coinbase's username/password directory to be exfiltrated, and then once again, anyone without MFA on their account will have their funds drained.

Cold offline storage prevents any sort of credential breach.  

Please stop giving awful advice to the community.";7;3;False;fightinirishpj;dr03t2d;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

">I see many people are upset about Coinbase and their insane transfer fees so I thought I would make a simple instruction about how to transfer Bitcoin outta Coinbase for free. Lets get to it!

 >1. Go to GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase account. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and it’s their platform for more technical people. 

 >2. After you logged in, verify your account if necessary. 

 >3. Press the “deposit” button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It’s free and takes only seconds. 

> 4. Press the “withdraw” button, then open the “BTC address” tab and put the address you wish to send your bitcoins to in there. 

>That’s it! You have sent your bitcoins to another address and avoided some serious fees.

Lately CB has had issues, I think due to the insane volume.  Manual verification is safer for holders but it causes tons of delays.  Too bad.  But I prefer delays to losing EVERYTHING through theft and fraud.

They've been great for me, and when they made a mistake (one of my withdrawals didn't happen) they gave me $5 in bc by way of apology.

"If you're looking to hold BTC off exchange, which is wise, then you'll need an off-exchange wallet. Options potentially good for someone starting out (in order of increasing complexity) include:

* Phone wallet - Easy to start. Be sure to physically write down and securely store your back up seed. See video linked below for suggestions.
* Computer wallet - Harder to set up. Be sure to securely store your backup seed. E.g. Electrum, etc. See video linked below for notes of caution.
* Hardware wallet - Very secure. 
* Paper wallet - Good for hodling, hard to set up securely, need to be careful when spending. E.g. https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/

Coinbase doesn't support or is slow to support hard forks like Bcash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond, so holding them in an external wallet allows you to claim coins from those forks and sell them. Selling Bcash and Bitcoin Gold would have enabled one to get as much as 0.3 BTC for each bitcoin owned.;9;2;False;asmileforyou;dr077jw;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

Well the general advice is not to store your Bitcoin on the exchange because should the exchange ever get hacked you lose your money. A wallet only you control is much safer. Now if we’re talking $100 or something, it’s probably not worth taking off CB because the transfer fees will eat up your Bitcoin. I use $100 as a small amount but it’s really whatever you feel safe with. Should you transfer it to a wallet and want to sell in a month from now, you just send your Bitcoin back to Coinbase and then sell at that point, however two things to note. First you’ll pay Bitcoin transfer fees for going CB-Wallet and then Wallet-CB. Secondly you can’t sell on CB if you want CAD funds, you’ll have to use a Canadian exchange. CB hasn’t support CAD for a while now. Let me know if that makes sense, I’m on mobile so typed it up quickly. ;1;1;False;vanta_blk;dr0c4r2;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

Just compare the fees between CB and Quad because that’s basically the only difference. Both are exchanges so not a good place for long term BTC storage.

":D

If you haven't found the info already, it's basically placing an order for a set price sometime in the future.

Say BTC goes for $15000 right now and you want to buy 1 BTC.  You could place a limit order for $14900 with 1 BTC through GDAX and then if the price falls down to that level ($14900) your order will ""fill"" and you get the 1 BTC for that price.

The same works for selling, but in the opposite direction (limit price must be higher than current price).  If you do it this way, you are a ""Maker"" as you ""make"" the price you want to buy/sell at and you therefore pay 0% fees.

"In addition to that, as Andreas said in the video I linked above, ""not your keys*, not your coin."" I'm not saying that Coinbase is ill-intentioned or will get hacked. Yet there have been corrupt and hacked exchanges in the past (e.g. Mt.GOX, etc.), and we cannot predict whether it would happen again. 

I can understand that newcomers may consider this unnecessarily fearful. You may have not been around when Mt.GOX went down and this sub had pinned posts reminding people to seek emotional help rather than taking their lives over the losses they had.

"keeping funds on an exchange is always a risk.  Coinbase seems to be pretty reputable, however everyone thinks their exchange is reputable until it is breached.

"The default mode is a marketplace transaction, which means you set your dollar amount you want to buy, or bitcoin amount you want to sell, and when you hit the button, the transaction goes through immediately at whatever the market price happens to be at that instant.  This is referred to in GDAX parlance as a 'taker' order, and a fee is applied to the transaction.

If you place a limit order, however, you enter in both an amount of bitcoin *and* a price you want to buy/sell it at.  When you hit the buy button, instead of going through immediately, your order goes into a queue of sorts, and the order is not filled until the market price reaches your stated target price **and** a seller's order at the same price can be matched to yours.  There are a few details I'm leaving out but that's the gist of it.  Limit orders are fulfilled at a later time as long as certain conditions are met.  You set it and forget it.  This is classified as a 'maker' order, and there is no fee.

It's just like any other bitcoin transaction, where there's a tradeoff between immediate fulfillment at higher rates or delayed fulfillment at lower rates.

EDIT: there is a downside to limit orders: you might miss your attempted transaction.  Whereas marketplace orders will always be fulfilled since you're effectively agreeing to make the trade at the current price, if you set your limit poorly the price might trend in the opposite direction you expect it to and your order will not get filled.  Also, the coins or dollars you're putting up for the order get sequestered from the rest of your wallet, so you can't set two price points with the same coins.  If you want to lay a spread, you need to split the coin you have to work with into smaller orders.";10;1;False;ritmusic2k;dr0ae24;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

"This coinbase to gdax transfer process seems to be posted everywhere but it never hurts to see it again and help others.  I'm in learning mode myself and laughing that I didn't buy anything years ago when I was first curious about it.  Probably thousands of people in the same boat.  Anyway as I'm learning it does feel like the fees are one of the largest risk factors to me which will hinder broad adoption.  I see I can transfer from coinbase to gdax and then say out to a hardware wallet for free.  When I was looking last night at trying to learn what a transfer would look like sending from my hardware wallet out to an address the lowest fee was about $10!  Didn't matter the value transferred, that was the fee if I was pretending to send $3 or $1000 worth.  $10 was the lowest fee.  I have heard about the transaction backlog impacting the fees but personally I can't fathom even paying $1 when I need to move funds from account to account or person to person.  All of my regular everyday banking accounts or retirement accounts are free.  Once every ten years maybe I'll need a wire transfer for a $20 fee when buying property but that's rare.  Hopefully the fees will get down.  I can't see success unless fees are extremely low.  

Just my thoughts and yes I've read about alternate currencies with lower fees.  It's exciting to learn about.";1;0;False;jbuzolich;dr092gi;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

"Hi Someone please help me with my energy calculation. I wanna buy the S9 Antminer. It says it consumes 0.098 W/Gh and the capacity is 13.5 Th/s. I thought then the consumption is 98 W/Th and therefore 1323W/13.5TH. Watt is J/s and therefore it should consume 1323 W/s. So 1.323 kW/s, which would mean 114307KW/day. Assuming price of eletricity= 0.05cent/khw i would pay 5715 euros/day???? I know i miscalculated something, but i don't know what. If someone could please clear thing up. Thanks

FROM Coinbase:


We at Coinbase couldn’t be more excited by the explosion of interest in digital currencies. The last few weeks has seen an unprecedented increase in the price of digital currencies. More people are engaging with our platform than ever and that bodes well for the future of the digital currency. At the same time, it does create extreme volatility and stress on our systems. We take this very seriously and wanted to share some important thoughts.

We’re continuing to invest heavily to scale our platform

Over the course of this year we have invested significant resources to increase trading capacity on our platform and maintain availability of our service. We have increased the size of our support team by 640% and launched phone support in September. We have also invested heavily in our infrastructure and have increased the number of transactions we are processing during peak hours by over 40x.

There may be downtime which can impact your ability to trade

Despite the sizable and ongoing increases in our technical infrastructure and engineering staff, we wanted to remind customers that access to Coinbase services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume. This could result in the inability to buy or sell for periods of time. Despite ongoing increases in our support capacity, our customer support response times may be delayed, especially for requests that do not involve immediate risks to customer account security. You can read more in our Coinbase User Agreement.

Be an educated investor

We also wanted to remind customers of some of the risks associated with trading digital currency. Digital currencies are volatile and the prices can go up and down. Due to the rapidly changing price of digital currencies, some customers may not have sell limits that are sufficient relative to the value of total digital currency they are storing on Coinbase. Sell limits are one of the many measures Coinbase takes to protect client accounts and assets.

As a proactive measure, we encourage customers to check the following items on their accounts:


Ensure your email address is properly receiving all communications and notifications from Coinbase. To learn more about ensuring email delivery, please refer to this support article.

Ensure your two-factor authentication is updated and functional. If you have recently switched mobile devices, your two-factor authentication needs to be properly migrated to the new device. In addition, please migrate from SMS two factor to Google Authenticator to enhance the security on your account, if you have not already done so. To learn more about two-factor authentication, please refer to this FAQ.

Familiarize yourself with your buy and sell limits. They can be found here.

Complete any pending identity verifications. During times of significant volatility, ID verification may become degraded or unavailable. To learn more about identity verification on Coinbase, please refer to this FAQ.

Expect payments to take the maximum number of days indicated when making a deposit or withdrawal.
Stay up to date

We will continue to update customers for our website, our status page, in our apps, via email, on our blog and on Twitter.

We will keep you informed

We are committed to safety, security and transparency. We are working tirelessly to provide the best service and support but we can’t promise perfection during the periods of extraordinary demand. We will continue to do our best to keep our customers informed.

Thank you,

">Funny you like to sound smart but haven't figured out yet value is a subjective property

This comment chain is about whether bitcoin is in a speculative bubble or not. Things can be subjectively valued because they're in a speculative bubble so ""value is subjective"" is completely irrelevant to the point. The whole discussion is about *why* its valued, not whether it is or not.

""value is subjective"" is a truism. The entire field of economics is dedicated to studying what people subjectively value. There's a difference between something that is subjectively valued for many different economic uses and natural scarcity and something that is valued primarily because its artificially scarce and rapidly rising in price.

It's ironic that you complain about standard lines, because ""value is subjective"" and ""nothing has intrinsic value"" are both very common lines to try and dismiss any discussion of what makes bitcoin valuable/whether its in a speculative bubble.

You should be either welcoming the chance to correct what you believe are faulty ideas about bitcoin, or ignoring me if you don't believe its possible to correct me. Just dismissing me and saying I don't know what I'm talking about isn't persuasive, its a waste of time, because I've heard a much better quality of argument on these points before.

>Utility doesn't always correlate to value either

>Then you go on to say bitcoin has no utility 

Which is why I said its value came from speculation, not utility. you just said it didn't need to have utility to be valuable so you should have no problem with me saying bitcoins value is coming from speculation not utility.

>Feel free to leave this community you loathe and never come back.

">  It's really not that bad, and can be paid back in a couple of years if the US wanted to. 

How's that? The US has $20 trillion in debt. The US receives around $3.3 trillion in revenue each year. So even if the US cut 100% of spending, including mandatory spending, and put all revenue into paying off the debt, it would take at least 20/3.3 = 6 years. The US almost never cuts spending, so that's not going to happen. The best to hope for would be to a budget that's balanced so that's there's a slight surplus that would pay off the debt over the course of a couple decades...but greedy citizens who want ""free"" government services and corrupt politicians who don't have to care about the future ensure that's unlikely to happen.

"You're putting money into a stock with the hope that it makes you a *profit*. How much profit a person wants/expects is different, and whether or not they even have an exit price varies, but the goal of buying a stock is to resell it (unless you're buying it for dividends). This is the same thing as being a reseller of any physical item, it's just that physical items generally have a different market structure so they tend to have a set price instead of a variable one. If you actually research a stock and take it seriously then you bug it because you have a reasonable expectation based off of your analysis of all current information that its price will appreciate in the future.

How does a stock gain or lose value?  It's all about buyer perception and demand.  That's why you see scenarios where a company beat it's expected earnings and the value of the stock still drops when earnings are called.  So now you not only have to do your DD on the financial side of the company, but you also have to predict how the market will react to the information.

Sorry for your loss.  About 6 years ago I started investing in Cannabiscoin and accumulated about 500,000 coins.  I was pretty paranoid about someone getting ahold of my coins so I had my wallets offline on a aes 256 encrypted flash drive with a super crazy password.  The only way to remember the password unfortunately was to write it down so i could reference it when i needed it, and being paranoid I didnt want it stored on a file on my pc so I had it written down on a piece of paper on my bulletin board.  A couple months later I ran into some trouble and ended in the clinker for a couple of years so my parents cleaned out my house and moved all my stuff out.  Unfortunately the password I had written down and posted on the bulliten board was mistaken for trash and thrown away.  As im typing this the value is about $35,000.  I can literally open my wallet and look at the coins, but can never send them anywhere as I forever lost my password.  I kick myself in the ass all the time for being so careless, I can honestly relate to your brothers feelings although im sure its not quite the same magnitude.

"The point remains exiting too early is not some magical move where it's ""always a good thing"", unless that's the literal last investment you make in your life - or in the case of you having so much gains to cover the initial buy, unless that's your only investment, similar in concept with casino. Not saying investing is gambling, but in the sense that over the long term everyone will have gains and loses, and if you don't maximize your gains or simply consistently miss higher return potentials, then you will have a much much harder time to cover for loses, especially when the whole market or w.e it is you are investing in goes to shit for a longer than usual amount of time for which you may not remain solvent to hold through, or worse yet completely losing it.

Some people take ""not being greedy"" and pulling out early as a virtual, but unless you are doing index funds with dollar cost averaging, you are taking higher risks for higher returns; if you don't get the ""higher"" return enough, your high risks will likely catch up to you one day. 

Of course, this all depends on how much total risk across investments (or even life) and how much gains we are talking about, context is important.

"Keynesian economics, eh?  You're correct that deflationary currency reduces spending, but only so far.  People don't decide to skip meals because their money may be worth more in the future (their pay will be worth more in the future as well, after all).

Yes, having a low inflation rate has **definitely** boosted our economy over the last century - however at what cost?  The growing wealth inequality in our nation is directly tied to this.  The poor and middle classes spend most of their income and barely invest in something that gives more than 2-3% return (beating inflation) so they always ""lose"" and spend to fuel the growing wealth of the rich.

Inflation is a tax on the poor and eliminates savings if not invested (which causes bubbles!).  Check out Austrian economics, its cool.

"You don't understand.

The way bitcoin works, miners and nodes are largely redundant and only serve to make the system more secure and antifragile.

Transaction throughput is NOT determined by nodes and miners. It is determined by the block size limit and type of transactions that are occurring on the network. Adding more nodes and miners will not help in the slightest.

Supply = 1 MB every 10 minutes

Demand = total size of all transactions in the mempool (exclude SegWit witness data)

If you add a lot of miners *suddenly*, throughput temporarily increases until difficulty adjusts.

"That's a great question. How the hell do you tax this? 

Edit: If bitcoins are held for a period of less than a year before selling or exchanging, a short-term capital gains tax is applied, which is equal to the ordinary income tax rate for the individual. However, if the bitcoins were held for more than a year, long-term capital gains tax rates are applied. In the US, long-term capital gains tax rates are 0% for people in 10%-15% ordinary income tax rate bracket, 15% for people in the 25%-35% tax bracket, and 20% for those in the 39.6% tax bracket. Thus, individuals pay taxes at a rate lower than the ordinary income tax rate if they have held the bitcoins for more than a year. However, this also limits the tax deductions on long-term capital losses one can claim. Capital losses are limited to total capital gains made in the year plus up to $3000 of ordinary income.

"But you don't need to save money over long periods of time because if you want something thats going to be valuable for a long time you can just buy it with money.

Money only needs to facilitate trade, it doesn't need to be an investment.

Money can buy investments but investments can't be used as money. Gold holds its value much better than dollars but try to get anyone to accept a gold coin as payment. The value fluctuates too wildly, no one wants to have to check every time they spend a coin to see how much its worth, and it goes up in value over time so people would rather save it and spend currency that they know won't be worth more in future.

2% inflation is much more tolerable in a currency than 1000% deflation with wild swings where occasionally it drops double digit percentage of its value.

Money that people want to save and not spend ceases to be a currency. Which is okay for things like gold because it has other uses and other values. The whole point of bitcoin is that its meant to be valuable because you can use it to buy stuff. If it ceases to be useful to buy stuff with then where's the value coming from? Artificial scarcity is not enough to be valuable. you could copy the bitcoin protocol exactly and just make it have 1 coin ever, but it wouldn't make you a billionaire because no one would believe it was valuable just because it was rare.";1;0;False;suninabox;dr00n3a;New to Bitcoin?

Economies are built on savings and investment not spending, debt and credit.  That latter is what destroys healthy economies and puts us in the situation we are today.  Keynesian economists would have you believe that inflation is required for the exact reasons you stated above but it's a fallacy.  To argue that no one would ever spend a deflationary currency is to argue that human beings don't have to eat, or drink water or have clothes and shelter.  We would spend but we would spend at a responsible rate that more accurately represents our current need vs our long term goals.  In a credit ridden inflationary environment as we have today no one considers savings and investment a prudent idea, after all why would they?  Why would they save for the new house / the new car that they want when they can just go into massive debt and get it right now.  Human beings will always prefer to have now what they could save for and have later.  And governments will always prefer a printable currency that they can inflate into oblivion to pay for their massively indebted wars and social programs.  Eventually this comes to a head, and i believe this is what your seeing right now.  The people of the world want out of the currency wars, they want out of the printing bonanza and they want out of seeing the value of their currencies plummet year after year Bitcoin can do that for them, and so long as it continues to do that they will continue to divest from the classical Keynesian global economic system.;5;2;False;PercentEvil;dqzzmkr;New to Bitcoin?

"> “There is no utility to bitcoin outside of usage”

I meant trading, as I've been saying in previous messages. Typo corrected.

Bitcoin's value is entirely in trading, with no utility or value OUTSIDE of that. That obviously doesn't mean bitcoin has no utility - again, I said outside of trading. 

As already mentioned, the features of a cheque don't determine it's value. Just like the features of cash don't determine its value. Just like the features of blockchain don't determine the price of bitcoin on any given day. These factors are no the same thing as intrinsic value.


>*YES, BITCOIN HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE. NEITHER DOES A $1 BILL*
>https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-has-no-intrinsic-value-neither-does-a-dollar1-bill/

So unlike gold, pork bellies, stocks, and other assets the value of bitcoin does not come from intrinsic value because *bitcoin has no intrinsic value - just like fiat cash has no intrinsic value* (again, despite any regulations, supply limits, or security features etc. fiat currency still has no intrinsic value.)

Unlike fiat currency and bitcoin, many assets do have intrinsic value which helps to determine  price and which helps with stability as well.

Even software often has both utility and value if the company behind it shuts down entirely. Just like IP. Not sure what you meant by that example or what you meant by suggesting that I'm using old world thinking lol. 

I don't think bitcoin should be accessible for free, nor do think 'blockchain is cool and that bitcoin sucks' - not sure where you're getting many of these ideas about me. 

I'm just describing the reality of it's price determination and that it is actually not like gold, stocks, commodities etc (where this conversation started.)

"Like I said, if your answer is that you don't have to keep money in an exchange, well you don't have to keep it in a bank either. Banks are far more secure than exchanges, and exchanges are the only easy way of buying and selling bitcoin at the moment. ""bitcoins are more secure than banks"" isn't an equivalent argument. You don't need a bank to use cash. You *do* need an exchange if you want to easily buy and sell bitcoin.

If you keep your bitcoin buried in your backyard then its not any safer than just keeping gold buried in your backyard. Except you can't forget the password to gold and make it unusable. If you keep your bitcoin on an internet connected computer then it can be hacked.

 There's no way of getting stolen bitcoin back, unlike with central banking where its fairly easy to get your money back if someone steals your card details.

Regular banking is already more than secure so its not really an ""advantage"" that matters. What about the other points I brought up?

"The bitcoin blockchain has utility.  One can not utilize the blockchain without bitcoin.  Bitcoins are finite.  Their value is determined by the basic market forces of supply and demand.  

The *market value* of bitcoin is based on what people’s opinion of its value is at any given time (which, incidentally, is true for any asset), and may have speculation baked in.  The *intrinsic value* of bitcoin is in the size and security of the network and the utility of the blockchain.  You seem to think it should be accessible for free.

"James Altucher has some good points:

Here are his 10 predictions for cryptocurrencies:

At least one country's currency is likely to fail soon — likely Argentina or Venezuela. This will lead to mass adoption of bitcoin among that populace. That will in turn lead to bitcoin rising by more than $50,000 when it happens.

Mainstream banks will accept bitcoin, and will start offering storage and software access. They will also create cryptocurrency derivatives — as the CME is about to start doing.

Despite the optimism, there will be a massive wipeout, and 95 percent of the alt-coins out there will go away — just like the dot-com bust. The surviving coins will go up a ton. This will happen within next four-six months.

The U.S. government will secretly start accumulating one of the smaller cryptocurrencies to make it easier for gray-area transactions with other countries. This has already started happening but will really start to ramp up in 2018.

China will invest heavily in another cryptocurrency, but probably not bitcoin. China will want to have a cryptocurrency that is competitive with bitcoin, but under its centralized control. This will, in general, provide legitimacy to all cryptocurrencies.

One big problem with cryptocurrencies now is their volatility. At least one — basecoin — will likely dramatically reduce that in 2018.

More companies will pay freelancers with crypto, which will lead to calls for tax reform. There will need to be greater regressive sales taxes, which will ultimately require government cuts and eventually less power for national governments. This is a long-term prediction.

In the same way the internet changed the monopolistic phone industry, crypto will change the monopolization of government-backed money.

A new government organization will be created to analyze regulation on cryptocurrencies. This will, ironically, lead to a huge upswing in bitcoin and coins that provide actual utility.

Thousands of crypto companies will be created and go public, but only a few will be massive successes.";4;1;False;bluemoldy;dqzyw1t;New to Bitcoin? Here's how to spot a correction..;7ilgc9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ilgc9/new_to_bitcoin_heres_how_to_spot_a_correction/

"Fees are taken by trading platforms and until everyone gets to Bitcoin those fees will not go away anytime soon. Fees are also taken by Bitcoin debit cards because nobody works for free and they have to convert to fiat IRL.

But even if we get rid of fiat I doubt fees will ever go away. Banks are paid for a service and for security. Only very few merchants will be able to ensure smooth, reliable and fully secure transactions and store of currency. Furthermore it shouldn't be their business in the first place. And the ultimate issue will be security of storage. The USD is secured under the FDIC system which is funded by banks to the Fed and that they can pay through collection of interests and fees. An individual with a digital wallet will have to pay to ensure a hacker doesn't take off with his coins. Or he could store them offline. Basically bank accounts (fee) or Benjamins (free). Nothing new under the sun there. 

This is an amazing technology but once it is confronted to real life problems it will have to go through the same hurdles as fiat. 

One last thing: the biggest benefit of Bitcoin is anonymity, which is perfect for buying illegal stuff, avoiding taxes or laundering money. Once exchanges and debit card companies are mandated by governments to disclose transactions over a certain amount, this competing advantage will disappear in the developed world. But good luck convincing the arms trader in Libya or the black market small guy in Venezuela to give up his Benjamins.";1;0;False;;dr0c72y;New to Bitcoin?

"Okay, what's the value of a bitcoin to you if you could not trade it (if the price was zero)?

That's what it means when people say bitcoin does not have utility outside of trading bitcoin. 

I honestly don't think you're following the words I'm using. This part isn't really a debate. 

> It’s value as a currency or a tradeable asset is merely a byproduct of the technology as a whole.

Features (security, technology) of a currency like bitcoin don't determine its price on any given day, as mentioned.

"That's not what I meant - sorry for the confusion!

I said the utility is in trading (sending or receiving bitcoin). There is no utility outside of that - meaning it can't be used for anything other than currency. In that, it is very much like a fiat currency and has no actual intrinsic value.

Yes bitcoins features may make it more appealing than some other currency, but that doesn't change the reality of it being a currency (that isn't backed by anything).

"You'll notice when it's stable, when it doesn't fluctuate wildly or quickly changes value. You're right about mass adoption, I don't think it will calm down before it's distributed enough to the point where most people have some. This could take a very long time, I'm thinking years.

For now bitcoin is stuck being what it is, an asset with low utility. It can't really grow in its current condition and I'd argue it has grown too much for it is capable of now. Good thing is that it can be upgraded. The lightning network looks promising and is necessary for bitcoin to continue adoption. Next step (it will and already is overlapping) is for businesses to take bitcoin as payment. All of this will take time.

There are no transaction fees when you're a trader because your money stays at the exchange and the exchange uses an internal ledger to move cryptocurrencies and money from one user to the next. The only fees come from the exchanges, not from the bitcoin network. The only traders who pay fees to the bitcoin network are the ones who take advantage of price differences between exchanges. Buying at the exchange with the cheapest price and selling at the exchange with the highest price requires you to make actual bitcoin transactions as you move your bitcoins from one exchange to the next.;6;2;False;Exotemporal;dqzsddy;New to Bitcoin?

"Not sure if 2020, but at one point in the future, every transaction Homer does will be committed on some underlying blockchain, whether he acknowledges this or not. Instantaneous, nearly-free global transactions are the norm, not the exception, and the added liquidity of the global market leads to a more agile, powerful economy. Homer might not notice this, either, however it will unknowingly improve his standard of living, especially if he lives in a developing country. There are probably no more mammoth banks, just lean institutions for insurances and services. With the banks' power diminished, a strong lobbying force will fall away, and with it its policy influence on governments. This, too, will probably improve Homer's life, without him really acknowledging it.

In an even better case, the blockchain technology will be used for a multitude of other scenarios, from communication between vehicles and smart devices to global data storage and distribution. Perhaps even a decentralised version of the internet. Depending on how ignorant Homer is, he might not notice any of the miraculous things that have changed around him in the world, and not realise his improved quality of life is a direct result of this. But if he's not the town's idiot, then it's improbable he would never come into contact with these technologies.

"I’m very familiar with gold and have been a gold bug for many years.  And not paper gold, only physical bullion and numismatics.  Feel free to check my post history to see that just yesterday in a discussion I noted that, while gold and bitcoin share a striking number of features, one major difference between the two is the millennia of tradition and lore that gold comes with.  Elementally they are completely different, but in terms of the modern uses and features as a store of value, means of exchange, and unit of account they are very similar.  There’s a reason that many of the gold shops I visit now also exchange bitcoin.  Their customers find similar utility in both. It is rational to look at the market for gold, the vast majority of which is not used for any of the industrial or decorative applications you list, as a factor in an educated guess at what the possible market of bitcoin could grow to.

That’s entirely false.  Sure, there can be an infinite number of blockchains, but the breadth and depth of the network is where they derive value.  At the moment, the bitcoin blockchain is the most secured and the most widely used blockchain and thus has the most value.  It has evolved to date to become a very efficient way to complete specific tasks.  Other blockchains exist with different parameters to facilitate different tasks.  The markets decide which are most useful, and the price for the corresponding token to each blockchain is discovered in that manner.  This notion that “the blockchain’s cool but bitcoin sucks” demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.  For a blockchain to be decentralized it must have a token to ensure miners secure it and to allow users to access it.;4;1;False;3domfighter;dr02j23;New to Bitcoin?

"I think this person is referring to economic substitution.

People often compare bitcoin to gold because they're both scarce. But gold is naturally scarce. There's only so much on earth and its costly to extract so its supply is constrained, so it tends to go up in value over time, because even though we keep mining thousands of tons of gold, the number of people who want gold tends to increase faster.

there is no real economic substitute for gold. there's no threat that if someone makes a bunch of iron or aluminum, that people will stop wanting gold because people want gold and iron for different reasons.

gold is pretty unique as far as elements go, and even the metals that share some properties tend to be pretty rare as well.

bitcoin is not naturally scarce, its artificially scarce. 21 million coins is an arbitrary cap, it could be set to 1 trillion coins or no cap at all.

bitcoin also has perfect economic substitutions. You can copy the bitcoin protocol exactly because its open source.

So whatever economic function bitcoin serves is vulnerable to substitution. Currently its main function is to provide speculative returns, however eventually it has to hit a limit on how much money people can keep pumping into it.

If one person owned all the gold in the world, it would still be worth paying him for some because there'd be no other way to get gold. If one person owned all the bitcoin in the world, there'd be no reason to pay him anything for a bitcoin because you could just start your own bitcoin of which you owned all the worlds supply.

That's true, but unlike with FIAT everyone had the exact same chance to buy bitcoin and/or verify transactions in exchange of bitcoin. Getting in early paid off. And yes the governance and mining has become more centralized in the last years, but it's still a very honest, transparent and decentralized system if you compare it to FIAT. Another advantage is that if you have the public and private key of your wallet you'll always have full control over it.

">Decades from now it is likely that some form of crypto will absolutely be used as national currencies

It won't be a hyper-deflationary one that's for sure. Even mild deflation (3% a month) causes chaos in economies. No economy could function on a currency that had 1000%+ deflation, anymore than it could function with 1000% inflation. 

>but there’s no point whatsoever to argue that because today bitcoin isn’t a perfect currency then it has no value

You said its simply an asset class at the moment, so it isn't based on its value as currency. its based on its value as an ""asset class"".

And what is that based on? 1000%+ annual deflation, which is not sustainable. It requires a constant stream of people being willing to pay 10x more for a bitcoin than the last purchaser did. You will very quickly run out of people willing to pay you 10x what you paid, and then what do you have? A hyper-deflationary currency that can handle less than 1% the transactions per second of any major credit card company, with 100x longer waiting times and 100x greater energy costs.

"I think you're missing my point. 

You're mentioning things that are characteristics of the currency because it's based on blockchain. These characteristics give the currency appeal and function, not value. 

A post-dated cheque doesn't have value because of it's features, security, and functions - it's *value* is the cash value assigned to it.  Without assigning any cash value to it (or with bitcoin - if people think it's worth nothing) then it has no other utility and it's value is insignificant/zero. 

The characteristics you mentioned virtually meaningless as a determinant of bitcoins price on any given day. 

And my original point was just that bitcoin is not like gold - it's value is entirely determined by people's opinion of what it's value is at any given time. There is no utility to bitcoin outside of trading (which, for example, gold and most other assets would still have) - that's not a criticism, it's a description. 

> “the blockchain’s cool but bitcoin sucks”

No one said that, no idea where you're getting that from. I'm not saying bitcoin will fail or that I wouldn't invest in to it, so perhaps you misunderstood me.

">The greatest levels of growth and increases in standards of living occurred during the 19th century when gold was money

1. GDP growth was much higher in the 20th century (during the adoption of fiat) than it was in the 19th century. [SOURCE](https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GDP-per-capita-in-the-uk-since-1270.png) The correlation is opposite to what you suggest.

2. Gold was also money for the preceding 2000 years, it was money during the Dark Ages, which was the longest period of economic decline in recorded history. Even if you were right about the 19th century having more growth than the 20th, you can't just pick the industrial revolution and say gold was responsible for the huge growth in living standards and ignore the thousands of years where we had gold and almost no growth in gdp or living standards.

>Since the world moved to a fiat standard the most prosperous nations have become less prosperous, workers wages have stagnated, government spending as a percentage of GDP has risen, the financial sector as a percentage of the economy has tripled, and income inequality has widened.

In order to believe this you have to believe that not a single country in the world, not even micronation tax havens were interested in the massive benefits of remaining on the gold standard, even though getting off the gold standard actually took time and effort.

That no politician is either intelligent or greedy enough to realize that since government money comes from taxing GDP, that if they allow a currency that leads to more GDP growth, their government will become richer and more powerful.

It also involves things like ignoring the fact that the worst economic crisis in US history was caused by hyper-deflation caused by reliance on the gold standard.

"> That's true, but unlike with FIAT everyone had the exact same chance to buy bitcoin

79% of all the bitcoins there will ever be have already been mined, and they're already in the hands of a tiny number of the worlds population.

There's no opportunity cost of not being able to ""buy"" up all the dollars. If you bought dollars a year ago they'd be worth less now so you can't profit just off buying up lots of dollars. No one is getting filthy rich because they bought up 79% of the dollars there will ever be in the first few years of the dollars existence and now can sit back and make millions off other peoples work since they're now forced to buy in at a higher price if they want to use dollars to trade.

The only way you can profit from dollars is to use them to facilitate profitable trade.

>Another advantage is that if you have the public and private key of your wallet you'll always have full control over it. When you put your money on the bank it not only inflates, but you also don't have control over it anymore, you only get the promise that the bank will give you the money when you withdraw.

This isn't a great argument when the number of hacks on exchanges is much greater than the number of hacks on banks. You can say ""don't keep your money in an exchange then"", but you can also say ""don't keep your money in a bank then"".

>When you put your money on the bank it not only inflates, but you also don't have control over it anymore, you only get the promise that the bank will give you the money when you withdraw.

No one should be storing any great amount of wealth in currency. Currency is for spending, not storing. If you have lots of money and you want to store it you should buy something valuable with it and store that.

If you lose 30,000 on bitcoin this year you only get to deduct 3,000 in 2017, and have to carry forward a 27,000 capital loss (assuming you have not capital gains). In 2018 you get to deduct another 3,000 if you have no gains or losses and carry forward the remaining 24,000. If in 2019 you have a 100,000 capital gain on bitcoin then you get to offset the last 24,000 and report a capital gain of only 76,000.

"A correction is just when the market price is above or below ""where it should be"" (aka overpriced or underpriced relative to the actual value) for some time and eventually comes back down/up to ""where it should be."" Often the overpricing or underpricing can be a result of the piece growing too quickly or too slowly. 

Many people agree with bitcoins long-term growth prospects but feel that recently the price has been growing too quickly and that it is therefore likely to be outpacing the actual value, so we could see some sort of correction down to ""where it should be.""

A correction doesn't mean a crash, and it doesn't mean huge fluctuations - it's just a description of the movement of price being back towards reality (actual value.)";6;2;False;SOULJAR;dqzwumb;New to Bitcoin?

"> people aren't just investing in Bitcoin, they are divesting in the current Fiat system

Hmm, not really. Can't think of a many people buying bitcoins for that reasons safe for few libertarians. People buy bitcoin for it's return.

> You can't just keep printing unlimited money that is not backed up by something tangible like gold

That's actually how it works, and it seems to work pretty fine everywhere in the world. Sure, it's not without cons but you can't say it doesn't work.

> Bitcoin differs because there is a set limit of coins that will ever exist.

And that's becoming more of a con than a pro, because it's turning into an investment, rather than a mean to transfer goods.

> It's impossible to make any money with a savings account, and you'll likely lose more in fees and inflation then you'll ever make.

That's because money is a tool for transfering goods and services. Unless you like staring at pictures of deceased national heroes, it's jut paper. It has no intrinsic value. Money has never been an investment. Saving accounts are not meant to make you wealthier unless the % you get outpaces inflation.

But if money wasn't inflative there would be no incentive for spending and economy would turn into shit.

The fact that you know that the house you want to buy for 400k, may cost you 415k next year is what pushes you to buy it now rather than wait.

If you knew that USD had no more supply you'd know that next year you may buy that house 390k, e.g., which actually makes you not spend your money. And guess what? Economy stops moving.

That's exactly what happens with Bitcoin. People just buy them, hold them, rarely spend them. They have no incentive to spending them at all, because they know that if they buy something with it, Bitcoin's value is going to be probably higher (due to very limited supply) at some point.";61;11;False;ep1939;dqzrzb9;New to Bitcoin?

"Not sure about this perspective. 

Bitcoin is not like gold in any sense.

Gold has real value and utility outside of simply trading it. It can be used for many things, from technological applications to jewelery. 

Bitcoin is literally based on nothing but our belief of its worth in trading it. It literally has no value or utility at all outside of Bitcoin trading. You can not make anything out of it - it is literally nothing. Yes it has a limited supply, and can therefore manage its inflation, however unlike with gold a  Bitcoins worth is entirely in people's minds - this is a factor in its price volatility. The limited of supply also increases volatility. ";10;1;False;SOULJAR;dqzxccq;New to Bitcoin?

Sure, BTC could get in to the trillion(s) market cap range, but even for that it's only like a 5-20x situation. Where as the crazy thing about BTC before was that when you invested at $10 or $100, it was semi-plausible that one day BTC would actually go to $10k for a 100-1000x return. The potential upside was insane. 

Pretty much anyone who's not already cash wealthy should be selling down to BTC being a smallish percentage of their portfolio imo.

Businesses are pretty averse to risk (at least the smart ones are), and that's especially true for risk they have absolutely no control over.

"A block is a section of data in the blockchain containing bitcoin transactions. Miners compete to mine blocks, and the miner that successfully mines a block gets the block reward and any transaction fees present in that block. Blocks have a fixed limit to their size, and can only fit so many transactions. Users incentivize miners to include their transactions into the block (making the transaction ""confirmed"") by offering a larger transaction fee. This forms what is called the fee market.

Just one thing.. you mentioned the BCH price. IMO its always best to forget price and focus on the Satoshi's. Based on the Satoshi's BCH has been loosing since the last big pump 4 weeks ago. Whilst Bitcoin has been increasing in value BCH has not followed suit. There are two reasons why this has happened, people have sold off BCH to invest back into BTC, or/and the price is being manipulated through pump and bleeding to purposely maintain the price range. BCH base camp did engage in this type of market manipulation in mid November and also during the August fork, so I wouldn't be surprised if they are doing the same again to install an image of price stability to potential new adopters. ;1;0;False;;dr0h41u;Lightning is going to come really soon!

Definitely not. Trustless off-chain transactions such as those used in Lightning Network are completely consistent with Bitcoin's ideals.

It should be obvious to anyone with a computer science background that decentralized blockchains can't possibly scale to worldwide mainstream adoption without additional layers to offload transactions from the main chain.

There can easily be a market based solution in which people with wallets can broadcast their willingness and capacity to become a lightening node. Larger exchanges are naturally the place to be one. Yes, in the beginning it will not be as decentralized but as soon as more people open up payment channels and are willing to work for a smaller fee, decentralization will naturally follow. Any person with enough funds  can start opening up payment channel with their friends, and eventually friends of friends will naturally go through you to pay bitcoin amongst themselves and charge less than an exchange.

Note that payments on Lightning Network are actually pretty much as secure as on the blockchain.

The only caveat is you need to be prepared to broadcast a transaction on-chain within some time period in the case that one of the nodes you have a channel open with decides to try to screw you over (which is unlikely to begin with because if they fail they lose all of their money in the channel).

Mhmm. Good argument. Then we get our banks back... And the banks are using blockchain to communicate between each other. So I don't see any benefit to our current finance system (SEPA in europe).

">If Bitcoin scales as huge as many of us hope it will, scaling is going to require a lot more than one solution.

According to https://youtu.be/8zVzw912wPo , lightning plus ~133MB blocks will be capable of 2 transactions for *every person on Earth* per day.

And that's without segwit, and without any other efficiency boosts (e.g. Schnoor signatures), which make transaction sizes smaller and thus fit more per MB of block space.

It will be your choice how you want store your funds. How often you want to commit back to the block chain is up to the user. The more often users close a channel and commit back to the block chain the more fees will rise just like today. As fees rise the less often users will want to commit back to the blockchain. On channel TX will be tiny compare to the tx of closing a channel. The market will force everyone on layer 2 technologies. Once layer 2 technology matures users won't want to move back to the blockchain because of the cost of fees and because everyone will be using layer 2. This is just a theory based on the best case scenario of layer 2.

"I do not say LN is not worth implementing. However, the assumption that the current spike is due to people withdrawing Bitcoin is a problem that can **already** be mitigated by TX batching, which saves Blockchain space by 90% or more, by allowing one to send 10x or more transactions using the same space. I highly doubt though, that the congestion is due to Bitcoin withdrawals, mostly.

We need numbers and statistics but intuition says, this is people trying to send their Bitcoin's TO the exchanges, not from. It's more speculative to think that the current spike is because a person is willing to withdraw Bitcoin, and send it to *another* exchange, *using* bitcoin, at the time when 30 dollar fees do not guarantee inclusion within the next blocks, at a time of even higher volatility, and when people are in a hurry I guess to buy some kind of altcoin on some other exchange that the exchange they are does *not* support.

Most people began using ETH or Litecoin to get out of exchanges to **another exchange**, it's much faster, and 100+ times cheaper to move, they have much shorter block times to boot, allowing people to quickly move their funds when speed is important (e.g. for arbitrage)

So, to think that LN will mitigate the current spike, even by 10-20%, is wishful thinking, and, on top of it, a Bitcoin withdrawal spike from central entities can already be dealt with 10x space savings through batching.

The wallet should handle all the background details, and you just worry about spending (and receiving).

Same for LN... those companies are not pioneering in the new protocol. They want to have things working well for their customers. Implementing SegWit now will not do much to help anyway.

"But how many fruits are there for this use case, in the current situation, like /u/nynjawitay asks. It may be used by Exchanges, but I highly doubt the congestion is due to withdrawals, in this case, LN will help in a subset of tx's, and it will open up an additional avenue, not solve the current problem, just like it will add an additionaly avenue for micro and even nano transactions, but not solve the *current* problem.

Also, if the problem is withdrawal from central entitities, like exchanges, of bitcoin, at ATH's, then it's nice to know that you can fit 30 000 tx's batched in 150 groups in a single block:
https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/9fa82d7692ffb845fd2a2bbd601dd090bd53fe2c3b440112afbd214d6e2c3ceb
There you'll see about 150 outputs costing only less that 6Kb for the blockchain...

...*Which means, even if only 1 in 5 tx's are such transactions, using this mitigation method already available, every 5 blocks, 30 000 txo's could be moved into the chain.*

It sounds to me like Lightning network can only help insofar as were concerned with speed and fees. Therefore, I think, as far as fees and speed is concerned, its worth implementing.

It isn't useful for large transactions because you can't expect most channels in the network to operate with large amounts of money (for example, the majority of users have less than 2btc, probably much lower than that even).  IIRC, the lightning network specifications limits channel creation to 0.04btc.
