"Transaction fees were baked into the design by Satoshi.

From the whitepaper:

> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free

The intent was always there to migrate to transaction fees. The issue is just when and how much. And those are free market decisions.

**Bitcoin Helps Venezuelan Families Avoid Starvation** 

https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-helps-venezuelan-families-avoid-starvation/

If you want to buy coffee right now with bitcoin then you have options like getting yourself a bitcoin debit card.  In the meantime you have to accept that bitcoin has grown to the point where it needs off-chain scaling solutions to best cope with the increasing demand.

But don't take my word for it, here's Facebook Executive tech 'expert' Chamath Palihapitiya explaining this much better than I can.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6iIhooV8UY  

""I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. **Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right?** The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? **I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government.** It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. **Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina.** Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, **after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.**"" — Chamath";1;0;False;smeggletoot;dm1298u;:/ That was an expensive coffee I just bought to show a demo transaction.;6vbfip;https://i.redd.it/6axrx39awahz.jpg

">It's very awesome that large transfers can be made rapidly, but the small ones are just as important for the day to day.  

They really arent.  

You are saying that it is just as important to store, forever, duplicated across thousands or (ideally) millions of nodes, every single can of pringles purchased, than, say, every transaction that transfers the ownership of a house. If that is what you mean when you say that ""day to day"" purchases are just as important as ""large amounts"" then I disagree.  


No matter how you cut it, whatever faction, or side you're on, you must agree that main chain (on chain) transactions are not, and can never be unlimited. They are by definition scarce.

"It's a risk, but it's not insurmountable. It the miners start censoring transactions, then the economic majority of node operators can switch the work function, effectively firing the SHA256 miners in favor GPU miners (and that community is gigantic). 

This is why nodes are *extremely important* (and as many as possible) - by serving as the gateways through which users transact with the Bitcoin network, they ensure that miners are producing valid blocks by rejecting invalid blocks, that miners continue to serve the interests of the users. Nodes and users establish bitcoin's value and exchange price, and as history proves, hashrate follows price.

Since each block only has so much room, miners will take the transactions with the highest fees first since it is in their interest. They don't have to, it just makes financial sense.

So you could put a no fee transaction in, and if it wasn't competing with other transactions, it would probably get added to a block.

"There are many simultaneous attacks on Bitcoin going on:

 - Social network attacks - this post has more upvotes than the number of users that typically vote on all posts in a day... clearly manipulated.

 - Promotion of BCH And SW2X and other forks - these are coins with little/no real-world use dominating new releases, press and attention.   (BCH is literally slower and more expensive to use than DOGE coin.)

 - Mempool stuffing and fee attacks - any casual glance at mempool sizes and fee charts will reveal that the recent spike from $1 to $5 fees was not ""organic growth"".   This is an attack.   The fees are the cost that users pay to defend against it.  

I would fully expect these to culminate at the next BCH difficulty adjustment with an even more aggressive narrative, maybe an exchange hack (exit scam) or something to spice things up.

Seems like the other responses are responding to the rest of your comment, but no one answered the question yet.

No matter what or why OP posted, the response that they completely failed to hide their transaction (and by extension, address(es)) is a valid security concern from a user perspective.  They effectively just gave us a social media account (even though Reddit is semi-anonymous, enough data can likely be pieced together to figure out identity on a long enough timeline), and at least one BTC address linked to their identity (either sender or receiver - even if the receiver is a friend as they said that's someone linked to the user that we now have the address of).

Given that the block chain is a public ledger of all BTC moving around the network, it starts to become susceptible to analytics.  With as much profiling as can be done via social media, imagine if Facebook or Google had all of your banking information, not just who you paid, but who they paid, and so on.  Given that OP posted enough of their transaction information to reveal addresses, I highly doubt they've tumbled their BTC too, making them even less anonymous/secure.

Seeing these transaction costs, and the pavlovian responses that people present, is not only new to me, but in my opinion misguided and alarming. I chose to reply to your comment since it's the most sensible I've read here, and have actual arguments. So apologies if a little off topic, I'm basing my answer on what I've read in the thread.

> It's a global approach to money that's aimed at removing power from those who manipulate national economies for political and profiteering reasons.

Bitcoin makes very little difference as a savings account. Silver and gold have been available since the inception of human modernity, yet your average Joes don't use it to preserve value.

I'd argue that if your goal is to reduce governmental control, you cannot do it without solving the coffee problem. Why? Because the government gets their purchasing power through taxes – **human transactions** – and inflation. Not by looting people's gold savings and real estate. The average worker doesn't care about savings. They spend as much as they make. For every salary cycle, the average Joe pays half of their income for the government to spend at their discretion. Inflation and taxes on that alone is enough to sustain the military industrial complex on steroids. The currency which you pay your coffee barista with will be the same currency as you pay your military personell. As long as government leeches off your **everyday transactions**, including your salary, your rent, your mortgage payments, your clothes and ultimately, your coffee, it is business as usual as far as the government is concerned.

> If this means that the blockchain itself only becomes a settlement layer and a way for rich entities to transport large sums of money then that's ok. It means that bitcoin has won.
