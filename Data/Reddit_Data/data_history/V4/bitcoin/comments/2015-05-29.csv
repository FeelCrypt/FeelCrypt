Sorry, but when your friend used heroin, he did it by his own choice. No one forced him to shoot-up. Blaming the drugs is a coward's excuse, and I've never known an addict who blamed the drugs or the dealers instead of himself. The point is about the freedom we should all have to live the way we choose. Drug use is called a victimless crime because taking drugs doesn't hurt anyone other than the user. ;2;1;False;magrathea1;crp8h7t;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

I'm shaking in my boots now. Terrorism killed more people than lightning strikes last year.

""Enabling terrorism"" is a pathetic excuse to send someone to a rape cage for the rest of their life.

You mean like alcohol and nicotine? By your logic those should be illegal, and those that sell them should do life in prison. Sickening.

I'm sorry for your friend's problems, but obviously the war on drugs which has been ruining lives for the past 30 years did nothing to stop his addiction from developing.

"I won't downvote you but I will correct you.

First off there is substantial doubt that Ross actually ran the site. He created it originally, and was later roped into some moderation right before he was arrested. The murder for hire allegations were bait and switch as he was never actually charged with them. It was probably done to sway public perception against him. His trial wasn't very fair and it's easy to see that government had pre-determined verdict against him in hope of making an example of him.

>Bombs and plastic explosives

>guns that could have been used to kill people.

These things were only briefly available on silk road at the beginning of its existence but were quickly banned.

As for your argument against extremely addictive drugs, nobody is saying these things are safe. We're talking about harm reduction not harm removal. I believe these drugs should be legal so we can address the abusive of such as a mental health issue not a criminal issue. The silk road provided access to predictable quality while eliminating turf violence and organized crime components of traditional drug crime. 

The silk road didn't suddenly make drugs harmless, it was simply a much lesser evil when compared to the alternatives. 

The sentence against him was not prudent or appropriate but rather vindictive and set as a deterrent against anyone else who wishes to challenge the government on personal freedom enabled by the internet.

I said addicts, totally different from drug use which I condone wholeheartedly. Choice is fundamentally important and at the heart of personal freedom, and my point is drug addicts don't have the wherewithal to choose if sufficiently addicted. Go talk to former drug addicts, they'll tell you it's a sickness they couldn't control. Furthermore your gun comment speaks to the possibility that you just spew whatever rhetoric you've heard countless times and automatically label people with opposing views as evil statists. I totally disagree with the current approach but I think saying that a drug addict should have the right to choose to take drugs is fundamentally ignorant in that addicts aren't exercising choice.  That was my point. I'm not advocating that I should take control of how you choose to live your life but rather that it's bullshit to say a drug addict is choosing anything and the alternative of absolute anarchy is the definitive answer to our society's flaws. And it's funny because you're accusing me of trying to prescribe how the world should function yet you yourself are actively prescribing a way the world should be.

"Obviously there is a difference between low-opportunity individuals without parents, income or shelter, who sniff glue all day and take crack, versus a working professional who takes some pot twice a month to relax and is supplied by a registered dealer who gets quality controlled by the state.

i.e. no different from the role of regular medicine, or recreational alcohol. All of them, if abused, have negative externalities. And that abuse did exist and was facilitated by the SR, like the one kid who overdosed on heroin and whose parents testified against Ross. You may argue SR doesn't bear responsibility, that's fine, but you can't argue the problems aren't there. And if the problems do exist, one ought to think about how to best tackle them.

And a silk road is not the best way to tackle that problem. It's far less preferable to the system we have here in the Netherlands where softdrugs are a legal part of life, generate tax revenues which are spent on education, work programmes, quality inspections, research, non-profit anti-addiction programmes etc. The silk road challenges some of the problems (stuff like getting stabbed as a dealer or by a dealer) but is not a comprehensive solution.

The SR has its place I think, especially in oppressive societies concerning drugs (US being a prime example sadly). But it's not the perfect solution people make it out to be. Regardless, it appears Ross did some fucked up shit beyond providing a platform for drug sales for which some punishment is warranted. If you accept the evidence, then the judge's statement that Ross commissioned five murders to protect his enterprise, is not something you let off with a slap on the wrist.

"> I thought a crime was supposed to have a victim?

Legally? Nope. In the US all you need to pass a law is rational basis, i.e. you need to show that a reasonable person might believe that the government has an interest in banning the sale of drugs. Selling drugs is illegal, Silk Road was an organization that helped people and sell drugs and directly benefited from the sales of drugs, Ulbricht was at the head of Silk Road. Ergo Ulbricht was at the head of a criminal enterprise and, legally, life is pretty reasonable. 


If anything good comes out of this there will be a push to liberalize drug laws in the US, but I highly enough people will care. In the meantime it sucks for Ulbricht but, frankly, founding a site like Silk Road in the US was really dumb. It was inevitable that he'd get caught eventually.

"The point is that the logic is flawed and it would be equally absurd to punish doctors, pharmacists, and companies on the same grounds.  Doctors, pharmacists, and companies are dishing out drugs which are deemed *legal* and they have licenses to do so.  Silk Road dealt both legal and illegal drugs, but the vendors obviously did not have licenses to do so nor did they go through the proper procedures in lending the drugs out, obviously.  The issue that arises is the absurdity of the Scheduling of drugs in the United States and the overall hypocrisy of the system.  

So yes, I appreciate the attempt to kill my statements, but I'm really not that stupid.  I believe, under the current laws, that Ross was guilty of crimes and that he knows that himself.  The questions become whether these laws are fair and carry out their purposes properly.  This is in regards only to the drug trafficking charges.

The only reason he didn't actually have them killed is that he was talking to an FBI operation pretending to be a hitman. The FBI even sent him photos that looked like a successful kill and he was fine with that.

First, where is your proof of deaths related to SR purchases? The hits on record were fake if i recall correctly. Also, given two situations: buying drugs, weapons etc in person or remotely (online), which would you personally feel less safe doing? People could purchase all of these things before online marketplaces existed and they still can now without using the web. I (among many others) would argue that if anything Ross created a safer environment than what had existed before. Regardless however, going back to the main point you commented on, prohibition does NOT work in human society (if you want proof, attend history classes). There have been and will be ZERO exceptions to this, no matter how niche or secular, if someone wants something bad enough, they will get it, laws & regulations make no difference to them.

"Oh dear god. You guys are creating more and more comedy gold by the second. His sentencing was due to running a criminal enterprise which included murder for hire. It does NOT matter that it was not what the original charge was for. This is the sentencing summary. Do all of you here really just jerk each other off with absolutely incorrect information and repeat it over and over? 

>He proved quite ruthless in seeking to protect his illegal empire, attempting on multiple occasions to solicit murders for hire in order to deal with perceived threats to his operation. At trial, the Government introduced evidence of five of those attempted murders-for-hire. (GX-936). As the Government made clear, no one, thankfully, was actually killed as a result of Ulbricht’s actions; the “hitman” involved in these five attempts appears to have been a conman.
But – contrary to Ulbricht’s absurd suggestion in his sentencing submission that these murder-for-hire attempts were mere “masquerade” or “role-playing,” (Def.’s Ltr. dated May 22, 2015, at 37) – Ulbricht clearly believed that all of the murders were real and intended for them to occur.

Because a majority of your democratically-elected representatives in Congress voted to make them legal/illegal, and it was then signed by the President, in accordance with the Constitution. That's as good as it gets. You can work to peacefully change the law, or practice civil disobedience and do your protesting from jail. While a good part of society may want to legalize marijuana, they probably don't think it's worth going to jail over, and would rather let peaceful change take its course. Something that basic human rights may be worth fighting over, but smoking marijuana is not one of them.

"It was submitted as evidence in this trial though, and the defense ~~did nothing to counter it~~ claimed that it was role-playing (WTF?). [It was even mentioned at sentencing.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/266723681/Ulbricht-Prosecution-Sentencing-Letter)

> Indeed, behind the mask of the “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ulbricht cultivated a darker side of his personality, one that his friends and family – and even “DPR’s” admirers on Silk Road – would have found shocking. He proved quite ruthless in seeking to protect his illegal empire, attempting on multiple occasions to solicit murders for hire in order to deal with perceived threats to his operation. At trial, the Government introduced evidence of five of those attempted murders-for-hire. (GX-936). As the Government made clear, no one, thankfully, was actually killed as a result of Ulbricht’s actions; the “hitman” involved in these five attempts appears to have been a conman. But – contrary to Ulbricht’s
absurd suggestion in his sentencing submission that these murder-for-hire attempts were mere “masquerade” or “role-playing,” (Def.’s Ltr. dated May 22, 2015, at 37) – Ulbricht clearly believed that all of the murders were real and intended for them to occur. He paid for them with $650,000 in Bitcoins – transferred directly from a Bitcoin wallet on his laptop.^(16) He coldly noted the arrangement and execution of the murders-for-hire in entries in his “log” file on his computer.^(17) And he excitedly reported one of the murders-for-hire in a chat with “VJ.”^(18) Ironically, in his public pronouncements on Silk Road in the voice of “DPR,” Ulbricht portrayed himself as a champion of “freedom” on the Silk Road website, opposed to the use of any kind of “force” against others. In truth, Ulbricht was just as willing as a traditional kingpin to use intimidation and violence in furtherance of his criminal enterprise.^(19)

> -----

> ^(16) (Tr. dated Jan. 2, 2015, at 1727:21-1732:13; GX-601; GX-630; GX-631; GX-936 at 22, 31).

> ^(17) *See* GX-240 (“being blackmailed with user info,” “commissioned hit on blackmailer with [hell’s] angels,” “got word that blackmailer was ex[e]cuted,” “received visual confirmation of blackmailers execution”).

> ^(18) *See* GX-227D (“I get blackmailed by a guy saying he's in deep shit with hell’s angels . . . i
said, have the hells angels contact me so i can work something out . . . very foolishly he did . . .
they said they caught up with lucy, got the product back and killed him”)

> ^(19) Accordingly, there is no basis for Ulbricht’s objection to the PSR’s inclusion of a Guidelines enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(2), which applies “[i]f the defendant used violence, made a credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of violence.” (Def.’s Ltr. dated May 22, 2015, at 80). As its plain terms make clear, the enhancement does not require that violence actually occur, but only that violence be credibly intended. *See United States v. Harris*, 578 Fed. Appx. 451, 453-54 (5th Cir. 2014) (affirming application of enhancement even though “there was no actual drug stash” that defendant intended to rob, explaining: “ the enhancement's view that higher sentences are warranted for those with a propensity for violence — even if just reflected in a threat and not an actual act of violence — is implicated even when the threat occurs in connection with a sting”). Moreover, contrary to Ulbricht’s argument that the murder-for-hire solicitations constitute uncharged conduct that cannot be factored into his base offense level, the solicitations were specifically charged as an overt act of the alleged narcotics conspiracy. *See* Indictment S1 14 Cr. 68 (KBF) ¶¶ 16.b & 16.c. Moreover, all relevant conduct, whether charged or uncharged, must be considered in calculating Ulbricht’s base offense level in any event. *See* U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a). Notably, Ulbricht does not challenge any other aspect of the Guidelines calculation in the PSR. The Government agrees with the calculation in its entirety.

Pretty damning if you ask me. The whole letter is a good read, and shows just what he is responsible for.

1. The crime absolutely did affect his sentencing. 

2. There's no way they bring charges against Ross now that he's got a life sentence. 

From the DA's sentencing summary: 

> He proved quite ruthless in seeking to protect his illegal empire, attempting on multiple occasions to solicit murders for hire in order to deal with perceived threats to his operation. At trial, the Government introduced evidence of five of those attempted murders-for-hire. (GX-936). As the Government made clear, no one, thankfully, was actually killed as a result of Ulbricht’s actions; the “hitman” involved in these five attempts appears to have been a conman.

> But – contrary to Ulbricht’s absurd suggestion in his sentencing submission that these murder-for-hire attempts were mere “masquerade” or “role-playing,” (Def.’s Ltr. dated May 22, 2015, at 37) – Ulbricht clearly believed that all of the murders were real and intended for them to occur. He paid for them with $650,000 in Bitcoins – transferred directly from a Bitcoin wallet on his laptop. He coldly noted the arrangement and execution of the murders-for-hire in entries in his “log” file on his computer.

"Can you murder me and my family? Sure, you could. The concept of self ownership is the understanding that I have the natural right to defend myself and my family, with force. You would be the aggressor, I would justifiably defend myself and my family from your initiation of force.

The state doesn't recognize your right to defend yourself, your family, your property(taxation) or use your body in whatever way you see fit(drug use, prostitution).

Example: 'Prostitution'(direct, un-taxed payment for sexual favors) is prohibited by the state. Pornography is not(licensing/taxation are involved)

The war on drugs has been raging for what, 80 yrs? Do you believe the state doesn't simply convince the public, through indoctrination, to allow them to continue to borrow from central banks to fund the war on drugs? Legalized drug use for all is certainly not in the best interest of the state. Firstly, it is difficult to near impossible to collect tax on drugs, especially those that can be grown in a basement. Second, and most important, drugs alter your mind from doing what the state has programmed us all to do....focus on the production and consumption of goods and services.

The mass production and consumption of goods and services is the 'oil to the machine' of a society based on inflation. Spend, spend spend. Borrow, borrow borrow. 

The state realized long ago, that direct enslavement wasn't productive... so they switched to a different model. Giving you just enough 'rights' to make you 'happy'.

Mmm I'm kinda in doubt about that. First off, it needs to be true (i.e., not a lie/twisted words/etc.). Second: It could be a setup - maybe he was in extreme stress and desperate or something.

please.  Prescription overdoses cause [44 deaths per day](http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/public.html) in the United States alone.  If you're going to apply this logic to Ross, then it should be applied to the doctors that order the prescriptions, the pharmacists that hand them out, and the companies that make them.
