"I don't disagree with you, but good luck convincing those who have the wealth that they need to give up some of it.

I do find it interesting that, in a sense, the pro-libertarian mindset that drives Bitcoin also complains about inequitable distribution of wealth, which is essentially often a liberal/left position. Instead of advocating government intervention by force to redistribute wealth (the hard leftist position) the libertarian position seems to be to deconstruct the entire system to allow people to have the freedom to interact as they see fit -- and in effect end with the same kind of redistribution of wealth across the classes.

"Let's say that I'm a bank with 100 btc, and you have 0 btc. You want to buy a house at 10 btc, so you borrow 10 btc from me and promise to pay back 11 btc in one year. I repeat this process, earning 10% each year on whatever I loan to you and your friends. You will have a harder and harder time finding that extra 10% in the ""market"" because I am getting more and more btc, and the rest of the market is getting less and less. At some point, the collective amount of interest owed will be larger than the amount of btc in the market. And that is when it is impossible to pay back the loan with interest.

This is why we have fractional reserve banking. And that's why we have inflation.

Now don't misunderstand me; a lot of people probably think this is a good outcome. I'm just saying that if btc where the main currency, then we will not be borrowing money to buy houses and cars.

"I applaud Coinbase for this policy (although I dislike them calling 2X ""Bitcoin <something>"").

One thing remains to be clarified: Will users be able to safely deposit both Bitcoin+2X funds to Coinbase *with a single replayed transaction*? For example, if Joe's wallet is entirely unsplit, can Joe send his funds to Coinbase using his regular Bitcoin wallet, and get a deposit credited for both the bitcoins and the associated/replayed 2X funds?

This would require the exchange to simply respect the same deposit addresses on both chains, as valid deposits for the same users. It would also require care to allow for the same txid (on different chains) to appear as multiple deposits.

https://blog.coinbase.com/clarification-on-the-upcoming-segwit2x-fork-d3c0f545c3e0

Clarification on the upcoming Segwit2x Fork

In our prior blog post we indicated that at the time of the fork, the existing chain will be called Bitcoin and the Segwit2x fork will be called Bitcoin2x.

However, some customers asked us to clarify what will happen after the fork. **We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.**

We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability.

It‚Äôs important for us to keep a neutral position in any fork. We believe that letting the market decide is the best way to ensure that Bitcoin remains a fair and open platform.
