They will abandon fiat if bitcoin can scale. If you can send transactions quickly and at a low fee (I‚Äôm aware you can‚Äôt right now) anywhere in the world then people will use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not taking shortcuts like other cryptos. It is trying to scale in a decentralized way while maintaining security. This is very difficult to do, thus it will not happen overnight. Bigger blocks is a band-aid solution. Side-chains seem to be promising but there are no guarantees, and it has to work the first time the devs cant afford to f*ck up. Again, the internet was not developed over night, it took many years to be user friendly. Bitcoin has similar problems and potential.;1;0;False;klebber;drq0o2f;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

">People are buying as speculators because they hope that bitcoin tech will continue to develop with LN and atomic swaps

They're buying because they believe it will be worth more next month/year than it is this month/year.

Speculators don't care why that is, whether its because bitcoin is useful or will be useful, or whether its just valuable because of a speculative bubble.

If it was based on the potential long term success of bitcoin then you wouldn't see wild swings because that potential is the same now as it has always been.

>Of course today Bitcoin is not very useful. One day it could be a functioning worldwide currency

And one day it might be worthless. 

It's a mistake to confuse the price of a speculative asset for its future usefulness/success. There are no underlying indicators beyond price to indicate that bitcoin is improving. Market share is down. Transaction times are down. Merchant adoption in the top 500 US retailers is down. Fees are up. Volatility is up.

If it was simply as easy as picking the most valuable/rapidly appreciating assets then everyone would be rich.

It doesn't matter what happens to bitcoins price. Hyper-deflationary currencies don't work and no amount of speculation will change that.

>Employers will pay employees in bitcoin if bitcoin has mainstream usage. Customers will pay bitcoin , and employers wont bother to convert it to fiat or another currency because thats a waste of time.

This is circular logic. ""people will use bitcoin if people use bitcoin"".

Why would they ever abandon fiat? ""because its a store of value""

Okay so buy the store of value with fiat and then continue using fiat as a currency.

No one will try to spend a currency that appreciates when they have access to a currency that depreciates.

This is why gold coins are no longer used as currency but iron and copper based coins are still in use after thousands of years. It's not because Iron or copper are any more frangibile or portable than gold coins. It's because gold appreciates in value too rapidly to be useful as a currency.";1;1;False;suninabox;drpykr6;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

"> Bitcoin absolutely does have the most predictable stable monetary policy of any currency that has ever existed. I challenge you to explain to me how I'm wrong in that assertion. Throwing those insults just embarasses yourself.

One it's not a monetary policy and its predictability is based on sliding difficulty to keep the average daily mining rate constant. If the US government wanted to set a finite amount of dollars it could also release 7200 dollars a day until May of 2140. You should ask yourself why they wouldn't do that and you'll possibly begin to understand how ridiculous you sound and what's wrong with your assertion.";1;1;False;Scared_of_stairs_LOL;drq1tax;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

"Hi Pine¬† üçç, 
Hope you went through my comment which I emailed to you regarding screening some African based charities which are worth recommending and are definitely doing what they say they are doing in their communities ... As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.

There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.

"I see a few facts that assure me Bitcoin is not going to disappear
1. It's an industry...not a fad. This is it, cryptocurrency is here and will be around forever. This is just the beginning. 
2. Miner's control the industry...not the Bitcoin buyers/speculators. At this point there are hundreds if not thousands of companies that are now investing millions of dollars into mining cryptocurrency. They're not doing it with the expectation of it dropping to zero. Nor will they allow it. I know a husband and wife that were attorneys and closed their practice to buy servers that are now crowding their entire living room mining Bitcoin. When one blockchain is worth $250,000 the big boys take notice.
3. James Dimon threatens to fire employees that are trading Bitcoin..., that means there must be a ton of Traders trading Bitcoin. Traders trade to make money, not to lose it.
4. The Winklevoss twins became Bitcoin billionaires... there must be hundreds of Wall Streeters that have 10 to 50 million dollars that will do anything to be billionaires too. They're going to do everything they can to get a piece of the pie. They want to be billionaires far more than we want to be millionaires. We just have to ride their coattails.
5. The Wall Streeters are here to stay... these guys love volatile markets. They have computer software with algorithms that will make billions off of Bitcoin volatility. They're loving this ride
6. Twenty five coins awarded to miners... for each Bitcoin blockchain a miner gets  25 Bitcoins. This lasts till 2020 then it goes to 12.5 coins. Whatever they're worth today they will have to be worth twice as much in 2020 for minors to continue investing in servers to mine cryptocurrency. Right now people want to mine as much as possible before 2020 to maximize their ROI. 
7. Satoshi intentionally designed his code so that one Bitcoin would ultimately be worth $1,000,000....0.00000349 x 1,000,000 = 3.49.  I'm only assuming that he expected Bitcoiners to buy a burger for 349 micros. Otherwise the last digit has no value. 
8. Unfortunately we're at the beginning of the revolution. And that means there's going to be hell to pay for those that are part of the revolution. Governments will rise against cryptos, and only our children and children's children we'll see the full extent of cryptocurrencies success. We're going to get our asses kicked so we must stick together to win this revolution. 

In the end 21 million Bitcoins will be minted which means there's a potential for 21 million millionaires to be made. Being most people hold more than 2 Bitcoins, chances are there's only going to be a few million millionaires made. Stay in the game

Many Bitcoin men have been sent to jail and many more will follow. This is a movement for the common man, we must never give up. The future of generations around the world are depending on us to succeed.

I know I sound like I'm babbling but there's going to be a war over Bitcoin someday and we need to be strong in order to Win It...HODL";6;3;False;aquahealer;drqo12d;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"you wont be able to do the assignments, but they arent that interesting or difficult from a programmers perspective anyways.

the first week or two is fairly technical, but the course goes more high level after that. i suspect that even without much technical background youll get a fair amount out of the class. thats being said, if you can understand hash functions and how/why they are being used, youll gain a better understanding and appreciation of whats happening under the covers.

"> counterfeiting

Effectively, you're saying that a currency being able to be exchanged through a physical medium is a bad thing? Having all currency be digital isn't anywhere near realistic, and there's no real (well, financially viable, anyway) way of making a counterfeit-proof physical currency.

Counterfeiting also has a very miniscule economic effect, so the argument that it's some major drag on the economy doesn't work, either.

>inflation

Controlled inflation is not an inherently bad thing at all. And, economically speaking, it's *much* better than deflation.

With deflation, when you have outstanding debt, the value of that debt increases, leading to a higher percent of total debt being defaulted on. Overall it's terrible for the economy. Controlled inflation is the opposite, and does no harm.

What's your actual argument here?

"Because the investor using the mortgage money to mass-buy $75K of BTC  at $19K/Unit was a very strong expression of **opinion**  that at SOME POINT between now and the end of your investment horizon period the buyer expects that the BTC units being purchased will have a worth at not only MORE than $19K/Unit but SO MUCH MORE as to deem the inherent risks worth it.

Given the volatility of BTC,  if you make a single large purchase of BTC on one date,  and have a very small investment horizon then you have a very HIGH chance of losing.

However, given the volatility of BTC, if you make a purchase and have a very LONG investment horizon before you need to spend the funds, such as a year or longer, or perhaps two years, then it is MUCH more probable that at some time during your investment period  the units of BTC will be worth $19K or more again,  so that you will have opportunities to sell at zero loss or a gain on your investment.

FOR EXAMPLE:  If you took this $75K mortgage back in 2016 and have been holding them for an entire year,  then you have a very high probability of having appreciated BTC that you could technically sell at a profit today.

"> We don't print endlessly? Have we ever stopped, I'm confused?

Of course you're confused, because you make no effort to understand monetary policy, and then declare that it's broken because you don't understand it.

We don't print endlessly, because the amount of money printed yearly is very carefully controlled. It's specifically there to offset the money destroyed and increase inflation at carefully controlled rates.

Small amounts of inflation are also good for the economy. Saving or holding money does not stimulate the economy, but spending it does. A small amount of inflation incentivizes people to invest and spend their money rather than holding it, so that they can make more money instead of having their money be worth less.

>You do realize that majority of the money we 'borrow' is actually just being borrowed from ourselves. (Which means we print more money to cover the amount we are borrowing from ourselves haha)

Yes, most U.S. debt is intra-government debt. But these are separate organizations. Agencies borrow from the Social Security fund, for example, because that's profitable.

Your objection to intra-government debt doesn't even make sense.

>The Federal Reserve being created combined with dropping Gold behind the dollar has a direct correlation with the lead up to the Great Depression.

1\. The gold standard was dropped *after* the start of the Great Depression. And, all U.S. dollars could be exchanged for gold until Nixon stopped that program as the U.S. started to run out of gold.

The gold standard was abandoned for a reason. It would have been literally unsustainable. We simply did not have enough gold to cover it.

2\. The Federal Reserve was created before the Great Depression, sure. But where's your proof that that had anything to do with the depression?

The Great Depression was caused by a huge stock market crash, and the subsequent failure by the banking system to meet the liquidity demands of those trying to withdraw money. The Fed has little to nothing to do with that. I know it's probably a tempting bogeyman, but if you're going to blame the Federal Reserve for one of the most-studied economic disasters in history, you should probably provide some sort of proof.

>We had never had a 'Great Depression' until the federal reserve decided to drop gold, inflate the money supply, manipulate the interest rates and then of course, FDR's stimulus package caused the entire economy to go from depression to great depression.

Not only do you completely lack any sort of understanding of fiscal and monetary policy, your entire timeline of Depression- to WWII-era America is just straight-up wrong too.

>Obviously a ton more details into this but if you try to tell me none of what I just said has anything to do with it then you really don't need to respond to this anymore.

I mean, you're just throwing around words and names without actually knowing anything about it. You're remaining willfully ignorant instead of just doing some sort of basic research.

The abandonment of the gold standard *couldn't* have caused the Great Depression, since it happened afterwards. Plus, after the gold standard was dropped, the U.S. dollar could still be redeemed for gold. So, the Fed set interest rates for lending, but your assertion that either of these led to the Depression makes no sense.

The Great Depression -- this isn't my opinion, this is fact -- was caused by a) a lack of liquidity within banks and b) an enormous stock market crash. Neither of those directly relate to the Federal Reserve of the time, nor the gold standard, nor anything the FDR did.

I'm not here to debate whether you like government assistance programs or not, but empirically, New Deal programs *did* have a positive effect on the economy. Claiming they took the economy ""from depression to great depression"" is just not backed up by the numbers.

>So essentially everything you told me the Central Banks are great for I'm telling they aren't great for.

Right, but your arguments are based on either a wrong timeline or a gross misunderstanding of what caused the U.S.'s major financial crises.

>Remember, over half the US's history had no federal reserve and the dollar was backed by Gold not just the government...

Right, until the gold standard became literally impossible. [Read about what happened before Nixon stopped guaranteeing USD -> gold exchanges.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock#Background)

>By 1966, non-US central banks held $14 billion, while the United States had only $13.2 billion in gold reserve. Of those reserves, only $3.2 billion was able to cover foreign holdings as the rest was covering domestic holdings.[6]

>By 1971, the money supply had increased by 10%.[7] In May 1971, West Germany left the Bretton Woods system, unwilling to revalue the Deutsche Mark.[8] In the following three months, this move strengthened its economy. Simultaneously, the dollar dropped 7.5% against the Deutsche Mark.[8] Other nations began to demand redemption of their dollars for gold. Switzerland redeemed $50 million in July.[8] France acquired $191 million in gold.[8] On August 5, 1971, the United States Congress released a report recommending devaluation of the dollar, in an effort to protect the dollar against ""foreign price-gougers"".[8] On August 9, 1971, as the dollar dropped in value against European currencies, Switzerland left the Bretton Woods system.[8] The pressure began to intensify on the United States to leave Bretton Woods.

Countries began leaving the system, bringing down the value of the dollar. Plus, we literally didn't have enough gold to keep the Bretton Woods system alive. It would have been impossible.

You'd know that if you even had any idea what you were talking about.

>I don't trust a government to control inflation or deflation. I really don't trust someone controlling the supply of money and therefore an economy as a whole.

Well then don't pretend your objection is any more than anti-intellectualism. You don't understand monetary or fiscal policy, so you conclude that it must be bad and evil and ruining the economy.

>I don't care what ""smart or smarter"" people are thinking up to tell you some bullshit for why we need to print more money.

So this is where you imply that you're right because you ""think for yourself"", right? And everyone else is a sheep?

>Just as many smart people say this can't sustain itself.

Lol, like who? They really don't. No major economists believe that the current monetary system of fiat currencies is inherently unsustainable or something like that.

>No one actually knows what will happen in the future. The same way no one knows what will happen with Crypto. 

I can tell you exactly what will happen with crypto. It's a bubble. It's terrible as a currency because it encourages holding, not spending, which is bad for the economy. It's not sustainable because the only thing holding the price up, undeniably, is speculation. There is nothing backing it if it fails. Eventually, it will crash, and just like the unregulated nature of the financial system led to the Great Depression, with no central bank or government to set policy to help it recover, people will lose a lot of money.

"> I love the idea of controlled inflation like that exists.

‚Ä¶Are you trying to claim that the Federal Reserve cannot target a specific rate of inflation, usually pretty successfully? If you are, you're just straight-up wrong.

>Are you really trying to tell me inflation causes no harm and is good for the economy? I believe many countries would disagree with you on this one.

Are you talking about hyperinflation like Zimbabwe had? Yes, that's harmful. Obviously nobody's saying otherwise. 

However, inflation is not inherently bad. You can't just chock it up to a difference of opinion, really. From a *quantitative* and *mathematical* perspective, controlled inflation does not cause significant harm to the economy. Especially compared to deflation like Bitcoin.

On top of that, targeting a specific rate of inflation allows the central bank to control the money supply more freely, letting them invest in a countercyclical fashion, providing liquidity to markets and restraining speculation during booms while stimulating markets during recessions. A central bank is an overwhelmingly positive thing, and in general central banks target specific inflation rates because they have good reason to.

>The US dollar is trustworthy today. Sure. You act as if the US will last forever and never crumble, fail or fall.

‚Ä¶No I didn't, I didn't even imply anything like this.

However I'd like to point out that if the U.S. government failed, the U.S. dollar would have exactly the same number of reputable organizations backing it as Bitcoin, which you're claiming *is* actually usable as a currency.

>The idea of nothing backed, fiat paper money is brand new to economics and no one knows where this is going.

Just because you don't understand monetary policy doesn't mean nobody does.

Also, if you think fiat currency is ""nothing-backed"", you're again just straight-up wrong. Fiat currencies are backed by governments, which is literally the whole point of them. 

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a ""currency"" that is *actually* nothing-backed. Nothing gives Bitcoin inherent value except for the fact that people are willing to pay money for it. This is actually in almost complete *contrast* to fiat currencies.

>We just print money endlessly.

If you think this, no wonder you don't think controlled inflation is possible.

No, we don't print money endlessly. A lot of very smart people -- smarter than you and me -- decide how much money to print and at what rates to lend it, in order to create sustainable markets. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's not a sound system.

>We borrow money FROM OURSELVES! 

What are you even saying? Who does?

>While at the same time, technology is only growing faster, stronger and will eventually completely take over our daily life making the idea of a digital currency not so crazy after all.

It's more that the value of a dollar changes over time, so even looking at the value of a Bitcoin as static (I.e.

"100% depends on the jurisdiction. Each state, county, and city has entirely different rules. 

California has very squatter-friendly laws. It can take as long as a year to get someone evicted. 

A place like New York State is amazing, where NYC itself has different laws from upstate despite being state mandated. In upstate, there are different laws in some of the cities. Syracuse and Albany have their own city codes regarding the matter. 

But once about 5 years ago, I hadn‚Äôt payed rent by the time the leasing office had closed at 5pm. At 5:30 when I got home (I was stuck at work) there was a notice of eviction saying I had 24 hours to pay rent, plus a $100 fee, or they would then refuse any future payment and I would have to be out in 10 days. So it can be that quick. I looked into the laws, and sure enough, after that 24 hour period, they could refuse payment and get a court order. At the end of that 10 day period they could show up with a sheriff and throw my shit to the curb.

The fees and drama are pushing me away from Bitcoin day after day.

I don‚Äôt see it becoming a currency at all at this rate, although it is a great store of value and may be good for international remissions (even with the ridiculous fees, depending on the amount being sent). In my eyes, bitcoin has paved the way for a better cryptocurrency to take its place.

"Hold Up. The central bank is a good thing!? We don't print endlessly? Have we ever stopped, I'm confused? You don't even realize that we borrow money to pay for our budget? You do realize that majority of the money we 'borrow' is actually just being borrowed from ourselves. (Which means we print more money to cover the amount we are borrowing from ourselves haha) If this doesn't make sense to you, then go look it up and dive deeper into the mess that is our federal reserve...The Federal Reserve being created combined with dropping Gold behind the dollar has a direct correlation with the lead up to the Great Depression. We had never had a 'Great Depression' until the federal reserve decided to drop gold, inflate the money supply, manipulate the interest rates and then of course, FDR's stimulus package caused the entire economy to go from depression to great depression. Obviously a ton more details into this but if you try to tell me none of what I just said has anything to do with it then you really don't need to respond to this anymore.

No.... there's always a chance during the highly volatile period that you got unlucky and purchased at a local maximum;  whether you ultimately have a gain or not will depend primarily on whether your thesis was correct about the trend though.

People cope with high short-term volatility by  making sure not to buy their entire initial investment at the same price....  for example:  If time horizon is   36 months and you have $75K total to put in,  then people divide that lump sum such as into  8    $9,3750  investments   to be put in  twice a month  over a period of 3 months

"Technically possible, but in my (admittedly worthless) opinion it will continue to go up until the market becomes over saturated. That is until there are no more people who see utility in it. 

For example, it has a LOT of technical hurdles to overcome before it reaches mainstream adoption, in particular scalability. My argument is that gold doesn't scale either. There's a reason paper money was invented, because gold sucks. It's easy to steal,  and fake. Very difficult to divide, and transport. 

If you look at bitcoins insane transaction fees more like a digital gold than a digital cash, then it still not only provides utility better than gold (Harder to fake and harder to steal. Easy to divide, and transport), then bitcoin in it's current state is still worth 8 trillion (Gold market cap) in my (admittedly worthless) opinion. 

Then if you look at bitcoin as something that can be upgraded over time as it is simply a software protocol, then the sky is not the limit. The moon is not the limit. The universe is the limit. 

I do not see bitcoin having a ""serious"" bubble pop until it overtakes gold at the very least. By serious meaning a pop that effects the price to such an extent that they do not recover for years, as per your example of why can't it go down in 2018?

FALSE.  That is not what high volatility means.   High volatility essentially means **high standard deviation** in the average return for a given period of time.

It's possible to gain or lose,  BUT the probability of being able to book a gain in 30 days is pretty low;   If you bought $75000 worth this month and are disappointed in a ""Loss"" already,  then you're a MOMENTUM TRADER with a failed trade,  not an investor  in the technology with a view towards its long-term utility.

"I get your point, but I completely disagree. It may take a big event to unfold, and to be perfectly honest it may not even happen in our lifetimes, but I am 100% convinced we are in the biggest bubble this world has ever seen, but bitcoin isn't it. 

I'm a US citizen, and we are 20 Trillion$ in debt, and climbing. This is an unsustainable amount. All that needs to happen is enough countries going off the dollar as a world reserve currency for all those dollars to flood into the US and for hyper-inflation to occur, possibly combined with another cataclysmic event that triggers the entire thing to crumble down. 

Countries may turn to gold, but how do we know how much gold each country has and if its true what they have in reserves? Has a fort knox audit ever been made public the amount of gold the united states has? 

Bitcoin, in it's current crippled state, is more valuable than Gold in my personal non expert valuation. Once bitcoin gets upgraded in transaction speed, then adoption will increase exponentially. 

Theoretically speaking, if bitcoin survived long enough, and the US dollars decreased another 90% in value over the next 100 years like it did the last 100 years, a billion dollar bitcoin is not unreasonable and that is without any added adoption. That is purely from the dollar being devalued right from underneath the people.

"**Dark triad**

The dark triad is a subject in psychology that focuses on three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Use of the term ""dark"" implies that people possessing these traits have malevolent qualities.

Research on the dark triad is used in applied psychology, especially within the fields of law enforcement, clinical psychology and business management. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress and create severe problems for an organization, especially if they are in leadership positions (for more information, see psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism in the workplace).

"Their goal is to always increase block sizes when blocks get full. That means fees will never rise to compensate for the phase out of coinbase transactions (block rewards). Therefore, eventually, they will be worthless to mine, nobody will mine them, there will be no security, and they will be done. 

Furthermore, they are currently producing blocks faster than core, I think because of the emergency difficulty adjustment and miner games. This means they are rapidly mining rewards now, while ASICBOOST hardware still has an advantage, but they will run out of rewards faster than core. Then we reach the scenario described in the prior paragraph.

It's possible at some point bcash miners will refuse to increase block size, but then they are back to square one.

Core has the right solution. They are building LN to move small transactions off chain to make them cheaper and faster, while retaining the integrity and incentives put in place by Satoshi.

The more I learn about bcash the more I realize it is destined for failure.

Dont be stupid. Bill gates did not copy apples source code and then claim it was ""the real apple"". Bill gates built his own computer with his own design and created his own company.

The closest way for your analogy to make sense is to compare bitcoin to a alt-coin that did not use ** a single line** of bitcoins source code.

>Genuine curiosity, what causes the distain in r/Bitcoin toward BCH.

^^ your question.

>Got any arguments against Bitcoin Cash's technical merits, what I asked about?

Yes. Bcash's technical merits are complete shit. They are subsidizing their blockchain costs onto node operators without consideration for long term security. This behavior will inevitably lead towards centralization since multiple TB blockchains cannot be reasonably sustained by *cheap consumer hardware*. Stop thinking about rich americans and start thinking about the rest of the world, which is what bitcoin was made for. If people in Africa and Venezuela cannot  run nodes then that blockchain cannot stay decentralized. Considering Bcash's node count is *more than half* located on VPS nodes, its  *already* too centralized. This ignores decentralization which is the fundamental value proposition of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Also, most of the miners mining it (Bitmain/Viabtc & subsidaries) control **way more** than 51% of hashpower when you consider that these subsidaries are all controlled by a **single individual**. How secure is a blockchain who has more than 51% of its hashpower controlled by one wealthy chinese dude who's already shown capable of fucking over the network to make a few extra bucks?

It also implemented a shit algorithm that caused mayhem on the entire network, fucking over bitcoin and bcash at the same time, leading to oscillating hashpower.

Not only that, but they have a [developer centralization problem](https://twitter.com/notgrubles/status/945108885446250496) where a single developer ignores everyone else and implements shitty algorithms without reasonable peer review.

This is validated above by developers bitching about the lack of open review and fairness.

Its a centralized shitcoin with a centralized dev and centralized infrastructure.

Whats the technical merits to a centralized shitcoin pretending to be a decentralized cryptocoin?

What would bcash be without the name bitcoin? Oh yea, another bloated piece of shit altcoin with *zero purpose*.

The ***real question**, the one that **you should be asking yourself** is ""What innovation does bitcoin cash bring that other cryptocurrencies have not""?

Though I agree with most of what you said, don't you think that increasing the block size to actually make the cryptocurrency usable in the short term is necessary? Like what is the point of having BTC right now? It's so expensive to use that it isn't practical. LN kind of makes sense, but until that can actually be implemented, something needs to be done. But even then, LN seems flawed as a concept to me since it seems like a ton more computing and processing power will be necessary to create and find payment channels off chain. Sure, it will save space on the block chain, but it doesn't really seem like an ideal solution. I don't think a given cryptocurrency will succeed unless it can be used like cash: with instant transfer of ownership. Lastly, is there a reason why nodes would have to have every single block stored locally instead of like the last 500 or something?

"I don't have a number but with SW adoption **and** a 2x increase I think we'd both see a substantial stagnation in new nodes being brought on as well as old ones dropping off. It also just sets a bad precedent for easy, less sustainable solutions and will obviously lead to a damaging network split.

It's not too expensive to spam bitcoin for a bit to get very high fee levels (especially not for miners), if we started caving and forking every time this happened, not only would we destroy the network effect (by the fork likely being a minority of users/value), we'd also risk furthering miner centralization which seems to me to be one of the bigger concerns atm.

Scaling with backwards compatible protocol upgrades and second layer solutions is the only thing that makes sense at this point in my opinion. This is not to say there can never be a block size increase via hard fork, but it's obvious that a large amount of users and devs will not do it now. We have yet to even see the real benefit of our blocksize increase with SegWit, this is **not** because the users don't want it (as many try to spin it), but rather that the users aren't offered it on most of the large service providers at the moment. High switching costs and a low level of education delays this process, but IMO it is bound to reach wide adoption no matter if a few large hold-outs keep digging their heels in.

I am of the opinion that Bitcoin is extremely valuable and has the potential to change the world in major ways, however if ran by a Silicon Valley start up that is only concerned about scaling to meet user demand, it will almost certainly fail being what it could become in the long run.";3;0;False;YoungScholar89;drr6sp4;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

I don't believe that hard forks are any more likely to cause a schism than soft forks. It's just a different way of doing something similar. If the code changes are contentious then it will be still cause a divide--for exactly that reason I think hard forks are better so as to make a clean split between the divided factions. Hopefully future proposals won't cause as much of a divide as the blocksize debate has caused. I mean, hopefully there won't be any actual forks at any point, just normal scheduled updates.

"The BitcoinABC client is the most popular BCH client at the moment and it has an 8mb limit in the code, to go over that would require a hard fork unless another client which has even bigger blocks takes over the majority.

It was really easy to tell when bitcoin blocks were gonna hit the 1mb limit and for that reason the serious discussion of how to increase the block size started years in advance. I, like many others, felt a hard fork with a year lead up time would have been plenty to have minimal disruption and I think the BCH / Ethereum forks have been largely successful (not the DAO one, of course). That being said, expect many more hard forks in Bitcoin Cash for many reasons, not just block size.

"Any wallet *can* be able to send to bech32 addresses, but they need to implement support for it.

The thing is that addresses doesn't exist as far as the bitcoin network itself is concerned. Addresses are just representations for the scriptpubkey field in each transaction output. Wallets translate addresses into a scriptpubkey script when creating a transaction, so the bitcoin network itself only cares about the script.

Different address types translate into different script templates. A 1-address contains a pubkey-hash and translates into what's called a P2PKH script:

    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubkeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Segwit defines new script templates called witness programs. A P2WPKH witness program looks like this:

    OP_0 <PubkeyHash>

Since the wallet chooses template by address type, new types are required for new templates and wallets then needs to be updated to recognize the new types and use the new templates for them.

Originally, there were a proposal to just use a new type of base58-addresses (like the 1-addresses for P2PKH and 3-addresses for P2SH), but since new support has to be added either way, it was concluded that it was a good opportunity to also replace base58 with a better encoding.";11;0;False;largely_useless;drr712z;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

"> Genuine curiosity, what causes the distain in r/Bitcoin toward BCH.

BCH is an attack on bitcoin. By using the same mining algorithm and consensus breaking rules its a power grab to steal marketshare from bitcoins ecosystem.

The proponents of BCH (Roger Ver owner of bitcoin.com ...oh the irony)have perpetuated the myth that it is the ""real bitcoin"" despite the fact that this is blatantly false by every empirical measurement.

If you purchased apple stock, and then apples competitor cloned all the apples products, called it ""Apple Plus"", claimed it was ""the real apple"" and stole a % of marketshare devaluing your apple shares, then you would be pissed.

BCH is doing exactly this. This is merely an alternative form of inflation. Since they failed to reach consensus to change the rules instead they go the shady route, lie to your face and create more tokens claiming its ""the real bitcoin"". So they created another 21 million coins out of thin air, and convinced enough uneducated people that it has value.

This should never be applauded and these attacks are insidious forms of inflation that also has a brand damaging effect.

">Genuine curiosity, what causes the distain in r/Bitcoin toward BCH.  

To me, it was almost entirely because of the huge animosity that I felt the *other* way. I went to that subreddit to ask some questions, nice and politely (I know this is also what a troll or child would say, but I sincerely mean it), and got insulted by a number of posters. Then I noticed that something like 13 of 20 posts that I saw at the front of the BCH subreddit were bashing BTC rather than actually selling me on the virtues of their coin, so sold up and got out.

To me, the subreddit made it feel like a flash-in-the-pan coin, as it's community was rude to me with no provocation and seemed to be entirely based around trashing another crypto. So I got out and never looked back.

EDIT: I'm not saying in this post that I believe that the community *as a whole* is full of trolls, or that I think the coin has no technical merit, but it was just that I felt that if I was going to have my coin in something, it would be better to be in one that both felt less aggressive and also did something significantly different from BTC.

Also, my experiences are from quite some time ago. The community may be better now but I don't particularly care much any more.";20;3;False;uberduger;drr6vuu;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

"Bcash‚Äôs increased block sizes allow for more transactions in the crypto world. Ok that‚Äôs nice. However here is the nasty BUT:

With increased block sizes come the necessity for higher storage for those running the nodes. Eventually, the nodes with the money and resources are able to afford more higher storage hardware (effectively making them central servers of the network) while lesser nodes are effectively shut out of the mining fees as rewards. This creates centralization of the network... bigger players who can afford the bigger machines and infrastructures have greater control of the network. Effectively, these wealthier nodes become ‚Äúcentral banks‚Äù of the crypto world. That is the exact opposite of what cryptocurrencies are about. In true decentralized form, no single entity should be able to amass more power and influence just because your node can process more transactions. 

Furthermore, what exactly is the transaction volume limit for Bcash? With bitcoin we know what it is: 21 million bitcoins.

What‚Äôs the total circulation number for Bcash?       ?????? 

So with Bcash, we also don‚Äôt have a definite answer to the inflation question. Bcash is basically a crypto that can do all the things we want a crypto to do to compete with fiat and Visa BUT it sells its soul at the expense of true decentralization and protection against inflation.

Increasing the blocksize increases centralization. Once a system becomes too centralized i.e. a few control the system, it is very difficult to make it decentralized again. To understand the blocksize-decentralization-tradeoff, take a look at what it takes to maintain synchronized global state.  While many peers may individually be able to receive and process maybe up to 200 transactions per second (checking the signatures of each transaction (mostly because of disk seek time) takes about 5 ms), the synchronization mechanism underlying the Bitcoin Blockchain is susceptible to latency, and does only work with transaction rates much lower. If you want that many people are able to run a full node, on chain-scaling is not option. ;2;1;False;3plus1415926535897;drr5twn;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

"Trust me if you still don't dislike Roger Ver, you still haven't seen much of this dude. Used to respect him but have seen money is what he really cares about and lets it slip constantly. Anyway let's just pretend even though this coin was created to continue exploiting mining by very mischievous cats, we gotta see how the community can benefit with the coin. After all,  decentralization and your choice of cryptocurrency is what it's all about right? 

Lets just stick to technicalities and ignore everything else. More specifically, big block size. Increasing the block size simply makes the network more demanding. This is not what you are supposed to do since now you are relying our technology keeps up with these increases and not just that but this new tech has to be cheap so that it remains closer to decentralization or then you will have bitcoin cash Inc. doing all the mining and verification for all transactions on the network. 51% attack anyone? 51% attack basically means they have turned the coin into a Federal Reserve Bank. Why? Because with over 50% of hash power, that entitiy has the power to manipulate any transaction they want. If they want to refund their coins, cancel other people's transactions, or even create you own transaction and  stealing from other transactions,  it's all possible with a 51% attacks. 

Anyway why is it better to keep the network *small* and less demanding? Imagine in the future how many devices would be connected to the internet. In a few short years, our smart watches will most likely be connecting to the internet by sattleites like cell phones. What if your smartwatch was able to act as a node for bitcoin making Bitcoin's decentralization and security durasticly increased. This would be more beneficial for 3rd world countries since they most likely will struggle with the hardware side to propagate the network and remaining secure at the same time. We are already hoping more and more hardware scales so we can propagate the network on more devices and cheaper but instead bcash is working against itself by making  their network more and more demanding hoping *they* can at least validate the network. There are already a few full blocks at 8mb and soon 8mb will become the new 1mb and so on. Even the bcash technical supporter Craig Wright has said bcash should have 1 GB blocks NOW. They want to be this fast and cheap payment processor but what they and people fail to realize is this technology is already here! We can do this multiple ways!  What is the crazy part about cryptocurrency is that it is decentralized and as far as possible from any form of control. Sure BTC isn't perfect with decentralization as its still in development like every other coin but bcash is going the wrong way! They want to be visa and have stated that it's okay that one entitiy does all the confirmations. Okay you still okay with that? Okay that bcash is a centralized crypto because you get cheap and fast transaction times? That is really your decision. What isn't your decision though is how many transactions there will be in the very near future. We are going to be doing thousands upon thousands of transactions per second. And this will just be computers! Machines alone will be doing automated transactions by the thousands and as more people adopt,  we will be doing millions if not BILLIONS of transactions... per second. How big you think bcash block will have to be to even handle something like this? I would be impressed if even one giant entity had 98% hash power could handle such a feat. Bcash will add lightning just you wait. One of the biggest reasons to go bcash is because lightning ""is not what bitcoin is supposed to be"". Yet,  I guarantee you that they will want to add it. At that point why would you even need bcash if it's just copying bitcoin now? 

Bitcoin needs layers,  it all can't be done on chain. It just can't or you risk decentralization and security and that is what it's all about. And if you disagree and for some reason want a centralized bitcoin for cheap transactions now, it won't matter because eventually that block will be a Peta byte block and you will need a machine that can propagate that block in under 10 minutes,  every ten minutes.

This is what happened with Bitcoin Core, from as far back as 2013 lots of people saw  a problem coming. Namely the 1 MB artificial limit that Satoshi coded in to the application. Why did he do that? To protect the new born baby network from people taking advantage of the free transactions to spam the network as much as they want without a cost. (that's right for year miners mined transactions without a fee, even long after most clients set a minimum fee). Then block slowly filled up and as the network became big enough there was no purpose anymore for this artificial limit. 

That does not mean it should be removed completely but a small increase as needed is not a problem until bitcoin sees so much adoption that you have a team of software engineers a 1000 times the size of now working on a scaling solution. And make no mistake: a big percentage of bandwidth on the internet is porn and filesharing that people don't really pay that much extra for on top of their internet bill. It that apparently gets funded somehow bandwidth generated by Bitcoin won't become a problem until the traffic it generated takes over the traffic generated by porn. And when that happens it's also not a problem because the incentive to build data centers just to help with Bitcoin traffic will also be there. Banks already have these data centers right now and all though the costs of a centralized system are lower, these costs are being payed by the central unit. While the costs in a decentralized system are higher, these costs are being payed for by the entire network! 


So not changing the artificial blocksize when needed is the equivalent of having only 3 of your 8 cylinders working. You fix it by cleaning those spark plugs, just like you can easily change a couple of lines of code. This will not allow your car to go faster than a 200 km/h because you still have an aerodynamic problem that is much harder to fix because somewhere in the design of the car you made a mistake. And so people wanted a small increase in the blocksize, so that at least they could run at higher speeds if they wanted! 

This was blocked (haha get it) and now bitcoin core is running at 60 km/h while claiming, we can't go faster then 200 km/h anyway and neither can the other sportscars. At the same time other sportscars that can't go faster then 200 km/h drive way faster than 60km/h. How did the sportscar manufacturers respond to being passed by a slow Lamborghini, a Chinese clone of a sportscar, and a very lightweight smartcar and a dog sled? 

**""Oh in the process of fine tuning our car we discovered that what we build is not a sportscar at all but rather a tractor and that is good because lower speeds are much safer.""**

and yes if we ever need to go faster then 200 km/h we will find a design for it that allows it, just like offchain solutions are a good idea to implement ... at the right time ... with the right priorities ... when the demand asks for it but not as a surrogate for the editing of a couple of lines of code.

As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.

There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations for the Pineapple Fund, which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.

Areas include ;

1. Digital philanthropy and education as well as promote learning equality for children in low resource localities

2. Integrated Mental health care, research and society reintegration programs

3. Gender equality, Violence against women and girls(sexual and domestic), School Related Gender Based Violence and child abuse

Bitcoin will only rise so far. If it became a globally adopted currency its value would actually be insanely stable with a slight value growth every year.

"He didn't mention the Dutch... he mentioned the [Pennsylvania Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch), who are in fact German.

Remember that the word ""Dutch"" comes from ""Duits"" in its original meaning (which is of course the same as the original meaning of the German word ""Deutsch"") - being a word that simply means *people*, *nation*, or *folk*.

It's no different than the Dutch national anthem containing the lyrics ""*Wilhelmus van Nassouwe, ben ik, van Duitsen bloed*"".  He's not calling himself German, but rather identifying himself as belonging to the people of the land as opposed to being a foreigner.";3;1;False;dalebewan;drqg98l;I know who Satoshi is;7lv0o7;https://i.redd.it/zfj75psgbv501.png

"**Pennsylvania Dutch**

The Pennsylvania Dutch (Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch,  listen ) are a cultural group formed by early German-speaking immigrants to Pennsylvania and their descendants. The word ""Dutch"" does not refer to the Dutch people (Nederlanders) or their descendants, but to the German settlers, known as Deutsch (in standard German) and Deitsch (in the principal dialect they spoke, Palatine German). Most emigrated to the U.S. from Germany or Switzerland in the 17th and 18th century. Over time, the various dialects spoken by these immigrants fused into a unique dialect of German known as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania ""Dutch"".

"You will need to find a new trustless, decentralized consensus mechanism - Proof of Work is not suitable for this task. Using PoW-based consensus to enable transacting was a technique explored prior to the invention of Bitcoin, and is essentially what Adam Back's Hashcash attempted to apply to email.

Although there are several issues that this proposal leaves to the implementation to resolve, its primary and consistent failure is economic. In order for PoW to be meaningful enough to be of use, the work performed must be sufficiently _expensive_. As the consensus network matures and grows in value, the work required must become _exceedingly expensive_. This creates an economic bottleneck as it eventually becomes _too expensive_ for the users of the network to transact. The value of their funds will be out-paced by the the cost to perform transactions (sound familiar?)

Bitcoin resolved this issue in a unique way. By limiting consensus activity to those willing to invest in building the capacity to perform the exceedingly expensive work, then compensating them for their efforts using the value tokens their work proof protects, we can establish economic incentives to keep the consensus workers _honest_. Furthermore, if we limit the responsibility of the consensus workers to a task for which the output is otherwise arbitrary (establishing the fixed order of transactions), all we need of them is to honor their consensus once reached (a type of honesty). These two ideas combined opens a new possibility: we can offload the consensus gathering work and spread the cost across all transactions, lowering the total cost to the network.

Contrary to popular belief, the consensus network - represented by the miners alone - was never meant to be *greatly* decentralized as Bitcoin matured. It needs only to be *sufficiently* decentralized such that the economic incentives, the miners' self-interest, and the risk of undermining their wealth keep them from colluding in dishonoring their previously established consensus. It is important that the system be externally auditable, but it does not require that every user do so. Because of the miners restricted responsibility, their malicious actions are limited in scope to their ability to affect consensus on the order of transactions. Due to the majority-rules nature of PoW consensus, nothing can be done to directly punish a dishonest majority except to abandon their work proof as a consensus source, destroying the value of their investment in work capacity.";3;0;False;tripledogdareya;drqaku1;‚ö°Ô∏è needs you.

"Because in the long run bigger blocks won't cut it when adoption really starts to set in. Andreas did a very good video about this not too long ago. If we want to use Bitcoin for multiple daily transactions we would need bigger than 1TB blocks. Not only do these blocks need to be stored on all nodes to keep the network decentralized but the blocks jeed to be propagated throught the network every 10 minutes. This leads to the problem were many people simply won't run full nodes anymore not only due to storage problems but also bandwidth data caps from their ISPs. What you end up with is a network run by a select group of people who can still afford to run the nodes, aka a centralized network. 

Now on the other hand bigger blocks are not as evil as some people make it out to be. However the way a certain group of people who tried to force bigger block sizes with the Segwit2X fork wanted to do so without proper testing and are literally risking breaking the network. This actually happened to the Segwit2X testnet due to a miscalculation of the blocknumber activation.

TLDR; For massive adoption where people worldwide use Bitcoin as their primary payment system we need such big blocks that the network will become centralized due to only people with enough money being able to run full nodes.

Also I will try to find that Andreas video for you so you don't have to take my word for it.

"With one channel you can _in theory_ transact with anyone to whom you can find a path over a series of channel hops, with certain limitations:

* Your channel had a _funding amount_ and _balance_ which represent, respectively, the total money supply of that channel and how the funds will be split between you and your channel partner when it settles on the blockchain.
* The BTC used to fund the channel are locked for the channel's lifetime and cannot be used directly - _you no longer own them_, but you have a joint contract with your channel partner as to their eventual distribution. 
* The balance of the channel can never extend more than the total funding amount in either direction. That is to say, if you and your partner both lock 5 BTC to the channel, for a total of 10BTC, you can never send a single payment greater than 10 BTC and at most times less than that.
* At any given time, you can never send a payment greater than your current share of the channel balance, nor receive a payment greater than your partners current share of the balance. On a brand new channel with total funds of 10 BTC, split 5/5 between you and your partner, the largest possible payment you can send is 5 BTC (your current share of the balance, now 0/10 in favor of your partner), after which you can no longer send any payment until you receive payment  to restore balance in your favor). Continuing from there, let's say you're paid 8 BTC over the channel for services rendered (balance now 8/2). Shortly after, a second payment of 8 BTC is owed to you for additional services. This payment cannot reach you, the most this channel can support at the time is 2 BTC.
* Any payment in or out of the channel **must** route through your channel partner. They are free to charge you any amount they'd like for this service. You are free _not_ to pay it, but if you want to use the funds committed to the channel you would then need to pay the on-chain fee to close the channel and wait some predetermined amount of time for the funds to be available.
* In order for you to _route through_ your channel partner, they must have another established channel on the path to your destination with sufficient balance to support your payment. Each hop in the chain shares this requirement.
* Since transactions on the channel **must** route through your channel partner, they have a level of direct control over your routing options, by virtue of the fact that the *next* hop can only be a node with whom they have an established channel. Your channel partner can also influence your routing decision by offering different rates to relay to different next hops.
