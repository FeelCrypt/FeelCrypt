"> Fiat currency, the current system that is working around the world.

Yeah the system that almost imploded in 2008 and was only saved by enganing in extremely experimental and risky policies which are going to blow up again pretty soon.";1;0;False;garibaldi90;easlkbz;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png

What's the fastest way to send money from Venezuela (any other shithole country) to South Korea on a Sunday night?

"Ever since Bitcoin's inception, people like you have been constantly saying ""it's over"" with every sharp drop in price. Funny how it doesn't happen. Yes, the price was overhyped last year. And yes - the price corrected, events happened, it dropped further, but believe me, BTC is not going away, it's way too useful to become extinct.";1;1;False;curseknight;eas4m6w;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png
"So not only do you have to invent a super out of the way example for this to work, but you also ignore that this transfer costs quite a lot of money, so you'll be spending 2 bucks on a transaction of 20 bucks that arrives as 19 bucks only to be retrieved as 18, because you still can't use bitcoin. On top of that, you also have to be a dick about it.

I'd say any way other than bitcoin";1;1;False;EagleDarkX;eat604d;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png
"It isnt a super out of the way. Especially if you live in countries like Venezuela or Iran. Its hard af to take out your money.

The average transaction is currently 0.40 so yeah.

You said it literally has no use. 

> I'd say any way other than bitcoin

Sure bro whatever you say. Bitcoin uses will become obvious as we get farther along this downward cycle. Remember you wont use BTC because you want. You will be forced to ;)";1;1;False;garibaldi90;eat6o49;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png

"I don't recall putting a timescale on when it will rebound. Bear markets are often prolonged. If BTC drops below $1000 and stays there for a year then I'll concede that Bitcoin is a failed project. But for the moment, I am still quite comfortable with where it is at and I am personally not at a loss.

So come back in 2-3 years then I will re-assess the situation. If I am wrong I will happily admit to being wrong.";1;0;False;Tricky_Troll;earvcv4;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png
"A currency purely used to trade isn't a currency, it's a middle man. You might as well have your bank convert the money for you.

I don't think so, I don't live in your fantasy land, so it seems kind of unlikely.";1;1;False;EagleDarkX;eatev10;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png
It's not really a baseless claim. I can say I am convinced it will grow beyond its current all-time high at some point in the future. Why? Because I'm tired of witnessing that happening. Notice that I said I am convinced, not 100% sure. And if you asked me if I believed this would happen in up to six months from now, I would say no.;1;0;False;curseknight;eas4f1r;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png
