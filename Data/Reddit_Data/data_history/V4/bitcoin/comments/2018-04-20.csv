"> Volunteerism can't do it.

That's the con that corporations and their governments are pulling. 

The reality is that all living organisms naturally are motivated to create, explore, and share great stuff that improves life.  That's literally what evolution programs us for.

But humans have this little extra thing where we can be infected by religions and memes and belief systems and advertising and so we can be convinced to go against our natural instincts and do something that is dumb, and uncurious, and greedy, instead.  Which messes the whole system up just like any dangerous virus.

A social media forum is easy to do in a decentralized, egalitarian way.  I've been doing it for decades.  There is no silly complex fancy equipment needed beyond the normal communication tools.   I'm not sure why you would think it would.

> so rules can't be enforced by algorithm

There are no rules.  A decentralized system doesn't force rules on individuals.  The individuals make the rules themselves.  That's the whole point.  If you are participating, you are helping create the functionality of the community.  No one individual or group has control over the others.  (Which isn't totally the case with Bitcoin, which is a part of it's vulnerabilities.)

There is no such thing as an ""attack"" on a conversation community, except for the rare cases of actual spam, which is, as I said, normally easy to deal with through self-regulation, where individuals vote up or down.  Or a reporting system can help catch them, if you want to go that route.

But ultimately, it sounds like you're making excuses for not even considering it.  It works.  It's good.  Maybe you like someone else telling you what you can and can't read, and having an authoritarian government controlling your interactions with others, but that's the thing many of us who are intersted in Bitcoin find so harmful to our world.

You are not understanding the concept in its fullness. There is a difference between transparent and private. Transparent is a quality of decentralization and centralization (sometimes). Transactions should be transparent. But privacy in terms of who is making the transactions is crucial to decentralization. If an institution, corporation, government etc can decipher WHO is doing the transactions, it is not decentralized ledger.

"Volunteerism can't do it.

A main reason bitcoin works is because it's secured by fees and very expensive hardware. These two things prevent spam, abuse, Sybil attacks, etc. The fees and expensive hardware are not deal-breakers because it's a financial network in the first place, incentivized that expensive hardware, and accepts payments for fees in its own internal currency. Another reason that bitcoin works is because it polices itself with very simple (relatively) scripts - everything that happens is a transaction with meaning that is fully understood by computer. For this reason, rules are enforced entirely by algorithm.

A forum, however, is a social network, not a financial one. The idea of requiring expensive hardware and fees to use a forum will be much more resisted than those same requirements on a financial network. Additionally, the ""transactions"" are content written by humans that can't (yet) be understood by machine, so rules can't be enforced by algorithm. This means you need moderators, and without a way to prevent Sybil attacks, even random selection of users can be Sybil attacked by creating many user accounts.

I don't believe a distributed forum *that runs well at full scale* is a solved problem. You can get systems to work using volunteerism... until they have 800k users all wanting to abuse it for their own profit.

Moderation by humans is the only method currently available to prevent an 800k-strong community from devolving into a giant mess. Smaller communities will have better luck, and maybe that's honestly what is called for. A larger number of smaller communities.

"> what its limitations are, and that in fact does enforce very strong rules on individuals.

I do.  They are unimportant to the ideology.  We're talking about the general design of a system here, either centralized/top-down, or decentralized/bottom-up.

In a decentralized system the individuals do what they want, and the rules (functionality) of the system emerge naturally.  Like how your body works, with each individual cell having it's own design and approach to life, and the whole system naturally emerging as a human being (presuming you are one, which is probably likely!)  There are different genes, different expressions of those genes, in each individual, and the collective behavior is emergent humanity.

In a centralized system (also known as an artificial system) there is an attempt by one individual (or a small group) to force everyone in the system to behave in a particular way.  The individuals don't get to do what they want, and either are forced to be obedient or be kicked out (or otherwise punished).

Bitcoin is an attempt to move from the centralized national/bank currencies to a decentralized currency.

"> What is going to stop them from enforcing taxes on bitcoin that scale with USD inflation? Once that happens, doesn’t btc become useless?

Nothing and depends.

""inflation = tax"" is the dumbest argument for crypto for the reasons you pointed out. government can just increase taxes on literally anything else to compensate, so you aren't reducing the tax burden you're just shifting it to somewhere else, and its not necessarily going to be shifted to a better place than taking a tiny bit of value from everyones dollars, which has very negligible effect unless you're holding a large amount of dollars over a long period of time not invested in any kind of returns, which is not a good thing for a currency anyway.

It's not anything close to double digit percentage income, sales, and corporation taxes.

A bigger core issue is that Proof of Work is a fundamentally inefficient way of securing a network. The bigger the value of the network the more inefficient transactions have to be to stop it being more profitable to break the network than to secure it. 

People are overly focused on tokens for trade not being ""devalued"" whilst ignoring they're supporting a system that is going to waste real value (not just a token for value), by depending on an energy-computing arms race to make sure no one can have 51% of the hash power. 

If the justification of Proof of Work is to avoid ""inflation tax"" then its utterly doomed to fail because you're not avoiding tax you're just switching to a form of money that now wastes huge amounts of resources to stop anyone from compromising it.

You may be right. I don't know. Some of the other objections raised here also have merit. My point is merely that governments are not going to allow untaxed transactions for long. They have the power to enforce at least some regulation, and they will exercise that power. Why try to resist that? And indeed, if we want to live in a civilized world, then taxes are price of admission.

Second. It’s true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it’s false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity. Is Coinbase trustworthy?  What software do YOU use to convert your bitcoin ?  Why has so much bitcoin (hundreds of millions) been stolen if Decentralization builds so much trust?

*next*. Auditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed — that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars.

And to Keep your Overseas Aid records in a tamper-proof
repository not owned by ""anyone” sounds right — yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his aid has been recieved? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party — like the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the aid or providing the software?

Blockchain systems are supposed to be more trustworthy, but in fact they are the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade, three successive top bitcoin exchanges
have been hacked, another is accused of insider trading, crypto price swings are ten times those of the world’s most mismanaged currencies,and bitcoin, the “killer app” of crypto transparency, is almost certainly artificially propped up by fake transactions involving billions of literally imaginary dollars.";1;1;False;DeathbyOstrich;dxnx2ez;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

"**Gender binary**

The gender binary, also referred to as gender binarism (sometimes shortened to just binarism), is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine. Gender binary is one general type of a gender system. Sometimes in this binary model, ""sex"", ""gender"" and ""sexuality"" are assumed by default to align. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a heterosexual attraction to females.

It is not possible for coins to appear in address B for instance, without having been sent there from some other address.

It is not possible to obfuscate away your identity just by creating lots of new addresses within the nano, because it is easy to read this part of the blockchain as a closed system whose total adds up to 100 (assuming 100 coins first entered the system from the exchange), and a simple algorithm could trace the origin back to the exchange pretty quickly.";2;1;False;hextree;dxoa5ob;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

Not true. There is a difference between transparent and private. Transparent is a quality of both centralization and decentralization. Transactions should be transparent to all. But privacy in terms of WHO is making the transactions is crucial to decentralization. If an institution, corporation, government etc can decipher WHO is doing the transactions, it is not decentralized ledger. It is just a database. Anyone can track transactions, central or decentral. No one should be able to track specific people making the transactions, eliminating privacy.;1;0;False;fakelarrybird;dxofng3;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

"The integrity you’re questioning is the medium we use to access blockchain technology; not the blockchain technology itself. 

Auditing is difficult in its current format but every transaction is recorded; it’s immutable and absolutely traceable. It is far more audit-friendly than the cash in your pocket, because once you’ve identified one person’s purchase on the blockchain, you can trace everything they have done on it, and know that it is unquestionably accurate.

Regarding your afghan villager analogy; you’re again questioning the medium people use to access blockchain technology. The interface people use is (as you rightly suggest), one of the biggest challenges cryptocurrencies are facing for adoption. Similarly to your example, did you know that 80% of Kenya’s GDP is made of a digitalised currency? [see here](https://www.kachwanya.com/2017/07/26/ten-years-line-80-kenyan-gdp-pass-mpesa/) 

People are literally trading mobile data and call minutes for food and water. Now, imagine the potential in western countries where technology is so widespread.

The weaknesses of blockchain technology are not weaknesses of blockchain technology at all, but are borne from how young the technology is. I think your arguments are almost certainly applicable to cryptocurrencies, and it’s interfaces. Look at the internet; still marred by problems today. Decades since its inception most would argue it contains the cesspit of humanity, and yet still the greatest invention of the last century.

"The blockchain is trustless, not the exchanges. The exchanges are a speculation machine, not part of the tech. Not to say that trustless decentralized exchanges couldn't exist, but that is another topic.

Talking of stolen bitcoin in exchanges is like talking (about the security of the banks and) of your neighbour coming in your home and stealing you cash. It's irrelevant, it says nothing about the blockchain.

The only valid way to buy and exchange bitcoin is peer to peer, any other is not part of the tech as it goes out of the blockchain into the servers of a 3rd party. Thing is there *is* a way, if you use it or not is all on you.

The software is open source and easy to set up in a toy/test configuration to check it for yourself. There is nothing in it that cannot be scrutinised and doesn't really belong to anyone. Its development is bounded by game theoretic forces (it has to develop in a manner that is self sustainable , i.e. in a way that all 3 major groups of interest of the bitcoin network are being satisfied, devs-miners-users, as one feeds the other in a non trivial way)

BTW you never need to trust a 3rd party to exchange your coins. I use bitcoin to buy things (every now and then) and do it directly via exchanging bitcoin from my wallet to the vendor's and then attaching the transaction ID to a message that I send to the vendor

It's about storage and transaction of data/wealth in a manner that is foulproof. That has never done before and to the extend that is truly foulproof it's probably one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century. Esepcially if it starts taking over all processes that until now required a centralized database. Imagine how much wealth would be unlocked merely by the act that neither the data's storage nor its transaction can be tampered with. The value of such a proposition is immense, at least several trillions in today's valuations, hence the rife speculation.

Of course it can all go to zero if a reliable and relatively cheap way is found to tamper with it (for example there is the 51%, but no cheap way exists to initiate it , currently, giving dicincentive to a potential attacker, if anything you can actually make it even harder to the attacker, as the network grows)";1;1;False;Steven81;dxock0f;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

">  It's irrelevant, it says nothing about the blockchain.

Except they are needed for blockchain. And when they are hacked, it hurts everyone who owns Bitcoin. Unlike when a bank is is robbed it only hurts the bank, not my account.

So you have to trust that other persons software.

This is definitely true. And there are some faucets I've come across that are definite scams. Most of them do things like make the minimum for withdrawal a number that is just above what the site will allow you to generate so you never actually get the earnings off the site into your own private wallet. And I don't doubt that some of them use your processor for mining in the background.

"No, its not.


Its 98% manipulated right now. Look at the chart; from april 1st the big players started buying and selling in big chunks. Almost on cue every day since. Big chunk of BTC bought -> accumulate a few hours -> dump. Rinse and repeat. Everything in between the dumps are bot trading against each other. 


Massive candles like this cant and wont last. We will retrace to 6400 and possibly a lot lower very soon. Of course, I want to see BTC rise and make money like crazy. But this kind of fast and controlled spikes are not the indication of a new bull market at this point.
