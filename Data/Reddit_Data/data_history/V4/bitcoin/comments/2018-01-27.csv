I'd have to say that anyone who has vaulted at all probably had some of those things happen.  I also hit the standards,  flung backwards, missed the mat. I did try to catch a pole once for another vaulter but he bailed and hung onto the pole...it went to fling him backwards and was loaded a bit and he let go. Damn pole hit me right in the forehead... Blood everywhere. Took a few stitches but was good to go otherwise. Also tore my ACL another time.

"Hello /r/all and welcome to /r/bitcoin.

Please review the sidebar for our community guidelines and [more information about Bitcoin.](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html)

[For those out of the loop and wondering what ""SegWit"" is...](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)

Traders are still trading just as much. The network was congested because of the number of new users. Coinbase accounted for 58% of all transactions at some point. A series of frightening news scared the weaker hands away and reduced the influx of new users to a degree. I'm fairly confident that a new mania will happen at some point this year and fees will start to increase again, but by then the network should be able to deal with it without reaching a breaking point like it did a few times in 2017 when the mempool was overflowing. We could probably weather a new mania as long as all wallet apps and exchanges offer SegWit by default and as long as Coinbase batches its transactions.;5;1;False;Exotemporal;dtbw9g2;Bitcointalk's famous user Loaded moved his 40k BTC stash to a native SegWit address. $1 in fee to move $400M+.;7tcmi4;https://twitter.com/khannib/status/957186970672947200

"Oh god, you really got burnt. I‘m sorry for you. That really was a bad fee situation back then, and the horrendous fees coinbase asks for weren‘t exactly helping.

The problem is, blockchain transaction fees are never per value, but per complexity of the transaction. So, had you moved one million dollars, your fees would have been exactly the same - and negligible. Of course they weren‘t for you, and that‘s shitty.

No blockchain will ever be able to scale, because you basically can only make blocks bigger in a linear fashion - blocks of double the size can handle double the transactions, and it‘s questionable if that actually equals to double the users.

That‘s where technologies like lightning come into play, which scale on a whole different way, and can scale per user. Whereas a blockchain gets worse with more users, lightnind and other peer 2 peer networks get *better*. And believe me, all other cryptos with blockchain either have low fees because they aren‘t actually used, bitcoin **is**, or they use blocks so stupidly big it‘s impossible to keep the coin decentralized, which is one of the core values if bitcoin - being decentralized, trustless, and under no ones control.

"Fees dropped a lot.

He paid $1 for this transaction and that was expensive. A typical transaction is cheaper than $1 now.

Transactions were expensive recently for a few reasons. The network was congested by a massive influx of new users and because Coinbase makes a huge amount of inefficient transactions, wasting millions in transaction fees. Coinbase pledged that they would start batching their transactions, which will significantly relieve the pressure on the network. What's more, SegWit adoption is increasing, so more transactions are recorded in each block, further lowering the pressure on the network.

The person this thread is about moved his bitcoins from a normal address to a SegWit address. A SegWit address starts with a ""3"" instead of a ""1"".

"I don't know the answers to that, this was about a month ago, i wanted to get into crypto and of course Bitcoin was the thing i had heard about, so i bought like $70 in BTC from Coinbase, and sent it to my new wallet (i don't know why i would want to do that, but whatever).

The transaction took about 4 hours and they charged me $34. I thought ""what's this shit, i'm gonna sell all my BTC and buy another coin with lower fees"", because i wanted to trade, etc.

But when i tried to send my BTC back to my Coinbase wallet, a message told me i had insufficient funds because the fees were about 85% of the quantity i wanted to move. 

So i left my BTC there and bought some more coins, this time ETH, and waited so the fees became lower.

">The fact that it is not inflationary is something that everyone needs

The entire world abandoning deflationary currencies like gold coins says otherwise.

And it wasn't because of frangibility. Pure gold is terrible for coins because its too soft. Almost all gold coins in history have been alloyed with silver or copper or other metals to make them harder. You can make a 1 cent gold coin the size of a pizza if you wanted.

People don't use deflationary currency like gold for exactly the same reason they don't use deflationary currencies like bitcoin. If it keeps going up in value then people will hoard it and use things that don't keep going up in value as a currency instead. It causes a deflationary spiral that eventually leads to the abandonment of a currency. Gold was only mildly deflationary so it took a long time to be abandoned. Bitcoin is hyper-deflationary, so the transition from currency to speculative asset has been much more rapid.

A counterfeit payment to someone like that is devastating, whereas to me, I'd just throw it away and get over it.

"that's just untrue. I live somewhere where average daily wage is $5. They save using cash under the pillow or gold on their necks. Gold is useful because if there is an emergency they can take it to a pawnshop and get a loan based on the value of the gold, but this eats away at their savings as rates are predatory, and they usually cannot get the money together to pay back the loan.  
In Africa, one of the main things many save for is a bicycle. Bikes open up oppurtunities but on a daily wage of $2, they save for a long time to be able to pay the $20-25 for a 2nd hand refurbed bike. They cannot get loans because they have no proof of a consistent $2 per day, since traditional banking is inpractical for that. With a crypto-banking statement, they can show proof of earnings, and maybe get a  loan to pay for the bicycle, accelerating their business and improving their lives.  
     
So basically no matter how little they make, there is a need for saving money. There may be a desire for loans. Micro-banking is a perfect fit for crypto-currency, they could even do it without a mobile device using internet shops or 3rd party services built on top of existing facilities like you get a mobile top-up

"**M-Pesa**

M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India and in 2014 to Romania and in 2015 to Albania. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa) easily with a mobile device.

The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money.

"It's a big deal, although SegWit alone wouldn't guarantee low fees if a sizable percentage of the population wanted to use bitcoin for their daily shopping. That's what the Lightning Network is for.

The block size limit is at 1 MB currently. Thanks to SegWit, we've had blocks that exceeded 2 MB recently. It can more than double the number of transactions that can be processed every 10 minutes.

Adoption should keep increasing steadily. People who can choose between a normal transaction and a SegWit transaction will opt for the cheaper transaction all other things being equal.

It's irrelevant now because there's virtually no backlog. Many of those 50K transactions have a deliberately low fee because the people who made are ok with waiting. As long as the transaction is going through in the next block for a fraction of a dollar, you're golden. People who pay $5.5 and up are wasting money, probably because the service they're using is forcing or encouraging them to pay a needlessly high fee.

Yep, people think money they give to a bank is there's. It isn't anymore.

"KYC / AML regulations exist for a reason. They're an important part of a well functioning society. You can get by without them for a while, but slowly, as you grow and scale an economy, you pay the cost of not having them. Widespread corruption is nearly inevitable without proper KYC AML regulations in the long run. There is a reason why fast growing economies like China and India have recently enacted stricter controls on money. 

Traditionally the relevant question comes down to where the balance of the cost of this type of regulation breaks even with the cost of not having it, which dictates how strict a particular country's kyc aml regulations are. The smaller the economy, the less strict, the larger, the more strict. 

Where blockchain tech comes in is it can either circumvent the regulation, or it can make the cost of this regulation much cheaper. Research and history have shown that the former is probably a very bad outcome, and major governments will likely not allow this to happen at a large scale. The latter requires that government gets it's hand into the system, likely directly regulating or even directly controlling. 

Take your pick. ";10;5;False;ledeuxmagots;dtbtzw8;Bitcointalk's famous user Loaded moved his 40k BTC stash to a native SegWit address. $1 in fee to move $400M+.;7tcmi4;https://twitter.com/khannib/status/957186970672947200

"Please don't take what I am about to say as trolling, I appreciate and root for crypto and have for years, but I guess I don't understand the community and exactly what you all want in terms of crypto and how it is regulated, or not regulated.

For example, this sub is filled with posts about 5 and 6 figure transactions that take months to show up with zero accountability from the receiving exchange, or even a response. There is wide spread evidence of price manipulation and fraud. Finally, the security at some of these exchanges is clearly inadequate, as 100s of millions of dollars have now been stolen and there is zero recourse for the people who have lost everything.

Contrast that with your complaint that it took a couple of phone calls and 30 minutes to get your money while they made sure both you and your family member weren't getting scammed. That just doesn't seem like a big deal to me compared to everything mentioned above.

So what am I missing? Is crypto supposed to be a truly unregulated wild west type of environment, and it is up to the individual to make sure they aren't defrauded. Or should there be accountability and processes in place to protect the  individual.

"Serious question - do you think the bank wants to spend all that time and energy verifying your piddly $12k transaction? Absolutely not.

Bank executives are as frustrated as you are that the government has effectively forced financial institutions to become the investigative and enforcement agents of anti money laundering. It’s an enormous cost in both absolute dollars and in brand value. The fines for ignoring the procedures, however, are astronomical. 

Similarly, do you actually think banks, which are profit seeking institutions, have any problem with the marijuana industry? Absolutely not. They would love to bank this burgeoning industry but FinSEN and local state regulators make that impossible. 

Your problem isn’t with the bank, it’s with regulations that make an already challenging business much more frustrating. My worry is what a new regulatory layer on blockchain would look like.

"bitcoinfees.earn.com has useful information (all the transactions breakdown) but its recommendations are horrible. They recommend whatever fee will get your transaction in the next block, when most of the times you would prefer paying a tenth or even less and wait a couple of hours. You should look at what fee level the number of pending transactions is thinning out versus the number of confirmed transactions and set the fee yourself.
This website is actually doing more harm than good with its recommendations because by recommending high fees it pushes up fees for everyone. Even right now that transactions under 10 satoshi/byte get confirmed quickly, people enter new transactions with fees higher than 200 satoshi/byte!

Part of the money was from a Wells Fargo loan that a family member had transferred from their account to mine. The manager felt it was necessary to verify with the other branch that they knew who the other person was. Do they think I am some super hacker that penetrated the banks internal systems?

This is after I had called them that morning to verify they had the cash on hand and driven an hour and a half to get the money because I moved to an area without a branch. I had enquired at another local bank about opening an account and transferring the money but they said there would be a 5-7 day hold on the money for new account holders.

Cool story bro.;1;1;False;kwanijml;dtav7y5;New Years Party;7ngg97;https://i.redd.it/ren31e10wh701.jpg
"> If anything, bitcoin has shown to be countercyclical, like gold, and would likely boom during a recession, as people run to park their money in deflationary assets.

If during the next crash, people flee to BITCOIN of all things, I'll be a believer.

The reason gold is a store of value is because it's got thousands of years of history as a valued and sought after commodity. For most of human history, and across the globe, people have collected and treasured gold.

Bitcoin is just about the furthest thing from Gold you could possibly describe. The idea that if there was a major economic downturn, people would flock to bitcoin for stability is... wild.
