"I've been reading that mailing list again, I've just arrived at the announcement of Bitcoin v0.1, and I hadn't noticed before how Satoshi mentions ""You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. "" I like how it was just an option to generate coins when the difficulty was so low.

I also like Hal Finney's (RIP) thought experiment:

""As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.""

And then Satoshi's reply:

""I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite. """;1;0;False;antifactual;e8tqow9;10 years ago today...

How is that at all relevant to our discussion?

The advantage of peer to peer lending is that loan seekers can get better rates than they would from banks.  Also, investors can better rates by loaning to other people than to loan to banks.  Cutting banks out of the process helps both parties.

In this world there are usually 2 reasons for everything: the one that sounds good and the actual reason.  It certainly sounds good to say the government is there to protect people.  In reality what they have done is make it illegal for non accredited investors (i.e. not millionaires) to participate in vast majority of the primary market.  Does that protect me? No.  Does that protect rich people's ability to encourage people starting a business to take ridiculous equity deals for financing?  Yes.
