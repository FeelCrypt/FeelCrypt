"Enough that it's worth selling, and thus I've found out how inconvenient it is to turn it into USD. The fact that it is hard to spend saved me from cashing half of it out back when it was in the $2,000 to $2,500 range.

By the time I got my act together and started doing something with it, the price had gone well past $3,000. I still have about 80% of what I mined. I'm still spending what I can directly and looking to turn small chunks to USD as I go. Every transaction ends up being smaller than the one before (smaller in BTC for the same amount of USD I pull out).

Hopefully it keeps going up. I'll hold a bit in reserve in case it just never stops going up in value. No idea what would make me sell the reserve portion. I suppose if the reserve got too high in value I'd reduce the amount of BTC in the reserve in that same way (smaller chunks of BTC to get a fixed size chunk of USD).";1;0;False;dhanson865;dqqcqkk;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"I want to share my story over how I became a Master crypto trader I first heard about Bitcoin a couple years ago from a twitter account called Trutherbot. This twitter account played a big role in waking me to the truths of the federal reserve and the worldwide central banking scam. Nevertheless everytime he would post something about bitcoin I was to lazy to actually watch a 10 minute video on what it was. Fast forward to summer 2017 Im working and going to school at the same time hating both at the same time. While I learned some valuable lessons and hd great teachers in college I saw Most universities as outdated institutions more focused on making money and having a succesful football team that actually keeping up to date with the age of information where most careers will have to be relearned by the time you get that paper. To top it all off I would have to go into debt to pay a 4 year university tuition.  My job on the other hand was HUGE on ""SELL THIS SELL THAT SELL EVERYTHING"" It always made me feel like a total cuck seeing poor ladies with their fast food uniform on count out cash to try and pay their bills and it be my job to try to sell them on something I knew they couldn't afford. Point being I felt like a total shill working there and I wanted out. By habit I fall sleep watching a documentary about anything I find on youtube.  I watched a youtuber who  mentioned Bitcoin which was what eventually made me say "" What the hell is this bitcoin thing"" and decided to do some research. It was love at first sight. I saw Bitcoin as a sword forged from liberty itself to cut off the tentacles of historical bank oppression and create a financial revolution #DecentralizeEverything. I was so ecstatic; I felt like I had discovered a digital California gold rush besides the technological and financial revolution I was witnessing. I became huge on Bitcoin, almost all my twitter and facebook posts were about cryptocurrency and I kept telling everyone how this was the future. In those summer months I would get out what I could of my paycheck and put it into bitcoin. As the boom continued I continued to HODL and make more money. Then it hit me. ""people who dedicate their life to trading stocks or forex it isnt luck its a strategy, and any strategy can be learned and applied. As I hodled I called my family back in Mexico and told them all about it and my mom sent me 1k to invest it for her. The more I grew in knowledge the more comfortable I felt trading. Over time due to my posts on social media more and more people kept messaging me asking me about bitcoin and how they could invest. This made me decide to start a hedge fund and run it month by month. This was it. My exit from being a tax slave to the dollar fictional system. I quit my job, dropped out of school sold my car and moved back to Mexico with my fam so I could focus full time to trading with maximum efficiency. Fast forward to November 2017. I have 12.5 k invested and my sister turns 15, Her Dad sends her 6k as a birthday present and my mom gives me 4k to invest it for her. Total 16.5 k for the month. One night, I see BCH is pumping like hell. Sticking to trader discipline I tell myself theres no way IM buying on such a high, It goes from 300 to 400 to 500 to 600 to 1lk bam bam bam. This at the same time BTC is going down. I scamble to social media and see everyone talking about ""The Cashening"". I told myself I wouldent switch unless it went over 2.5k. Within 15 minutes I saw my fund drop 50% in price and i dumped. Now sitting with 50% of what I had I knew I had to make a powerplay to end the month positive. I scoured altcoins for that answer and found XLM. I even posted an analyses on my tradingview. telling everyone to buy at 491 and predicted a 57-120% increase . 4 hours before The pump I set a stop loss on XLM and go to sleep just in case. I wake up to find myself stop lossed with no XLM and it being around 1k sats. again , devastation. I wasent about to end the month negative and dissapoint all my Friends and family. I learned how to margin trade. I made an account on Bitmex and transfered my remaining funds in there. Fast forward to today. I see BTC forming a pennant after breaking resistance and decide to all in 25x leverage. Gone, everything is gone. I apologize for the rushed ending but im still in shock. Im sorry for the clickbait title but I want this story to serve as an example to anyone who wants to become a ""trader""  in crypto. My advice is never go all in and just hodl; dont trade. or you could end up like me. A fool who let greed blind him. I dont want anyone else to experience the stress and anguish I felt and still feel. This all happened not more than 2 hours ago. Please be careful.";1;1;False;crashmarcoz;dqqhiy3;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

I hate politicians and bureaucrats because they hate us and they take advantage of us. They go on television an insult us and then they are laughing behind our back’s. Our income taxes nothing but a leverage of power. Those with clout and favor can buy their way through the system. Elections can be bought. Have you ever asked yourself where the hell these politicians come from? Who picks these people to run. I don’t mean who we vote for, I mean the choices we have to pick from. I’ll look at it from their point of view, I get to spend other people’s money and you get to pay for it. It’s amazing how some people hold these douche bags up as people of the people. Barf! All they do is redistribute wealth in a way that will benefit them next election. I’m sick of it and I believe most Americans will agree. Income tax is disgusting and it’s wrong morally. Stealing someone’s income before they even see it themselves and I making them beg for it back at the end of the year. Like I said, I’m all for paying taxes on consumption. The power to tax is the power to control, and ultimately it will be our fate if it continues to grow. I mean the IRS. You should look up the iron triangle. Reagan spoke about it and you will see that They have built a power structure that cannot be broken. That is why I am so for block chain technology.

Do you honestly think that we should borrow $500 billion a year? Every time they do, money is printed and value is decreased. It’s an extra tax if you will. Inflation. We all know what was meant by that, that gives Congress the power to borrow when absolutely necessary. Such as in time of war. The original articles said the exact opposite of this. They did not want our Country in debt. They did not want the federal reserve. They have bastardized our constitution since its beginning. This goes back to the “general welfare” clause. They have use that as an excuse to regulate and monitor everything. Just like the fourth amendment. Today they argue that Internet was not included in the fourth amendment. Do you really buy that horse shit? They don’t mind trashing the second amendment. What about our First Amendment, which includes our freedom of speech. In this case, money is speech. I vote with my dollar every time I use it. Some people just won’t understand, they just except the status quo. They don’t do their research and understand the founding principles of the United States. We were not meant to have a $4 trillion overlord. We were definitely not meant to have the government spending so much more than they take in promising that we will pay it back. That is not even the real number, the real number is $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Look it up. They never talk about this. This is money that they have promised today to pay people tomorrow. Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, etc. Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the world. If that was not the case, then how did people get benefits to it right away. I mean as soon as it was past, people started receiving money. There’s no lockbox. Your money is not sitting somewhere waiting for you.

Well, I'd one day like to live in a world where crypto trading is the norm. I have a gtx1060 that is mining like a dollar a day, basically investing a portion of my electricity into bitcoin. I started when bitcoin was around 4,000. I didn't have any plans of investing. I just wanted to be able to trade with the perks of a block chain technology. All of a sudden it's at 11,000 and I doubled my money, which was only like 20 or 30 dollars worth of btc at the time. If the value balloons, then I can afford more stuff. But if I have 100 million dollars worth of btc and the world is stuck on fiat, I'd trade it to fiat. Either way, it's not a large investment on my part, so at the worst I only wasted a few dollars of electricity. I'm excited to see what happens! ;1;0;False;;dqqeixj;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

With the exception of certain BTC forks, Bitcoin or a form of government backed crypto currencies will be used as a monetary policy to devalue specific fiat currencies at some unknown time in the future.

" I first heard about Bitcoin a couple years ago from a twitter account called Trutherbot. This twitter account played a big role in waking me to the truths of the federal reserve and the worldwide central banking scam. Nevertheless everytime he would post something about bitcoin I was to lazy to actually watch a 10 minute video on what it was. Fast forward to summer 2017 Im working and going to school at the same time hating both at the same time. While I learned some valuable lessons and hd great teachers in college I saw Most universities as outdated institutions more focused on making money and having a succesful football team that actually keeping up to date with the age of information where most careers will have to be relearned by the time you get that paper. To top it all off I would have to go into debt to pay a 4 year university tuition.  My job on the other hand was HUGE on ""SELL THIS SELL THAT SELL EVERYTHING"" It always made me feel like a total cuck seeing poor ladies with their fast food uniform on count out cash to try and pay their bills and it be my job to try to sell them on something I knew they couldn't afford. Point being I felt like a total shill working there and I wanted out. By habit I fall sleep watching a documentary about anything I find on youtube.  I watched a youtuber who  mentioned Bitcoin which was what eventually made me say "" What the hell is this bitcoin thing"" and decided to do some research. It was love at first sight. I saw Bitcoin as a sword forged from liberty itself to cut off the tentacles of historical bank oppression and create a financial revolution #DecentralizeEverything. I was so ecstatic; I felt like I had discovered a digital California gold rush besides the technological and financial revolution I was witnessing. I became huge on Bitcoin, almost all my twitter and facebook posts were about cryptocurrency and I kept telling everyone how this was the future. In those summer months I would get out what I could of my paycheck and put it into bitcoin. As the boom continued I continued to HODL and make more money. Then it hit me. ""people who dedicate their life to trading stocks or forex it isnt luck its a strategy, and any strategy can be learned and applied. As I hodled I called my family back in Mexico and told them all about it and my mom sent me 1k to invest it for her. The more I grew in knowledge the more comfortable I felt trading. Over time due to my posts on social media more and more people kept messaging me asking me about bitcoin and how they could invest. This made me decide to start a hedge fund and run it month by month. This was it. My exit from being a tax slave to the dollar fictional system. I quit my job, dropped out of school sold my car and moved back to Mexico with my fam so I could focus full time to trading with maximum efficiency. Fast forward to November 2017. I have 12.5 k invested and my sister turns 15, Her Dad sends her 6k as a birthday present and my mom gives me 4k to invest it for her. Total 16.5 k for the month. One night, I see BCH is pumping like hell. Sticking to trader discipline I tell myself theres no way IM buying on such a high, It goes from 300 to 400 to 500 to 600 to 1lk bam bam bam. This at the same time BTC is going down. I scamble to social media and see everyone talking about ""The Cashening"". I told myself I wouldent switch unless it went over 2.5k. Within 15 minutes I saw my fund drop 50% in price and i dumped. Now sitting with 50% of what I had I knew I had to make a powerplay to end the month positive. I scoured altcoins for that answer and found XLM. I even posted an analyses on my tradingview. telling everyone to buy at 491 and predicted a 57-120% increase . 4 hours before The pump I set a stop loss on XLM and go to sleep just in case. I wake up to find myself stop lossed with no XLM and it being around 1k sats. again , devastation. I wasent about to end the month negative and dissapoint all my Friends and family. I learned how to margin trade. I made an account on Bitmex and transfered my remaining funds in there. Fast forward to today. I see BTC forming a pennant after breaking resistance and decide to all in 25x leverage. Gone, everything is gone. I apologize for the rushed ending but im still in shock. Im sorry for the clickbait title but I want this story to serve as an example to anyone who wants to become a ""trader""  in crypto. My advice is never go all in and just hodl; dont trade. or you could end up like me. A fool who let greed blind him. I dont want anyone else to experience the stress and anguish I felt and still feel. This all happened not more than 2 hours ago.

"exactly this. Bitcoin is a store of value, and because it is deflationary there no chance of it losing value to an outside source creating more. It is the inverse of toilet paper. 

There may be a better system that comes along. Look at it like the early adoption of the internet. At first very few were using it or understood how, it was troublesome and clanky, slow and had to be used at home. Now you can look up random crap or order a pizza while sitting at a red light and streaming music from a device that fits in the palm of your hand. Bitcoin can adapt. It's digital and can evolve, or should those who develop it choose not to evolve, it will be left behind for better tech that meets the needs of the future.

Personally, if bitcoins went up to $450,000 in two years I wouldn't be jealous or anything. I mean I know people that own it and I told them to sell when it got over $10,000 and some listened some didn't. So if it goes up to a billion dollars more power to them and to you.

"That's a very good point. But the major difference between software and bitcoins is that software creates a viable object with many applications and purposes. Some software is incredibly valuable, some are not. With bitcoins, those letters and numbers do not spit out anything. It is solely for the identification of shady money. The only thing you can create out of it is greed, panic and enough of it in the right hands pure chaos. Like you're seeing now. 

Seriously, one of the more prominant leaders of bitcoins is a lunatic. And not in a OCD savant kind of way. If the general manager or whatever of where you work told you he would dance in front of the entire staff naked and allow you pluck pieces of hair out of his head if production went up 500% in the next year would you take a company like that seriously?

Exactly. Regular money is just that, paper and metal. Venezuela money isn't worth shit because their government is shit and currupt as hell. You need to find the right type of regular money just like with any form of legal tender. Now I understand that people in poor countries are buying bitcoins as a means to hedge against whatever money their country runs on but why bitcoins? Because having physical American money around could be a death sentence. Because they don't trust the internet and won't set up an account with a US based bank because of all the stories they have heard about hacking and so forth. What these people fail to see is buy buying bitcoins, they're actually doing what they fear. Except bitcoins comes with a clause. Just trust us scumbags running things okie? Bitcoins are a setup. Many will probably be hurt in the next couple of years. A select few, the ones selling and selling, yeah they'll be fine. But people don't want to hear this. Why do you think only like 12 people or something own 50% of everything? They didn't get that way by being ethical and looking out for the masses. They did it the bitcoin way.

So it moved up 10% that day. What do you do? Do you sell and cash out your $50 profit or do you hold onto it, not because you wouldn't mind a quick $50. God knows if you could just give someone $500 and the end of the day he says, here I'll give you $50 plus your $500 back. You'd go bragging to your friends how fucking smart you are.

">Central banks dictate interest rates according to monetary policy.

What’s your point? This is the mother of all market manipulations.

>buy govt bonds to fund the government.

You mean handing out billions to fiscally irresponsible and financially unsustainable governments such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and to some extend France against ridiculously low interest rates.

In the mean time, pensions take huge hits because they cannot make the required 8% yields due to the rigged interest rates.

New housing bubbles have formed in Asia, especially Hong Kong and China due to artificially low interest rates. 

This ofcourse won’t end well. As soon as interest rates go up, bubbles start to pop. So the world is trapped in a dangerous, bubble inflating low interest rates situation. At some point rates must go up. It might well be flight into Bitcoin that causes this in a year or five. It won’t be pretty.

You just edited your comment extensively so I’ll reply to the additional part. I don’t support war, yet this comment demonstrates how shallow and misplaced your anger is. My country doesn’t always act directly on behalf of the will of its people, there is a ton of opposition. I’m sure your country has done things you aren’t proud of and will continue to do things you do not fully support. Our leader wasn’t even elected in on a majority. I bet we have about as much say in each others governments as we do in where we’re born. Well, slightly more, I vote and express my opinion. If I think that North Korea does a lot of fucked up things I don’t immediately assume insane things like “none of them get sarcasm” or “they are all terrible people”.

"Satoshi felt that by printing money they were robbing money from responsible folks who had saved up money instead of punishing banks that had irresponsible leveraged and made insane bets on real estate.  Because all the money printed devalued currencies he wanted to create a currency that couldn't be manipulated like that.

As for whether this is good or bad, well I think the viewpoint of folks who support non inflationary money their point is that the debt driven bubbles you see in debt based economies are harmful.  That you get short term economic booms but then the house of cards will come crashing down every now and then and devastate people.  So they basically feel that a slow and steady sort of growth based on savings and only spending when we need to is the right path.  Whether this is true or not is a matter of debate and also a sort of philosophical issue.

That's why you'll see bitcoiners rant against ideas like fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing, etc.

I think that objectively these tools have the ability to affect the economy but they become very addictive, and you can end up in a crazy debt sinkhole over time without good solutions.

"Inflationary fiat is manipulated by debt of commercial banks.  Using a currency that can't be assigned a fee for lending which is greater than its inflationary value creates a competitive environment against banks, except their competition is a ghost person. It's just a tool.  A tool superior to theirs because it doesn't thirst for wealth, it simply operates.  Bankers are not just other players in the game.  They are more like the Dungeon Masters in a Dungeons & Dragons game.  They can create arbitrary rules to make the journey easy or hard, and like many DMs, they often fall to some ridiculous hubris and ruin their game for everyone.  With crypto, people have, not in all cases but in many of the banks' primary functions, the opportunity to not play the game they've been forced to play against their consent by existing in a country with a central bank.

Put it another way.  Imagine a bank had to actually take a risk with every investment.  They don't actually have to do that if they operate in a country where they can create a loan in the currency they operate in so long as that currency is technically infinite.  There's no risk if the money you lend is imaginary.  You're not giving anything away.  It's just paperwork that others agree has value.  There isn't even actual legal tender being exchanged.

With deflationary assets, that is, finite crypto currency, banks have no ability to create that money.  They actually have to lend you legitimate principal and trust that you will pay it back otherwise they are fucked.  Laws meant to recoup money aside, that is not something banks actually have to do in the modern age and is something I don't think people even understand.  This is precisely why gold was removed from the American banking system - it is a show of trust that, while I can't speak for them, I'll assume they felt had no real advantage over the advantage of being able to print money that could be lent out for higher than inflation's cost.  When you hide that fake money agreement document behind a central bank that holds real life money tender to give to your bank just in case everyone freaks out and asks for their money back at the same time, it then takes A LOT of people asking for their money for the truth to be revealed about how little money the banks actually have, but when they do the bank is not just fucked by that one deal that was faked, every fake deal on their books at the time explodes.  Cooked books is an infinite understatement when it comes to bank accounting and fiat in the last 40 years.

If you are educated about the sub-prime mortgage loan created crisis 10 years ago, I want you to imagine a world where it could ever exist within a cryptocurrency based market.  Imagine a world where a bank is so confident in people that literally can be measured based on their paychecks to have no ability to pay off their loans being given a loan that requires a bank to give them money they actually care about.  Such a thing will never exist.  It's only when a bank is able to make money for free that it's not a risk to give out a shitty loan, if literally any loan will make them money.  

I just wrote a fucking shitload but my last few sentences is what it comes down to.  Banks can give out loans at will so long as the government lets them.  Only the government's leash determines how bad loans can be as they are given out, because the truth is, banks, not the central bank that holds them up, but the commercial banks that distribute loans do so because that is their primary form of profit.  To loan is create money, to create money is to make money.  If you can't create money, you can't make bad decisions based on loans or you will end up loaning out money you have and it won't come back.

"> The government and central banks can rightfully go fuck themselves, but how would bitcoin destablise the economy? It's money, not a government.

That's kind of the problem.

A US Dollar is a dollar (more or less). People around the world know what it is and what it can buy and have a pretty good idea what it will be worth tomorrow or next year.

A bitcoin, is *much* less predictable. It was worth $100 a few years ago, then $1000, then $10,000. 

While this is just wonderful if you own some and have confidence in it, it's not wonderful if you want predictability, because the value is literally based on ""nothing"". 

Bitcoins are hard to generate because they're based on known-difficult math problems, but that doesn't mean they're inherently valuable.

The run up from $100 to $10000 can just as easily go the other direction.

The US$ used to be backed by gold. Now it's backed by ""the full faith of the US government."" If anything were to happen to the USD (eg a competitor to the dollar) that undermines people's faith in the government's ability to pay back its debt, it could lead to inflation which would place the government itself at risk.

"Not necessarily an imbecile, I think he's simply not quite able to see the potential of the network effect. Hence his ""the internet is a fad"" statement back in the 90s(which he now says was intentionally meant to be provocative), the reasoning he used there was that making it easier to communicate doesn't really mean much when most people don't have anything to say to one another. 

That wasn't wrong, if the internet had failed to advance past essentially being a paperless fax machine it probably would not be the absolutely essential part of modern life that it is; but that prediction fails to see that once a certain level of saturation was reached it would fundamentally change the way communication happens. People having a little website with a bunch of information about themselves on it that people they know can look at like the world's worst baseball cards doesn't sound impressive until everyone you know is using it and it's called Facebook.

I'd say Bitcoin is similar. When it was just some nerds trading computer pixels for alpaca socks and heroin it sounded stupid to anyone who didn't see the potential of an accounting system that has built into itself a verification for each transaction's validity. Now we're just starting to see the potential. I'm sure this is a metaphor people use a lot, but we're in the Myspace phase of crypto.


I think economists collectively are slow to see the potential of new technology because economics doesn't change much on the whole.

"I don't have a background in economics so this is all based on what I'm aware of. Within a closed system yes, which is what inflation is about. If too much money is created and the amount of goods remain the same, then the price of the goods will increase, because the value of the money has gone down. (this can happen if the Federal Reserve in the USA, for ex. makes some sort of ""miscalculation""). 

The thing with Cryptocurrency is that, it allows people to create money of the thin air. Because our current economic system is based on someone making money at the expense of someone losing money. If I sell something for 500$ all is well and stable, because there is a 0 net transaction. If I buy 500$ worth of bitcoins and make 1000$, then I've literally added 500$ to the economic system, which should result in some inflation. The ""issue"" is that bitcoin is difficult to trace and unpredictable, so the economic system that is in place now has to play catchup.

"A number of things, but the most damning one is that it simply isn't a good currency. The most important quality for a currency is stability; without that, people will either hoard it or ditch it and use something else to make their purchases. The value of a currency is supported by the confidence of the people who use it; in the case of the USD, that's primarily confidence in the stability of the US economy. In the case of Bitcoin, there's no real grounding. For a few die-hard libertarians it might be enough to believe in the infallibility of the free market, but for the average person there's no good reason to think that a Bitcoin will be worth tomorrow what it is worth today. 

Decentralization is marketed as a feature (which it is, if you're paranoid about government conspiracy) but it also means there's no one to step on the brakes if the train goes off the rails. For investors looking to make money that might be an acceptable risk, but I don't know many people who'd be willing to gamble their children's future on it.

"Transfer cost and slow block confirmation. 

It cost money to send money to another account even you control. This is starting at times to be a considerable amount of money that can cost more than just PayPal or other already established legitimate options to send money. 

It can also sometimes take an hour or more to get the agreed confirmations. If you agreed to 5 confirmations, it's about an hour even on the low end of 2 or 3 confirmations your looking at a least 20 minutes. 

The one I seen so far do it right is dogecoin. Transfer of dogecoin only cost 1 dogecoin regardless of the amount of coins transfer. Confirmations take about a minute. Which is still not perfect but acceptable. 

The thing that sucks about dogecoin is it is valued at 0.0002 USD and there is no limit to the amount of coins that can be mined. 

In the real world the transfer speed and confirmations would kill crypto.

It kind of is. Yes, unlike the government, a person or corporation can't print more money, but that's not really fixing the government's problem in the long term either. It's only devaluing its money. It's pretty comparable to a person taking out a massive credit card debt with no limit. As long as that person keeps working forever and never has any problems and keeps paying their credit card bill, it'll be fine. Just like that that's an unlikely scenario, so is the government not having any problems. Nothing's free.

"Thanks for the info. That's a perspective I don't have first hand experience with. 

I would have expected it to be like you said though. Making money from money is infinitely more profitable than making something that actually adds value, so I would assume that the increase in food production would barely maintain the standard of living for those of that industry.

I would be interested in getting your perspective on...uh... I don't even know the term for this... maybe ""Farming centralization""? My expectations are that there is/has-been a massive shift and pull towards people working as employees on larger farms, and small farm owners slowly getting driven out of business as farms are owned by fewer and fewer people. Then the larger farms are able to produce more food more cheaply, further driving out small farmers. 

Can you speak to this in any way? I have no actual real-world data on if that is actually happening, but I see it happening in so many other industries I assume it HAS to be happening in farming. I would love to hear anything you have to say on the subject.";1;0;False;Kieroshark;dqrh6aa;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

"Is a new country's currency not considered a store of value while it's new and volatile? The volatility has been incredibly extreme but it's been up consistently over the long term as more people adopt it. I consider it like the internet itself forming a new currency the same way a new nation would. Sure, it currently has *more* volatility than other things because it's still undergoing adoption, but all assets have volatility... where do you draw the line? I just don't see something having volatility as an exclusion to it being a store of value. 

A smart place to store your value? That's up to the individual. A textbook definition store-of-value? Yes. ";1;0;False;WontFixMySwypeErrors;dqrdy8k;This Bitcoin chart is insane! Oh, wait… that’s actually a chart of US dollar money printing.;7guh08;https://i.redd.it/a582ruk7ta101.jpg

The video talks about open sourcing and about 50% of the mining pools supporting ""RSK merged mining"" but also about ""federation members"" which leads me to wonder if this is now still some ""federation holds your money while you use it on rootstock and might spend it on your behalf when you leave rootstock"" construct or are we talking about the full and decentralized two way peg here?";2;0;False;giszmo;dqqzkt1;Guys I’m selling;7hgjmx;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hgjmx/guys_im_selling/
"Read through some stuff on Rootstock, RSK, and sidechain/drive-chains.

My experience is based on working for a very large technology company running digital currency projects, and I will say the entangling of these chains will be difficult to scale, and when problems occur recovering these contracts may not be possible. I expect some lost coins, blockchain corruption, etc.

Rootstock's explanation is far from exhaustive, and they don't address disaster recovery, or exactly how they plan to onboard legitimate miners by taking on more chain-risk for ""RSK"" tokens. 

The adoption curve suggests that it will be centralized for a while, or unstable as the bitcoin network is larger than anyone running entangled miners.

I expect BCH to take on more of these innovations as they learn to compete with BTC, and right now the centralization of exchanges for ether smart contracts. While theoritically I expect tech like this to continue to evolve, more op codes will be needed to increase security and reduce the need to trust special miners, which will require forks.";7;1;False;SkepticalFaceless;dqr0dlk;Guys I’m selling;7hgjmx;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hgjmx/guys_im_selling/

"> you are still buying something for 250,000 of a currency that starts at 1

That's partially true... but the reality is that the currency in the US is really cents. We just arbitrarily treat 100 cents as a single unit, but if a dollar truly were a single unit, then cents would be a fiction... and they're not. You can literally hold one cent in your hand, collect 100 of them and redeem them for a one dollar note or coin without going through any third party, and everyone respects that transaction as core to the economy.

... which is just as arbitrary as saying that $1m is the real unit and everything else is just a sub-division.

> To be able to buy a car for literally less than one...

But the ""one bitcoin"" concept is even more arbitrary, since the resolution of the currency was set extremely arbitrarily. The only fundamental unit in the BTC world is really the Satoshi (1/100m BTC). And so, in the same sense that a ""cent"" is the fundamental unit of what we call USD, the Satoshi is the fundamental unit of BTC.

"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"Having to comb through an extreme amount of memes and shitposts is a fairly new development and I believe that it's a side effect of bitcoin's dramatic rise in value. Pure speculators who don't believe in bitcoin itself will upvote easily digestible memes to the front page, which only brings more of these uninformed speculators to the subreddit.

We get the pleasure of seeing our capital rise in value, but the quality of the discussion takes a dive and it hurts bitcoin's image. A single good meme to celebrate every small milestone ($1,000) is fine, however constant all time high alerts whenever a rally happens are awful.

These people are the ones who cause 20%+ dips because they're so quick to think that bitcoin is crashing to zero at the first sign of a small dip. I think that the next bad news related to regulation is going to have a very brutal effect on the price because of them.

I'd happily trade some of the insane price increases for curious users who know what bitcoin is and how it works before they make their first purchase.

The guy who replied ""Borringg"" under my comment gives ammo to the people who shout ""bubble"" whenever bitcoin is mentioned. My average cost is low enough that I'll be able to weather an insane temporary crash or a lasting price correction, but I don't want bitcoin's image to be damaged while our beloved cryptocurrency is in the spotlight.

Good for you! The fact that bitcoin is very volatile and isn't currently being used by a lot of people are great reasons to sell and reduce risk. Of course, a lot of us here believe that these things will change in the future, the fact is that *right now*, bitcoin is both high-risk and relatively limited in terms of usefulness for the average joe.

**We should not discourage people from selling!** Bitcoin can only be *part* of a responsible financial plan and many people have a low tolerance for risk. We should *not* encourage risk-averse people to buy until bitcoin itself exhibits fewer indicators of risk. I'm happy with encouraging people to buy who are knowledgeable about the risks, but we should never let our excitement about bitcoin lead us to recommend decisions that aren't consistent with each person's personal needs and orientation toward risk.";0;0;False;;dqr7uvg;Guys I’m selling;7hgjmx;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hgjmx/guys_im_selling/

">  Bitcoin is yet another step forward, being even easier to store and trade in today's online world.

In theory. In practice, it could end up unusable as a currency simply because of the fees and because it's so slow, especially since other rival altcoins have superior tech. I speculate however it will however still be valued because of its rarity, just like gold.

> Gold has at least some intrinsic value as a useful material.

What has happened - and I wish this were an exaggeration, but it's really not - is that each individual arm of the US Federal government has ruled that Bitcoin is whatever allows them to regulate it the most. To the people in charge of regulating monetary instruments (FINCEN) it's money. It's property/a capital asset to the IRS. It's now at least becoming a security in the view of the SEC.

"You are correct, thanks for the correction.

It is even lower than the highest tax bracket at 200 adjusted gross income and 250 for married.

That is a real bummer as it at first glance look like a surtax that is only used for certain cases when the reality is that there are only some few exception to the rule.

I understand why they did it that way, if they had increased the capital gains tax from 15 to 18,8% for gross income at 200k and increased from 20 to 23.8% it certainly feels like the real capital gains tax increase that it is.";2;0;False;964d72e72d053d501f29;dqq28by;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"> Noone is stealing from you.

Yes they are.

> Giving up a fraction of your earnings is a necessary and fundamental payment for the innumerable systems and processes that enabled it in the first place.

You are right. They need all of our money to pay for the innumerable (and nearly all unnecessary) systems, ""services"" and God knows what else that has us trillions in debt.

> It's an exchange probably as old as neanderthals trading food for sex.

Don't give a shit. Argument from age fallacy.

> Tax amendments and reform is a continuous issue. If you don't like certain aspects of it, take it up with lawmakers and representatives as part of your Civic duty.

Yes.

Definitely wrong. Making a stink about issues is what puts them on the cultural map and the more people who hear it, the better.

"I generally believe that less is more when it comes to government.

The arguments of Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell resonates strongly with my spirit and I think that Hayek was right.

I will also make the case for civil disobedience when laws are unjust and it is done with a specific purpose and without violence or personal gain.

But there is no option to make exceptions for bitcoin or any other asset or currency. Currently we pay taxes on capital gains for all property and currency, we might be better of if taxation came from other sources and was more limited. But as long as people hold the view that the wealthy live of their capital gains and ordinary people live of their wages there will be a political push towards taxation of capital gains.

Government in general have a tendency to grow and the more dependent people are on governmental services the more they vote for increasing the reach and size of government. It is a fundamental shift in how people see human nature and the role of government.

"It might be worth realizing that early Bitcoin was _hugely_ associated with libertarianism. It's not a coincidence that it was launched shortly after the 2008 financial crisis; even the genesis block contains a message that is most easily interpreted as political commentary against governments' actions in handling the crisis: [""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block).

The point of this is that libertarians generally aren't fond of taxes. Several will go as far as to say that ""taxes are theft"", and probably more are comfortable claiming that they don't _owe_ their government anything.

"If I have Google stock and want to trade against Cisco, I must first convert the Google stock to USD creating a taxable event. I then purchase the Cisco stock with that USD and once again have a taxable event once I move back to USD and then into Google. In order to buy one or the other, one must constantly convert back and forth to USD.

Now, if I purchase something with bitcoin, the IRS is pretending that I cashed out first to USD and then used the USD to purchase whatever it is that I bought. The reality is, however, that I never used USD whatsoever and never required it. 

The issue here isn't what the IRS thinks or will do or how they will interpret the law. The issue is that the current laws are a threat to cryptocurrency use as money. 

Within the cryptoeconomy, everything is being measured in bitcoin. Other cryptos are being priced in bitcoin and rise and fall in relative tandem with it. The cryptoeconomy is essentially like a sovereign state, where everything in that country is measured in the national currency. Within the country, the relative pricing of goods and services is unaffected by the currency's value against foreign currencies. A loaf of bread may cost $10, for instance, regardless of whether the USD has risen or fallen against the British pound. The same principle applies with bitcoin. The price of bitcoin relative to an altcoin like Ethereum remains based on the two currencies' relative position, and this relation is more or less indifferent to the value of outside currencies (like the USD). If Ethereum costs 0.036 bitcoin, it will still more or less cost 0.036 bitcoin even if bitcoin rises in USD terms. 

Consequently, taxing crypto use calculated in USD is like citizens of a sovereign country being taxed by a foreign state in the foreign state's currency based on relative changes in value between the currencies. So a person goes to buy a loaf of bread, only to be later told that the currency appreciated so much against the other just at the time they purchased that bread, but then latter collapsed in value, that the person now owes their life savings in taxes for having purchased that loaf of bread.

"The powerful have already carved out an exception like the one you are expecting. Typically it is used for real estate, but I can see it construed to apply to crypto. There are a lot of rules about conversion to cash, but that is specifically being avoided already. My quick reading of it says securities are excluded, but is doesn't say anything about cryptocurrencies.

It would be interesting how a trade to USDT would be classified. Listening to the FUD, apparently there is no contractual obligation for USD redemption. Worse even than that, I would hate to try to explain to my accountant about BitUSD, or NuBits.

I wonder how I can mail something to Poloniex. How do I mail something to EtherDelta?

While a scheme like this wouldn't result in selling when you weren't ready, it would still be an incredible paperwork burden for both the trader and the IRS.

"probably value at time of transaction.  $600 and less transactions need not be reported. Property loss is only $3,000 max.  I assume most here are capital asset, not counting bitcoin to bitcoin merchant transactions. Here is the IRS  brief summary:

The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:

Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.

Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.

The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.

A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.

"Anything that has an market price and is possible to trade can function as a currency.

What is special about currency compared to other assets is that it can be tied to a country and units of it can be created by lending. The laws, import and exports, foreign demand for the currency, economic growth and monetary policies of a country all interact with the price of a currency and the price of the currency mainly affects the trade for that country.

The common goal of most modern countries is that the currency is stable and that the currency loses 2-3 percent of its buying power internally every year.

There is one thing that is the same with bitcoin and currencies, if there is high demand for a currency it will rise in price, but that is true for everything.

The main difference with bitcoin is that there is no country that has any control over bitcoin, and no country that uses bitcoin as their only currency.

This could change in the future, countries that have had their own currency fail sometimes switch to a foreign currency. If the market cap of bitcoin reaches a level comparable to the dollar or euro and have the same stability over time, a country in the future that had their own currency fail may chose to adopt bitcoin instead of another currency.

The problem is that the economy grows and if there is no way for the money supply to grow to stop the value of the currency from growing everyone will stop using the money for trade and just sit on it. As long as bitcoin is used and the economy grows it will increase in value over time. Even when it stabilizes it will grow in value compared to the other currencies at the rate that they expand their money supply, which has been a bit over 6% for the US over the last 16 years.";1;1;False;964d72e72d053d501f29;dqqxifv;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

In Switzerland, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are treated as foreign currency and as such they have to be declared together with the other standard assets (bank accounts). So the tax department doesn't care if I did 1 trade with a bit loss and a trade with a big win to compensate the loss... What they want to know is how many assets and coins I have and their value at the end of the year. So in my example in Switzerland one can declare the stocks value to 0 (because they were all sold) and declare the purchased coins (value based on the currency exchange rate at the end of the year).

In USA: have fun guys declaring each one of your transactions, especially if you are a day trader or if you have a trading bot that does many micro transactions every day!

"I agree with this view. It would be great if the IRS could just collect a form 1099 as with a traditional brokerage, but that's not what they're after here.  The longer they wait to provide clear guidance to individuals and exchanges the worse the problem of tax reporting and collection will get.
I am also troubled by the overreach here - this coming from a patriotic individual who believes in the necessity for social cooperation (and taxes).  I see this as just an inefficient means of collecting information that potentially puts my personal information at additional risk to hacks/leaks because of all the extra data generated.

"Thank you for this. Just one follow up question, and I'll quote the section of your writing that spawned the question first:

>Currencies is a unit that is used for trade in one and more countries and between countries. The value of the currency is relative to all other currencies and depends on the monetary policies of the countries that have them, trade between countries and the sort of markets that use it. Petroleum being traded in USD from countries that themselves do not use USD as a national currency for example.

Can't you buy bitcoin in currencies that aren't dollars? Am I mistaken in thinking that bitcoin fits all of this?

However, given that:

>it should be noted that if I buy 1 Euro for 1 dollar and sell that euro for 2 dollars later i pay ordinary income taxes on the difference. Bitcoin being classified as property means lower taxes, not more.

"Yes, the requirement itself to track and report basis and gains on every. single. transaction (if you were to spend bitcoin for everything you currently spend fiat on) is extremely onerous (particularly the way bitcoin works; out of so many different wallets and services and change addresses). 

The tracking and reporting is much worse than the paying of the tax. You might be some hotshot trader and you're all set up with software to track all this up front...but most people, they're just trying to live their lives and buy and sell the things they need, and there's no way they'd ever consider using bitcoin instead of dollars when they learn what they have to add to their daily accounting and year-end tax preparations. 

Most people have a really hard time just filing income tax with software (that is actually pretty confusing and time consuming if you're not a very standard case of income), and most people don't have a tax accountant...and no tax accountants until recently, had any idea how to handle bitcoin. 

Many people got into bitcoin before anyone had a clue that it was going anywhere; whether it would be taxed; how it would be taxed. They didn't or don't know, until after the fact, that they would make gains so high that it wi'll be worth their while to track or to use an accountant...so now they're in a bit of a no-mans land.

Regardless of these special cases which obviously won't be so much an issue in the future...you need to understand that the irs's classification is indeed a huge factor in preventing bitcoin being used as a currency.

Would treating it as a foreign currency be worse? I don't know. I don't care. The point is for government to get the fuck out of our business altogether and quit preventing markets from working. These taxes aren't even the half of how governments are screwing with bitcoin's development.

Next time you're tempted to think that bitcoin is failing or inferior, or some kind of wild-west reflection of free markets and why we need government...you'll know better.";2;1;False;kwanijml;dqq8b8n;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"I think eventually they will do the same to other exchanges which deal in $USD-to-crypto trading.

"No. With stocks and mutualmfunds, you dont incurr a tax until you actually sell. So if you hold for ten years and its skyrocketing, you might not be on the hook for anything until you sell in the tenth year.

"Inevitably this will happen.  The IRS works *SLOW* as fuck.  Like, right now, they are probably working on who gets audited for the 2014-2015 tax years which is probably why they asked for records from that time period.

Eventually they will require exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini to start reporting this on a 1099-DIV or they'll come up with a new form 1099-CRYPT or something.

The hard part will be determining cost basis for some transactions.
