"$800 is for two tickets. Once inside, there is no money exchanged (except for coffee and Ice, which the profits are donated to the local town).

It's a gift community, so if you want a beer at the corner bar, you go in, and ask for a beer. You pay nothing. If you are nice, you might give something back to the bartender. This could be an orange, a home-made necklace, or a tab of X. Who knows. You could also give them a hug. There aren't any rules, per-se about what to give and how.  There are no corporate logos or companies inside. There are no booths selling crap.

There's plenty of free massages, drinks, rides, art, ect. They just don't cost admission or anything. 

$800 is a little light. After you buy gas, food, and shelter to cover yourself in 114F heat- you might run a little higher than $400 ticket + $400 of supplies.";2;1;False;flickerkuu;cjr9v07;This guy scammed a scammer! (x-post /r/justiceporn);2dlord;http://imgur.com/a/tR48B

I don't know if you had this experience, and if you did what your feelings would be, but this is what many people experience when they get scammed, and I know for a fact that some of these people go on to scam other people after experiencing this, or at least consider it for a while before moving on. Also many of these people lose considerably more than $185. I know people who get scammed out of several thousands of dollars.

I am aware of people whom this happened to, and when they then went on to scam other people, they'd start out by explaining to the mark (for example someone posting on a forum that they wanted to trade BTC using PayPal -- or whatever way they got scammed themselves) the risk of getting scammed by transacting in this way, and recommend safer avenues, and then if the mark ignores this advice and chooses to transact with them anyway, then they scam the mark, and they say to themselves that if he was not doing it someone else would, and better the money goes to him. Sometimes the nouveau scammer will return some of the money and charge the remainder for the lesson taught to the mark, which he says will save the mark money in the future.

> As is the case with any tool, jury nullification is not a universal way to fix everything. That said, empirical evidence shows it to be an extremely powerful and effective tool. Jurors voting Not Guilty undermined the Fugitive Slave Acts and opened the door to Emancipation and the Thirteenth Amendment in the United States. Juror refusing to convict their neighbors under alcohol control laws brought about an end to alcohol prohibition in just 13 years. This past Valentine’s Day, we saw laws against same sex marriage take some major legal blows in two Southern states. But long before now, long before the U.S. Supreme Court’s historic ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, juries were refusing to convict under anti-cohabitation and anti-sodomy laws.

If they agree with you that it was necessary, they can use it themselves, and it can't even be proved that they knew about it beforehand (or if they would have known, you couldn't find anyone who didn't).

$800? Hmnn. I wish.  Tickets are around $400, bringing your crap and supplies out there might run $400 more if you want to live light and in misery, but I usually drop more like $2000 or more to be comfortable and have lots of shiny art and stuff. That's also a lot of gas included, as I usually bring out a truck and drive a long way to get there. ;1;0;False;flickerkuu;cjr9ofn;This guy scammed a scammer!
