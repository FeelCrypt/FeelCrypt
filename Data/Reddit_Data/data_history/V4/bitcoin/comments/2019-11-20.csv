"I trade options for my full time income. I usually just leg credit spreads into iron condors every 2.5 months. But, if I can already remember the highest point and the year, I can just buy extremely far OTM for $1 each, /r/WallStreetBets style.

I'm gunna spitball for a bit.

$TTD IPO'd in late 2016, and it hovered $22-$25 for a few months. It recently hit $290 this year.

Median American yearly income is around $36k. I would stash every penny away for this, but budget advice usually advises 10% saving rule. 

So that's $3.6k stashed from 2010 to 2016. That's $25.2k in 7 years. I'm not sure about historical options prices, but I'm pretty sure a $50 call 3 years out would be about $1. That would expect a 100% rise in the stock in 3 years. 

So load up on 25,200 $50 calls for $1 each. Assuming volume is too low to exit at $290, we can try to exit at $280 because it hovered there for a while. 

Then since each option is a contract for 100 stocks, you have control of 2,520,000 stocks. You bought a $50 contract, so each share has a net profit of $280 - $50 = $230. 

$230 profit on 2,520,000 shares is $579,600,000.  $TTD has 4.8 million shares outstanding, so it's possible.  So you'd make a little over half a billion in profit.

Luckily these prices are from the middle of this year, so it's pretty easy to remember what year you went back in time.

You could then take the gains and buy $200 Puts cause $TTD did fall to $180 afterwards. 

You'd probably get a call from the SEC and IRS though. But I'm sure Bitcoin millionaires got a call too.";1;1;False;Azntigerlion;f85yhjs;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg

"You are changing the original starting point in your analysis. Rather than starting with $1, you are talking about $25,000. $25,000 * $160,000 = $4 billion (and sure, I'm overestimating here assuming you put $25k in at the very beginning rather than $3.6k a year, but if we are talking about trading look at my edit and see how you could turn $1 into $190MM on around 8 trades, just knowing the peaks/troughs and not worrying about having to actually know the exact timing.  
  
I will concede that it isn't impossible to do it with options trading, but I still argue it is easier with knowing the price history of bitcoin and would take less effort. You bring up a good point about the share float/moving the market yourself, so I am sure my $190MM might have some influence and the actual number would be different.";0;1;False;wighty;f860gy0;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg

"The hypothetical is malformed, ignorant of physics.

I cannot ""wake up in 2010.""

Though it may be a fun thought experiment.

Even if I could, I'm not sure I could be convinced that anything I did would produce any more or less reliable results.

I have no guarantee that anything is going to be as I remembered it from 2010-2020, and I have at least one sample indicating it is different: the fact that I'm experiencing it again - and that the experience is different.

Nothing I could do would be in isolation, as I am not some atemporal empty state / classical system ""collapsing"" a wave-function.  I'm in a state of superposition as well as anything else I interact with.

"My question is: how would you buy bitcoin back then? When I first heard about it, i think it was 6 cents and I thought you had to mine it, so I downloaded the mining program or whatever on filehippo and spent like weeks checking to see if I got anything. I think I have a laptop in the garage with either .3 or .03 bitcoin. I gave up on it.. If I had known how to buy it I would've tossed a Hundred bucks in the ring. But I had no clue you could buy it.. That's my major regret, I wanted it, didn't really have the equipment to mine so I gave up on it..

It's not like I was poor or anything, I would have at least put a hundred bucks in.. I just had no fucking clue where you could buy it. I honestly thought it was meant to be a mine it yourself currency.";1;0;False;kluger;f85jlwd;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg

"Technically Bitcoin has only had 60,705% gain of all time while Litecoin has had a 79,628% gain of all time. This is at current values as well so, we can double our BTC percent to get closer to it's all time high and 6x litecoin to get closer to it's all time high.

"I would NOT buy Bitcoin. I would contact the developers and ask them to change some things:

1. Make the output structures of all coinbase transactions the 'coinbase' and omit the input structures.
2. Omit the input structures from all non-coinbase txs in new blocks before they're hashed.
3. Always prune spent transaction outputs and discard empty blocks when they become the oldest (last) block.
4. Discard blocks older than ten years or 525,600 blocks to get rid of lost transaction outputs.
5. Subtract lost coins from the coin supply and extend the block reward so that it returns to 21 million.";-10;2;False;SapphireSpire;f83mgnu;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
