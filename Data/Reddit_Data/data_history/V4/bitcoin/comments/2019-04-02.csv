He’s likely just guessing but it’s the opposite of a flash crash.  As the price rises the shorts go red and are forced to buy to cover their position.  More buyers push the price up.

"People buy brands primarily. Secondly they buy value. If your alt has a strong brand and provides good value, you are good.

Bitcoin has a very strong brand. Appr. half the world has heard about it and millions trust it. It’s synonymous with crypto in most cases, like google is synonymous with web search. The advantage here is virtually insurmountable. There is lots of competition among alts. They mostly fight each other for the second, third, etc place to be most known after Bitcoin. Will it be XRP, ETH, LTC, Nano? Nobody knows. 

Bitcoin has a great value as the most decentralized and most secure crypto that transfers the most value daily and has multiple second layer and sidechain projects as well as base layer improvements in the works. Ethereum has proven itself to be not censorship resistant and not safe losing hundreds of millions in value in faulty contracts. All alts are way more volatile than Bitcoin and smaller blockchains are routinely hacked. Low general acceptance makes them less valuable for the common man. Alt networks may be able to create better value than bitcoin, but they have a strong competition with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin can theoretically take their best ideas and take away their advantage. Again, tough challenge. 

Currently, Bitcoin is your best best long term. The rest is gamble. ";11;2;False;binarygold;ejxm0ky;Good to see you again;b8ek6w;https://i.redd.it/owozm3bi6sp21.gif

What I'm trying to say is that people and especially algorithms react to news headlines without doing a comprehensive read - and that could (and probably did in this case) create that initial momentum for a big market move. This April Fool's joke was also on more than one news site by the way. So even though I appreciate the positive move this brought to the market, I also think that a lot of traders got stopped out and lost a good deal of money due to a hoax.  ;-1;1;False;MonkeyWithAClue;ejy7as2;Good to see you again;b8ek6w;https://i.redd.it/owozm3bi6sp21.gif

"It might pull back a little later this week, but it might not. Crypto is unpredictable.

My recommendation is to follow overarching trends and not be too concerned with getting in on a red day. We seem to be at the end of an extremely long bear market, where the resistance set the price at 3.8k-4k. Now is as good a time as any to get in. Though it wouldn't be a terrible idea to wait a week or so to see if the trend solidifies, but it really just depends on how risk averse you are.

Two pieces of advice though: hold long term, and don't put in more than you're willing to lose.

Putting in more money than you are comfortable losing will make you do stupid and panicky things. Remember that this is an extremely volatile investment, meaning high risk *and* high reward (people tend to forget about the high risk part until there's a -20% day).";1;0;False;motions2u2wipemyass;ejys4pn;Good to see you again;b8ek6w;https://i.redd.it/owozm3bi6sp21.gif
