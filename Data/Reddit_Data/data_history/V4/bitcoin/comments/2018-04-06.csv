"> Trust in the solvency of banks did not reduce trust in the value of the dollar.

Because the dollar was pegged to gold.

The preference was clear: gold > dollar > deposit receipt.

> People resorted to barter because deflation caused money hoarding to become so common that it started collapsing the productive economy by distorting the price mechanism, as people went from using money to produce value to just sitting on it.

You basically argue that ""people"" had ""wrong"" preferences. Saving over consumption, liquid assets over illiquid assets. I would argue the market would have cleared that eventually.

The only real problem, that you point out so pointedly, with reference to penny candies is divisibility. A technical issue that Bitcoin has overcome.

> When you have 10% deflation then any productive investment that gets you less than 10% return on investment isn't worth the effort. If investing in a factory that employs 1000 people will only get you 9% return on investment, then why both employing all those people to produce goods and services when you can just do nothing and make more money?

In other words, if an investment has a negative return (9%-10%=-1%) it should not be realised. What we see today, with negative interest rates is very similar in that the government tries to manage the economy through price manipulation.

"If the economy only existed in a single instance of time, then you'd be right, we could move the decimal point on all units of currency and it wouldn't affect anything, as long as they were all affected equally.

However, trade occurs over time, and changing the value of currency over time transfers value and distorts the price mechanism, which has a direct impact on the proper functioning of economies.

Let's say you're a business man, and you own a million dollar factory, that employs 100 people and provides a 5% annual return in profit ($50,000 a year after expenses and taxes).

If you have 6% deflation, whether because the supply of currency is not increasing as fast as the supply of goods and services, or whether because currency is being taken out of circulation (lost, destroyed, hoarded etc), then it now becomes more profitable to sell the factory for cash than to keep it.

If you sell that factory for $1,000,000 cash, you will now be making an extra $10,000 equivalent in value without any of the concerns of running the factory.

Not only that, if you *don't* sell your factory, that factory will now lose 6% of its value every year ($60,000 in the first year), so you will actually be losing wealth overall by keeping your wealth as a productive factory than as cash.

This is what causes deflationary spirals. Everyone starts selling off assets for cash (causing massive oversupply which drops prices even further and makes it even more urgent to sell off your assets, which causes more people to hoard which pulls more currency out of circulation which increases the rate of deflation), which initially benefits people by making things cheap, but starts to destroy economic production as people shift from investing in productive assets to hoarding cash. The fact money is now worth more means nothing because everyone is now making much less money because fewer people are being employed generating goods and services, so people have less money to buy goods and services from other companies.

All deflation is good for is transferring value from holders of wealth in other forms, to holders of wealth in currency, and since currency only generates wealth by facilitating trade this is not a good thing for a currency.";1;1;False;suninabox;dwwooef;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"You mean like India just banned bitcoin and China is on their way? Unless it’s banned every where then it still survives. Any fiat is just as vulnerable to the law (made by someone with bigger guns), crypto and fiat have the same vulnerability in that respect. India recently banned large denomination physical fiat currency. Iran just banned the USD. It’s hardly immune from this.

Yes there are many ways of enforcing the law, but fundamentally all those ways are eventually enforced by weapons. Sure u can send the police, u can fine people, economic sanctions, but ultimately u are enforcing it with bigger guns (eg swat teams, nukes etc). See North Korea or the second world war as an example (conquered Japanese territories were using Japanese currency until the bigger guns stopped that, North Korea is basically ignoring the us institutions and us law and enforcement and they can because they have big guns/nukes). For the guy on the street, he can ignore the laws if he wants, u can send him fines and nasty words but ultimately the only thing keeping him in his place is that eventually the govt will send someone with a bigger gun than his to enforce it (usually the police).

The monetary policy for bitcoin is very clear there are 21 million and that’s it, any changes have to be agreed by 51% of the miners. Bitcoin is deflationary but not all crypto is. There are cryptos that are inflationary like the USD. There are even cryptos that are tied to the usd. Hodl is more relevant for deflationary cryptos. That really comes down to the monetary policy of the individual crypto.

Iran in fact is moving towards its currency being crypto. Chile has basically already done it with petroleum dollars. These crypto are already backed by guns and government institutions. Really the only difference between these crypto and fiat is the implementation technology. 

As far as intrinsic value and value vanishing, both fiat and crypto have similar vulnerabilities. Though it could be argued that crypto at scale actually is a bit more resilient than fiat because for decentralised crypto you can’t just take out one entity to stop it, you have to take out all of them.

lacking perspective on volatility? Just look at the fx rate data. The major fiat currencies are so volatile that financial institutions have to pass on large fx spreads to consumers. The volatility of fiat is actually one of the reasons for crypto and why international transfers in fiat are so expensive. It’s also one reason why most major banks are evaluating it in some way or another. The volatility argument against crypto has zero basis.";2;1;False;bcyng;dwx1yyp;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"For a deflationary spiral to happen, the value of money has to increase faster than the returned offered by the average investment opportunity available in the economy.

I don't think that would normally happen without some external catastrophe, like the volume of world trade falling by half in the aftermath of a world-wide tariff war, say.

Absent an external catastrophe, if we are just talking about there being a fixed amount of money against a growing total material wealth that it represents, then some of the goods and services produced in a given year will be produce more efficiently than others.  That is, some businesses will have a higher profit margin than others.

The growth in the purchasing power of one unit of a fixed currency is going to result from the average growth.  Which means some of the business opportunities that people invested in over that year will have grown faster than deflation and others will have grown slower.

So, some investors will do better than if they had simply held onto their money, and others will do worse.

I don't see how that leads to a spiral.";1;1;False;SilencingNarrative;dwxm9an;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday. On this date the Federal Reserve confiscated all the gold from the US citizens.;89xoji;https://i.redd.it/8jctsd5xi1q01.jpg

"What I'm saying is that statement is not really a policy in the way that the fed says ""We intend to maintain inflation at 3%"" How many bitcoins there are says nothing about plans to manage value or volatility. ""We intend to have 21 million btc"" says nothing about the larger economy, which any good currency should serve.

You keep going back to zimbabwe, but that was a highly corrupt government with no respect for its economy. I'm not holding crypto to account for the sins of bitconnect. I think it reasonable that we keep the focus on both sides to the larger, more stable players.

And lets be clear, I have no problem treating bitcoin or any of the existing crypto systems as securities or assets, I can accept a place there for them. But as a currency, it needs to do two things first.

It needs to stabilize. And then it needs to demonstrate the ability to mitigate shocks to its system. Only then will buyers and sellers be willing to use them for transactions. Until then most of the interest in it will be speculation, just like gold.

"To your first point, yes bitcoin survives if its banned in India. But to those Indians it now only has value as a black market commodity. Iran banning the USD isn't the same because it was never intended to be thier currency. Its the US's. In fact the US generally doesn't like it when other countries peg their currency to the dollar.

""The monetary policy for bitcoin is very clear there are 21 million and that’s it""

That's not a policy, that just a set artificial scarcity. A policy would be something like ""We intend to maintain the supply of bitcoin at such a level that common consumer transactions do not fall below the minimum transaction size"" But for the reasons you said above, that can't exist. You have to get the majority to agree to every change.

""The volatility argument against crypto has zero basis."" When Bitcoin's value over the last year went up to over 10x is starting price and then fall 3x from there just because its expensive to transfer between other currencies, this isn't going to go anywhere useful.

"They would worry about civilian casualties whether the govt is fighting Iraqi or American insurgents. Politically you can't just massacre everyone. The capability is there but the political will isn't. Even people opposed to an insurgency and on the side of the government would be horrified if we carpet bombed some Iraqi or American city. Not to mention foreign govts. We had control over the Iraqi communications too. You don't think we monitored their cell phone networks? I've been on missions where we tracked people by their cell phones and they knew we were tracking them by their cell phone and they flushed it down the toilet. That happened. That wasn't enough to defeat dudes with rifles. The insurgency continued. All they need are rifles and they can fight on forever. Similar to what we saw in Vietnam and what we are seeing in Afghanistan. We would often arrest insurgents in Iraq with zip lock bags full of SIM cards. They would use new SIM cards for every call. 



ISIS came later. The invasion was in 2003. I don't think ISIS really became a thing in Iraq until like 2011. Maybe they did some minor things before that but it wasn't until we left that they became a force to be reckoned with. The country was relatively quite and being rebuilt for a few years but stupid decisions were made. Like disbanding the entire Iraqi military and banning anyone who was in the Bathe party from holding government positions (everyone who knew how to operate in a government capacity was in the Bathe party because that was the only party). Almost all the military aged men in the country were overnight unemployed. Iraq had like a million man army at the time. It was one of the largest armies in the world at the time. Also people who used to have power (Sunnis) were now losing power and they started the insurgency. It just grew from there. Al Qaeda was non-existent in Iraq before we came. They saw the opportunity once the insurgency was built to move in. A lot of them came from Syria. Then they were mostly in the Sunni areas because AQ is a Sunni thing. Just like ISIS is Sunni. Al Qaeda basically morphed into ISIS. Most of Iraq is Shiite. If you talk to a Shiite they are as befuddled by suicide bombing as any American which some people find surprising. Suicide bombing/ISIS/Al Qaeda are all Sunni phenomenons.  So Shiites are opposed to Al Qaeda and actively seek out and kill them. Al Qaeda blew up a bunch of the Shiite mosques. Al Qaeda would blow up people walking in Shiite pilgrimages to Najaf and Karbala. A lot of sectarian violence ensued. Saddam was a Sunni. So in pre-invasion Iraq Sunnis were the ones who got to go to universities. Sunnis became the generals. Sunnis were the ones controlling everything. But Sunnis were a minority. They opposed democracy because that meant allowing the majority Shiites to vote. When we had to work with the Iraqis you usually wanted to work with Sunnis because they were more educated (relatively) and usually better organized. Iraq never fully stabilized while we were there. Corruption was obviously rampant. Corruption wasn't even hidden. People would appoint all their family members to government positions and it was almost expected. When we pulled out of Iraq the insurgency was basically waiting for us to leave. They easily captured a bunch of equipment we sold/gave to the Iraqi army. I bet Iraqi army commanders just sold it to ISIS when they got the chance. ISIS basically conquered the entire Sunni majority areas of Iraq because they had the support of the people in those areas. They were getting close to Baghdad itself. They morphed from insurgency to regular militia with tanks and other vehicles. Captured Mosul. I'm sure we saved them from being conquered by ISIS with covert units, air strikes, and access to our intelligence gathering capabilities.




I'm going off on a tangent but the real take away is dudes with rifles have defeated the US Military in the past and are currently doing the same in Afghanistan in real time that you can watch. This isn't something that we can argue. It's literally happening right now and has happened in the past. Imagine how much harder an American insurgency would be! Americans are highly educated, wealthy, have access to tons of resources, oh and most importantly tons of AR-15s (the most popular rifle in America). It's a beautiful thing because it keeps tyranny at bay despite constant efforts to grow government and take away people's rights.

"No, the USD actually does change in value second by second. You can see this yourself at www.oanda.com or any forex exchange. In 1 year it dropped ~25% vs the EUR, AUD etc. same against the JPY, then back up a few months later. The prices denominated in Zimbabwe dollars increased 79 billion percent in one month (more volatility than any crypto ever). Freely floated fiat currencies such as the USD are very volatile.

The only difference between modern fiat and crypto is that successful fiat are backed by guns. Guns, tanks, bombers are the only thing that what gives them any more value than crypto. Other than that it’s usage acceptance and controlled scarcity - both have that. We saw in the case of Zimbabwe dollar that fiat is just as worthless as crypto if people stop accepting/using it.

Just as with crypto, anyone can create a new fiat currency. Microstates do this all the time. Their currencies have little value because few people accept them. Just as failed crypto currencies have no value because no one accepts them.

I don’t challenge that currently fiat currencies issued by a stable power are currently superior to commodities. Whether it will be superior in the future to crypto is still up for debate - hopefully we will live long enough to see.

">The demand for a given good or service in a set of people, at a given price, is the amount of it they would buy if the good or service sold for that price.

>I don't see how you have defined the demand for currency

I already said what effects the demand for currency, which is the amount of trade in goods and services but you didn't seem to like it. When you contrast this with the supply of currency, that is how the value of a currency is set.

There's already a formula to explain what sets the value of currency which is P = MV / Q, where M is the quantity of money, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level (i.e. value of currency) and Q is the level of expenditure on goods and services (in that currency).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange

If you imagine an extremely simplified economy, say an apple farmer, who has 100 apples, and in the economy there are 100 apple tokens, then there will be a 1:1 ratio between tokens and apples (ignoring velocity for simplicity). If the farmer grows another 100 apples, but the number of tokens remains the same, then there will now be 2 apples for every 1 token - deflation - each token now buys twice what it did. This is because there are now more things to trade relative to each token. If instead the farmer produced another 100 tokens without producing any more apples, then there would now be 2 tokens for every apple - inflation - each token now buys half of what it did previously.

The supply and demand is quantity (and velocity) of tokens for trade vs quantity (or rather overall expenditure) of things being traded. Those fundamental factors are in turn effected by thousands of secondary factors.


>Can you give me two scenarios, a and b, where in scenario b some set of people have more demand for currency than they did in scenario a?

In a community where everyone was self-sufficient and there was no trade the demand for currency would be 0. currency is worth only what someone will give you for it. If no one will give you anything for it, its worthless. The more things of value people are willing to exchange for a unit of currency (i.e. the more trade being conducted in that currency), the more demand for currency there will be. In order to maintain a constant value the supply of currency needs to keep pace with demand. If supply exceeds demand there will be inflation, if supply falls below demand there will be deflation.

That makes it valuable. Gold is well-suited to the task of being a currency for more reasons than “ooh shiny” as you originally claimed.

"That's why people pulled money out of banks and banks collapsed. 

It doesn't explain why people were resorting to barter when the quantity of available currency only decreased by 30%, which is roughly what it was 10 years before.

If what deflationists say is true, then just because the price of currency is going up doesn't mean people will spend less, or rather, people will only spend on necessities.

Trust in the solvency of banks did not reduce trust in the value of the dollar. If people were worried about the USD becoming worthless then they would be trying to get rid of it as fast as possible, not hoard it.

Prices falling by 30% doesn't mean everyone suddenly runs out of currency. As deflationists are keen to point out, you can simply use smaller denominations of currency. If something cost a dollar now you just pay 70 cents instead.

In 1930 basically nothing in the economy was priced at the lowest smallest divisible unit of currency (1 cent). Penny candies were still being sold during the great depression and they were basically the only good in the economy that would be effected by the inability to divide a penny.

People resorted to barter because deflation caused money hoarding to become so common that it started collapsing the productive economy by distorting the price mechanism, as people went from using money to produce value to just sitting on it. When you have 10% deflation then any productive investment that gets you less than 10% return on investment isn't worth the effort. If investing in a factory that employs 1000 people will only get you 9% return on investment, then why both employing all those people to produce goods and services when you can just do nothing and make more money?";2;1;False;suninabox;dwwnwkg;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

This provides employment (so builds a support base of drug addled whores) but generally just pisses away the money. Now imagine they took the money and instead of pissing it away they started a competing restaurant. Now you are not only out of the money but you are down the opportunity to expand your business into that land or hire those people, they may even poach your employees with the money they took from you. Of course if they do it on a grand scale it becomes hard to track exactly where you are losing your opportunities and the number of people supporting it expand to the point where they can become organized and educated in the art of supporting the theft and the economic circumstances push more and more people into making the choice to be recipients of the theft rather than victims of it and once in that situation it becomes hard to imagine what you lost if you where a capital owner or even if capital owning was not a thing under constant attack so there was more competition from them for labor and more wealth in it to fund the purchase of labor in real terms. ;1;0;False;MoneyPowerNexis;dww0gyl;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

">You basically argue that ""people"" had ""wrong"" preferences.

People were acting rationally in their own interests. It's possible to have a system where everyone acting rationally in their own self-interest makes everyone worse off. The prisoners dilemma is a classic example, but there are many real world examples of the same. Over-fishing is one. Fishermen are destroying their own industry by over-fishing even though they'd be better off if they fished at sustainable rates, because its in each individuals interest to participate in over-fishing rather than to abstain.

Economic output dropped by 30% during the Great Depression, yet prices went down, not up. In a functional market, a decrease in supply should increase prices to signal a need to increase supply and provide a profit incentive to meet it. Yet in a deflationary spiral, prices will keep dropping even when output decreases, which sends a false signal to the market that there is an excess of supply and to reduce supply further, when in fact there is no excess of supply just a shortage of currency. Businesses that would otherwise be profitable become unprofitable as prices are driven below cost, and go out of business to transfer value to currency hoarders.

>Saving over consumption, liquid assets over illiquid assets. I would argue the market would have cleared that eventually.

The markets attempt to solve gold/dollars being more profitable to hoard than to use as currency was people resorting to barter instead of using currency, which is incredibly inefficient.

Any sufficiently deflationary currency will be abandoned by the market.

The nations that abandoned the gold standard quickest had the fastest recovery during the Great Depression.

>The only real problem, that you point out so pointedly, with reference to penny candies is divisibility

I already pointed out it wasn't a problem even for the lowest denominated good during the Great Depression, so you can't blame that as the problem. If you could still sell penny candy during the Great Depression, what impact do you think divisibility was having?

>In other words, if an investment has a negative return (9%-10%=-1%) it should not be realised. What we see today, with negative interest rates is very similar in that the government tries to manage the economy through price manipulation.

"> What does it mean to talk about a nation's demand for currency?

Currency is trade tokens. If you don't have any trade going on you don't need any currency. The more things you are trading the more tokens you need to represent those things, the greater the demand for currency will be.

>If a nations demand for currency goes up over the course of a year, what changed during that year?

Specifically demand for trade of goods and services, abstractly a growing economy will tend to both increase the amount of goods and services available to trade, and the number of people with wealth to trade them.

We refer to gold standard as ""deflationary"", only because the supply of gold tends now to increase slower than the demand for currency, but this was not always the case. There have been several inflationary periods during the gold currency era, both when the economy has tanked and demand for trade in goods and services have dropped (this occurred during the civil war), and also when large new gold deposits were found and there was a sudden increase in gold supply above the present demand (this happened locally during many gold rushes).

"“As long as technology keeps advancing, then we are able to produce more units of (most) commodities per person hour of labor.

So if you measure prices in average person hours of labor over time, you would expect the price of most commodities to fall.”

1. This is speculative and while it sounds right, it isn’t because:

1a. Commodity costs are correlated to, but not completely determined by labor costs.

2. You’re not factoring the increase in the costs of the technology you’re mentioning. 

3. Correlated to technology increase we see expiration dates on current commodities. For example, we can produce horses at a 1000-fold rate than we could in 1850. And relatively cheaper as well I’m sure... But thanks to the same technology that you’re speaking of (cars/automated agricultural innovations/etc.) we no longer need horses in that same capacity.

"All you noobs apologizing for this guy have absolutely no idea what actually happened in the months leading up to closure of MTGOX. There where obvious problems with the exchange; bitcoin/fiat withdrawals were taking weeks to months to process and  Gox traded at a 10-20% premium. Karpeles continued to run the exchange, coming up with a bunch of bs reasons for the withdrawal issues. I remember one excuse was that the Japanese bank could only process 25 wires per day. It's unreasonable to believe that he didn't know they were insolvent, you cant't just lose 80% of customer funds and continue to operate normally, yet he continued to operate his exchange and take customer deposits up until the day GOX died. 

He was a coward that refused to face the music, so he decided to keep sipping fraps and banging Japanese whores - I can't say I wouldn't have done the same.

"I am hopeful time will help resolve most of the mysteries remaining around this case. Vinnik's trial will be a key point in this, as the US will submit their evidence against him for everyone to see.

I think the main issue with late bank deposits is that once a deposit enters the bank account, it has to go through AML before being credited. The trustee however didn't proceed with the checks which means deposits were stuck in pending status.

Also, it is difficult for a bank to not accept transfers. The fact is incoming transfers will cost money to the bank even if the receiving account is closed, but it can only take fees if the transfer is credited, so most banks will not want to reject transfers without a good reason.
