"**Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff**

Igor Yourievitch Osten-Sacken-Bogdanoff and Grichka Yourievitch Osten-Sacken-Bogdanoff (or Bogdanov; born 29 August 1949) are French television producers and scientific essayists who since the 1970s have presented various subjects in science fiction, popular science and cosmology. They were involved in a number of controversies, most notably the Bogdanov affair, in which it was alleged the brothers wrote nonsensical advanced physics papers that were nonetheless published in reputable scientific journals.

"He basically bought currency during a dip in value when it was cheap so when it bounced back, he would make profit as the value would rise.

The evil man on phone (it’s a joke there’s no single evil man controlling crypto like this) then said to keep dropping the value and the guy in a panic sold all his assets to not make a huge loss.

Then to torment him they raised the price a whole lot right after he panic sold to make him think he should have held on for a little longer.

Cue back and forth with them tormenting him with Bull  Flag signals (signals to suggest value will rise a lot) and  Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (**FUD**) from South Korea government news, even going as far as preventing him from killing himself to torture him.

Then finally, they give him false hope that things will be better with the increase in value of Tether, but it was a scam all along; they’re gonna kill him, take his assets for their own and do the same to another unfortunate soul.";3;0;False;Astronomer_X;dv4v0bz;When you are trying to buy the dip;81qkxp;https://v.redd.it/14187bzhakj01

-Possess psychic-like abilities

-Control france with an iron but fair fist

-Own castles & banks globally

-Direct descendants of the ancient royal blood line

-Will bankroll the first cities on Mars (Bogdangrad will be be the first city)

-Own 99% of DNA editing research facilities on Earth

-First designer babies will in all likelihood be Bogdanoff babies

-both brothers said to have 215+ IQ, such intelligence on Earth has only existed deep in Tibetan monasteries & Area 51

-Ancient Indian scriptures tell of two angels who will descend upon Earth and will bring an era of enlightenment and unprecedented technological progress with them

-They own Nanobot R&D labs around the world

-You likely have Bogdabots inside you right now

-The Bogdanoffs are in regular communication with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, forwarding the word of God to the Orthodox Church. Who do you think set up the meeting between the pope & the Orthodox high command (First meeting between the two organisations in over 1000 years) and arranged the Orthodox leader’s first trip to Antarctica in history literally a few days later to the Bogdanoff bunker in Wilkes land?

-They learned fluent French in under a week

-Nation states entrust their gold reserves with the twins. There’s no gold in Ft. Knox, only Ft. Bogdanoff

-The twins are about 7 decades old, from the space-time reference point of the base human currently accepted by our society

-In reality, they are timeless beings existing in all points of time and space from the big bang to the end of the universe. We don’t know their ultimate plans yet.

"Don't listen to the asshats who are ridiculing you for asking this question. You'd think there was a clause in Bitcoin that said *""You shall not dare to dabble with our precious cryptocurrency until you fully understand everything about how it works!""*

In a nutshell - 'owning' Bitcoin actually means that you have the private key(s) needed to 'spend' or 'send' your Bitcoin to someone else. There are a number of ways to store these private keys, including: having them written/printed on paper; having them stored in a software wallet; having them stored in a hardware wallet.

By 'owning' Bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase, you don't actually have these private keys - they do. They simply let you have an account with them, and this will show you how much of THEIR Bitcoin 'belongs' to you. Which is perfectly fine, as long as THEY don't go bust, and THEIR Bitcoin doesn't get stolen.

Think of it as the difference between keeping your jewellery in a box in your house, and keeping it in a locker down at the bank. Lots of people think that the bank (ie. Coinbase) is vulnerable to being broken into, or having the contents of its vault seized, hence the 'don't store your stuff there!' attitude.

Probably more of a concern is that because the bank only has so many people working there compared to how many people have their stuff stored in its vault, then should a time come when everyone wants to get their jewellery out and sell it, they will find the bank with a month-long queue and people rioting outside, stopping you from getting to yours.";27;1;False;_Pohaku_;dv44nxx;Coinbase Hit With Class Action Claiming Insiders Benefited From 'Bitcoin Cash' Launch;81kpg8;https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/02/coinbase-hit-with-class-action-claiming-insiders-benefitted-from-bitcoin-cash-launch/?slreturn=20180202195543

> The class action suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, appears to be the first filed in a federal court alleging insider trading-like claims over Coinbase’s announcement that it would handle transactions in Bitcoin Cash last December.

> According to the complaint, insiders drove up the price of Bitcoin Cash, also called BCH, by executing buy and sell orders moments after the move by Coinbase—one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world

Rumors happened and that's all it needs to have a bull run going.

"Not sure where you read or heard about Bitcoin/crypto related exchanges not falling under the jurisdiction of the SEC in the US but that's 100% incorrect. Repeating something false enough times doesn't change the reality. Bitcoin is public on Coinbase and it is an exchange of items considered securities. There was insider pump and dumping before launching BCH, with no transparency as to how/when they would provide a financial instrument that directly affects the price. This involved massive amounts of other people's money, and Coinbase is an American company.

>“Offers and sales of digital assets by ‘virtual’ organizations are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws” said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. The regulations apply to entities that use distributed ledger or blockchain technology, as in, ”Initial Coin Offerings"" or ""Token Sales.” Unregistered offerings will be liable for violation of federal securities laws.

This means that for most high-frequency or low-value payments, you should be able to send them through Lightning. Fees-per-transaction on this layer can sustainably remain near-zero.

If we want Bitcoin to remain capped at 21M coins, fees for on-chain confirmation cannot sustainably remain near-zero. But that is totally okay as long as trustless solutions that enable micropayments *do* exist; for fast or cheap payments, use Lightning (or a similar tool); for big and highly-security-conscious payments, go on-chain. The inflation subsidy can dwindle safely and Bitcoin can continue onward.

The block size limit has never actually been a ""problem"" in Bitcoin; it is a good thing, and we're very lucky that Satoshi was smart enough to put it into the consensus code (and leave it there despite many people trying to convince him to take it out or increase it). With the limit, Satoshi demonstrated his legendary genius and foresight yet again. But even so, we did increase the limit (technically the ""block size limit"" was removed entirely and replaced with a ""block weight limit"" when SegWit was activated), so now blocks can contain up to 4 million weight units each (a maximum of about 3.7 MB, though most blocks will probably never get much bigger than 2.3 MB in practice). A limit (especially a limit significantly lower than the constraints imposed by Moore's and Nielsen's respective ""Law""s) ensures that Bitcoin can remain decentralized and that the validation of its chain remains affordable by as many people and actors as possible. Scaling Bitcoin was never about ""removing size limits"" (that's just something stupid people repeat), it has always been about making intelligent trade-offs given the engineering constraints of the blockchain as a data construct.

So, basically, if you think that ""1 MB"" is a relevant figure in Bitcoin consensus code these days, your assumptions are 9 months out of date... and Lightning Network represents the introduction of a *trustless* second layer (effectively introducing ""unicast payments"" onto a broadcast paradigm); it's the *opposite* of forcing a new trust model into Bitcoin (and ironically, trying to increase the consensus limits naively *would* be forcing Bitcoin into a new trust-based model and pricing out the ability to exchange value without intermediaries).";4;0;False;thieflar;dv4avv6;Coinbase Hit With Class Action Claiming Insiders Benefited From 'Bitcoin Cash' Launch;81kpg8;https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/02/coinbase-hit-with-class-action-claiming-insiders-benefitted-from-bitcoin-cash-launch/?slreturn=20180202195543

I've been in bitcoin for quite some time now. When I first bought it was the tradehill days when you deposited into a random BoA account and a while later you got some bitcoin. I jumped on board with Coinbase as soon as they went live and the only issue I have had with them was verifying my credit card and they use a third party IIRC. The vast majority of complaints I see from people on here in regard to Coinbase are people who were all trying to join and get verified during the ridiculous surge in interest at the end of last year or people sending wires. Coinbase should have notified people earlier about pulling their BTC if they wanted to keep BCH during the first fork but it was something they still gave, what, 2 week notice over and had been a topic in bitcoin communities for months - so again, what specifically was unprofessional and do you have any recommendations going forward.

"The plaintiff might have a point, if the allegation is correct.... that they placed an order to buy BCH from Coinbase at one price, and then Coinbase executed the order at nearly twice the price  they showed when he placed the order.

As far as I know when you BUY a good or service,  the merchant has to provide it to you at Exactly the price you were shown at the time you committed the purchase,  not  1.5x the price, not 1.3x the price,  but 1.0x the price every time.

The exception would be if the buyer was on a trading exchange and committed a MARKET order  to buy the good from whoever on the market is selling the item at the best price ----  in other words  a  buy order matched against the best sell order;   in that case  the buyer specifically orders the brokerage to match them with a seller and give them their price without knowing it ahead of time;  in which case there'd be no claim against the broker ----  they didn't decide what the price would be,  the seller decided.

"Here is the entire article without paywall:

\-\-\-

Coinbase is facing a new lawsuit alleging that its employees and other insiders reaped huge gains by trading on nonpublic information that the cryptocurrency exchange planned to support transactions in a Bitcoin offshoot called Bitcoin Cash.

The [**class action suit**](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/403/11288/CoinbaseComplaint.pdf), filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, appears to be the first filed in a federal court alleging insider trading\-like claims over Coinbase’s announcement that it would handle transactions in Bitcoin Cash last December.

According to the complaint, insiders drove up the price of Bitcoin Cash, also called BCH, by executing buy and sell orders moments after the move by Coinbase—one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

The activity caused the value of the cryptocurrency to spike by 200 percent in the minutes after trading opened on Dec. 19, the complaint adds. That led Coinbase to temporarily freeze trading, and remaining Bitcoin Cash purchasers were forced to pay “artificially inflated prices that had been manipulated well beyond the fair market value of BCH at that time,” it alleges.

The complaint also says that, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly acknowledged suspicions of insider trading and [**pledged to undertake an internal investigation**](https://blog.coinbase.com/our-employee-trading-policy-at-coinbase-1d4e860b7837), “to date, neither Armstrong nor the company has disclosed the result of its purported investigation.”

The complaint was filed by Green & Noblin in Larkspur, California, and by The Grant Law Firm in New York. The named plaintiff, Jeffrey Berk, is an Arizona resident who alleges that his buy order for BCH was executed at roughly double the price as when he submitted it.

Coinbase did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about the lawsuit.

Although the complaint makes insider trading\-like allegations, it cites California’s Unfair Competition Law and common law negligence as causes of action—likely due to the fact that BCH is not currently regulated as a security. The Commodities Futures Trading Corp. has said that Bitcoin is a commodity.

BCH was created last year by what is known as a “hard fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain—the creation of a variant of the original software. According to the complaint, Coinbase initially suggested it would not handle transactions in BCH. The company later said it would begin supporting some transactions in BCH in January 2018 but then abruptly changed course by opening trading on Dec. 19, the complaint alleges.

In a [**subsequent blog post**](https://blog.gdax.com/bitcoin-cash-launch-retrospective-79c2eb7d9175), a senior Coinbase manager wrote that employees were notified about a month ahead of time that support for trading in BCH was coming. Those employees “were explicitly prohibited from buying and selling BCH,” he added. “All employees were also barred from sharing this information with anyone outside of Coinbase.”";15;1;False;McBurger;dv43r3r;Coinbase Hit With Class Action Claiming Insiders Benefited From 'Bitcoin Cash' Launch;81kpg8;https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/02/coinbase-hit-with-class-action-claiming-insiders-benefitted-from-bitcoin-cash-launch/?slreturn=20180202195543

"Posted this elsewhere:

The price of BTC fucking plummeted by over $1000 the second BCH was added to Coinbase.  I know I’m not the only person who was on Gdax at that moment when suddenly the price goes from $18500 or so to low $17000s in about a minute.  Then Gdax website goes down for many, only to come back up 30 min later with BCH added.

The crash all the way down to $8000 began the literal moment BCH was added.

Look [here](https://www.coindesk.com/price/) at the price of BTC in Dec 2017.  BCH was added to Coinbase on Dec 19.  Check out that huge $6000 drop.

Additionally, there is the issue of the price of BCH surging to over $8000 on Coinbase in under an hour after it was added, despite the fact every other exchange was trading it for around $3000.

"Disclaimer: I have BCH.

Thanks to the increasing fees of Bitcoin I switched to Bitcoin Cash since it has no fees. Now, anyone with half a brain can figure out that BCH has 8Mb blocks and BTC has only 1Mb blocks. Having bigger blocks as advantages and disadvantages: it IS cheaper to transact using BCH, but 8Mb blocks mean most miners can't run a full node so BCH is *more or less* centralized (more than 40% of mining BCH activities are in China or in virtualized environments such as AWS). Increasing blocks is a good strategy in the short term, but what happens when the 8Mb blocks are full? Then they plan to increase it again. This will mean only centralize it more.

I can't wait for SegWit to be the norm and for BTC to be a currency (as in to buy and sell stuff using it) again. BCH, as per the development plans of today, is not a good currency (as in to buy and sell stuff using it) for long term use.

"To add onto this...nobody really knows how much anyone owns in terms of BTC. Banks, governments and courts cannot force any individual with BTC to do anything with it because there's no solid way to prove current possession/ownership in the first place, without complete/honest cooperation of the potential owner.

A true analysis of ownership would take many many hours of expert analysis of transactions, a persons activity (like web browsing history + video footage) and even then, that does not offer a substantial conclusion, because BTC is lost/stolen often and can be moved quickly/easily. 

It's very difficult to prove when/how someone bought it, when/how someone sold it and who was involved in those transactions. Sure, there's the blockchain, but that just shows when and how much was moved. Says nothing about...from whom, to whom, what was exchanged for it (if anything), how much was exchanged, and the reasoning for the movement. If anonymity is desired, it can be achieved with less effort than opening a new bank account at a local bank.

With USD...good luck accomplishing that. Unpaid debts? Garnished. Unpaid taxes? Taken. Divorce? Split. Lawsuits? Frozen. 

I'm not saying BTC should be the solution to these things. In other words, don't be an asshole. I'm saying it's a solution that adds privacy to money in a way that hasn't existed before.

"As I wrote, there are numerous studies showing that most women are simply not interested in STEM fields. Even without any social interaction, it seems to be encoded in us somehow (scientist believe it is linked to testosterone levels which affects how brain is formed). Good example could be Sweden - they tried hard to get to a point where nurses are half-half male-female, yet they failed - most men simply weren't/aren't interested in this line of work. I honestly don't think low number of women in IT has anything to do with discrimination, because at least in US, it seems that any IT company is eager to hire a woman.

No, it's not Google's prerogative, since it's illegal now and for a good reason. No one should be discriminated, period. Legalizing gender and race discrimination sounds terrible. I am glad I don't live in US,  because I would not want to live in such barbaric society where discrimination is being praised. In order to have ""positive"" discrimination, you have to discriminate someone ""negatively"". Why should be white men discriminated? Because they had the misfortune of being born to a white family? How is it different to discriminate black people?

I think Google is still interested in profit and looking good (at least that's what they think they are doing), even at the cost of few worse employees, might be worth it.

I agree that we should strive for equality of opportunity, but never of outcome (socialism) which are those diversity quotas. In my opinion correct approach is to try improve state education, not forcing discrimination. In my country education is paid by the state and best schools are state schools. Not so few state universities are even respected world-wide. While I disagree with some choices in education in my country, I think ""free"" (it's paid from taxes, so everybody is paying for it) education is the best approach to the problem of inequality of opportunities - even poor or more specifically non-rich people can afford put their offspring to study what they want.

But I would never force women to study STEM, just because there is too few women. That's a poor reason. They should study it, because they are interested. It was shown that paying women for finishing a school in hopes they will become employed in that field just doesn't work at all. They go for it for money, when they finish school they simply move to a field they are interested in.

Here is an example of how diversity politics doesn't work - https://medium.com/the-mission/im-an-ex-google-woman-tech-leader-and-i-m-sick-of-our-approach-to-diversity-17008c5fe999.";1;1;False;monnef;dv4380e;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"> You're setting up a straw man about my beliefs

"Most of your points have to do with performance and skill, which could very well be true in regards to actual current numbers and rankings of the most skilled men and women in the field, guys are likely to populate the majority of that list. 

It's worth noting though that the fact that list would be more populated with men is simply a descriptive measure, in which there are many cases of sexism against women in the industry and many other social factors that go into women being less involved and prevalent in the STEM fields. 

So, while sure it might not have any affect on profit, I think there are other intangible benefits to having such a policy for the company that are harder to value, like increased likability for the brand to be supportive of historically disadvantaged groups (women, minorities, etc.). 

Hell, maybe Sergei Bryn and Larry Page's sole motivation is to put historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups in employment positions to better those communities and provide more access to the tech world for these people. Would that not be Google's prerogative as an private employer? Especially when it is in line with generally agreed upon idea that something should be done to help these people on a legal level (affirmative action measures etc). 

So, I would say that perhaps there are a multitude of reasons to hire more women that cannot be easily and directly linked to profits. If behavioural economics has taught us anything it's that people can behave irrationally for many different reasons. If people find Google's methods to be offputting they can work elsewhere or use Bing. As long as they aren't breaking any discrimination laws they can do whatever they like as far as I'm concerned.";1;1;False;whuttheeperson;dv3qth4;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

">You can't defend your beliefs

I'm not trying to. I'm barely even stating them. What I am stating is that your random factoids are not ""proof"". That isn't a belief, it's just an objection that your reasoning is invalid. It isn't an objection that your facts are wrong, or that your conclusion is untrue.

>Which is why when you are given evidence

You aren't giving evidence to support your claims. You're giving random, decontextualized stats that have *multiple possible interpretations*. You can't just short-circuit to your ideologically preferred conclusion; to support your claims you have to show why your preferred interpretation is correct *to the exclusion of other plausible interpretations*.

>evidence contrary to your beliefs

How about you tell me what you think my beliefs are? Because I've barely even mentioned them, and I'm not trying to defend them or to convince you that they are correct. I don't think you know what my beliefs are at all. You're the only one here whose beliefs really are in play here. You believe that women are systematically discriminated against, and you believe that your random factoids should self-evidently and irrefutably justify those beliefs, because you're so invested in them. I'm sorry, but the factoids you've chucked around do not suffice. They have multiple plausible explanations, some that satisfy Occam's razor better than your discrimination theory does.

>you hold onto the beliefs in spite of not having a supporting argument

I don't need to support any argument, because I'm not making positive claims. You are, so you need to. But instead you just dump random thought-terminating cliche data masquerading as ""evidence"". You haven't even begun to support your argument. You can shout ""86.5/13.5"" till you're blue in the face, it still won't amount to convincing evidence *on its own* of discrimination against women. I'm not even saying that there isn't discrimination against women, as you seem so desperately to think I believe.
