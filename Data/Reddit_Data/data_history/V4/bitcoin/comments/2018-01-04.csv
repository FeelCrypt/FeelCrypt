Satoshi Nakamoto mined it and no there is no back door key. Satoshi has no special power or control over Bitcoin. He created it that way so no one is in charge. It's a distributed system. No one can force you to use a different cryptocurrency. We dont know who Satoshi is because (s)he/they never revealed themselves.

"I see this is a fundamental shifting of the goalposts. The factors that fuelled the rise in the value of Bitcoin came from its utility as a currency. Now that its utility as a currency largely disappeared, new arguments are put forward as to why Bitcoin justifies its current price and speculating further. If it's now understood to be a store of value i.e an illiquid commodity with artificial scarcity, do you think this is beneficial for hoarders who wish to see the price rise? I don't .. because it's abandoning the fundamentals that gave Bitcoin its brand image, a decentralised P2P currency. I believe we will soon have an ""Emperor has no clothes"" moment. 

It's a few vested interests that are keeping the price of BTC high .. people that own it. That's rational and understandable .. but market pressure will soon become unbearable. New entrants to the crypto game, of which there are a huge potential pool (think global), have interests in getting in on the ground floor of a rival crypto, and crashing Bitcoin .. and the weakness for Bitcoin is, the barrier to entry is pretty low. Anyone can start a Bitcoin .. the hard part is gaining trust and widespread adoption. Early Bitcoin evangelists did the foot work when they got Bitcoin accepted as a currency in a few places, which let's be honest served as a shield for the majority of its usage - drug transactions.

This is only true if you think cheap transactions has more utility than a secure, censorship-resistant store of value. In which case Bitcoins utility has increased A LOT over the last year. Hash rate has gone up crazily and it has proven resistant to various attacks.

"Yea, everyone is saying this today.  But there were plenty of rises and crashes before that you more than likely would have sold the majority at.  Remember it hit $1000 for a while back in 2013 and then fell to $200-$300 ish?  Or how about when it hit 5K and then tumbled back down to 2/3k.  There are so many ""this is it moments, i want out"" along the way it's really hard to say you would have the courage to ride it all the way through when you were so skeptical about the initial purchase.

Could you have been one of the people that lost their wallets, forgot their keys, or the victim of one of the many hacks/scams (mt gox, cryptsy, bitfinex)?  Would you have got into alt coins and lost/gained that way?

Could you have been one of the folks that actually *used* bitcoin (and contributed to its success)?

It's hard to say what would have happened unless it actually has happened.

"> What software to download to solo farm

If you're talking about using your PC for mining, that's not the route to financial independence.  You'll need to buy specialist dedicated ASIC miners, which are in pretty limited supply.

> Money is not my goal, financial independence is.

It's hard to nail this down as a specific requirement.  Mining is competitive.  You will be one of many people trying to be first to solve the block puzzle.  If you're unlucky, you could try a gazillion times and never be first.  You might be second a gazillion times, but there's no prize for second.  

That's why mining pools exist, to spread any wins across the pool.  You might be in a pool of 10,000 miners, and you might never win, but if any of the other 9,999 does you potentially get a cut.  And if you do win, your reward is shared with the others.  Effectively, you have a greater chance to win, but the prize is smaller.

To have any chance at all of a solo return at all, I would imagine that you need a substantial up-front investment in the order of tens of thousands of dollars, and even then miners are selling out faster than they can be bought currently.  

Top end mining equipment is currently only waitlisted, with none available.  Prices per unit are in the $2-3k range, with power consumption of maybe 1 - 1.5 kW.  I supsect you'd need a few of these to go solo.

But for more informed opinion, you could try the good people at /r/BitcoinMining ";1;1;False;BakersDozen;ds6az8s;9 years ago block 0 was mined. Happy birthday Bitcoin!;7nt9fc;https://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f

"Yeah, according the timestamps, it took Satoshi about 7719 minutes to mine block 1, time which could have been spent mining another 772 blocks or so.

Nobody really knows why Satoshi spent so much time mining the first block, but maybe he hadn't measured his hardware's hashrate and didn't calibrate the difficulty properly. It's also possible that the genesis block's timestamp was fudged.

Actually, several blocks early in the chain took more than a day to mine. For example, block 15 took about 1453 minutes.";3;1;False;PM_ME_A_NUMBER;ds5uigg;9 years ago block 0 was mined.

"I can understand that was always a kind of side-benefit of Bitcoin .. however think about it logically. You are putting forward the argument that BTC is essentially like digital gold, and it's utility has recently shifted from being a currency, to being a rare commodity. I can see that logic, but I can see many holes in it. 

Tell me why you have such high confidence a new BTC will not come along and usurp Bitcoin's place as King? Imagine I invent a machine that creates a new Gold-like element, similar weight, similar lustre, similar weight .. Gold price will surely fall. Alchemists have tried and failed to achieve this, but crypto is different. The protocol is can always be improved upon. It feels like we're in the 1990s internet dotcom boom and you're investing heavily in AOL and Yahoo because of their huge market dominance .. but around the same time, Google was quietly doing its thing and producing a technically superior product, and now Google is up there. In 20 years, some new Google which is barely heard of now might take its place. Maybe Urbit or some other decentralised system?

If you have faith in the protocol, and you plan to hold forever, that's up to you, or do you have a price in mind that you will sell all or half? I actually hold a bunch of cryptos Bitcoin included, but i'm not obsessive nor do I wish to shill it or any other crypto online or anywhere else. It's a private thing for me.

"> Nakamoto, who was laid off twice in the 1990s, according to Mitchell, fell behind on mortgage payments and taxes and their home was foreclosed. That experience, says Nakamoto's oldest daughter, Ilene Mitchell, 26, may have informed her father's attitude toward banks and the government.

"You are putting words into my mouth. I never claimed it recently shifted. It just lost some utility but only periodically and not it's most important one.

I don't think anything will replace it as SoV simply because for a lot of people to store value in a network there has to be a high degree of trust in it. This trust takes time to build up and if anything replaces that function, that new thing will hardly be a good SoV with a lot of trust since it has already been proven that one of these ""artificially"" digital scarce commodities can be replaced entirely. I doubt people will be truly comfortable holding whatever overtakes Bitcoin as a SoV since it will always be in the back of their heads that some new shiny tech could come and replace it easily.

Sure, anything is possible - the world is a chaotic place, I'm not arguing there is 0% chance of Bitcoin becomming all I think it will, that would be silly. I'm just think the likelyhood is high enough that I am comfortable betting on it.

>If you have faith in the protocol, and you plan to hold forever, that's up to you, or do you have a price in mind that you will sell all or half? I actually hold a bunch of cryptos Bitcoin included, but i'm not obsessive nor do I wish to shill it or any other crypto online or anywhere else. It's a private thing for me.

Not sure if you're genuinly curious or just trying to accuse me of shilling. Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'll answer. I have no pricepoints set that I want to sell at, I have a lot of faith in the longevity of Bitcoin and only plan on spending or selling in order to cover expenses (not to have fiat money lying around).";1;0;False;YoungScholar89;ds6nmxx;9 years ago block 0 was mined.

I think you need to do some major research on your own so you can understand how general investing works. You would own a small small small partial share (fraction) of BTC from your investment.

what it really is I dont know, might be tulips for my part
An interesting sidenote:

compared to shares, the potential is unlimited. you can wait out.
the ""gamblers fallacy"" doesnt play out with Bitcoin. it can go to zero, but the whole chain keeps on churning so it goes up
again, inevitably.
Not so with shares, if shares drop 70% they issue more shares (recap) and what you invested goes to zero and is rebased so will never relaunch with the same power you once had. If a share goes to zero it ENDS. that is a big difference

Eh, there is a lot of cult worship in this sub, and also FUD spread by people for their own purposes, so sometimes difficult to have a real discussion here. If you look at it objectively the issues with BTC, e.g. transfer speed, could really limit it as other coins that look to address those issues, like ETH, surge to fill that need. Intrinsically BTC looks to fill a niche as a decentralized currency. Philosophically it certainly meets the decentralized part, but with slow transfer speeds it will never be adopted to the point that it supplants actual dollars in transactions. That’s a real problem when the value currently is tied to speculation and not the intrinsic usability as a currency, which is the actual purpose of BTC. If BTC can’t be used as a currency, which is again limited by slow transfer speeds, then as speculative interest wanes so will the speculative value. That’s an actual threat that as an investor has to be recognized. ;5;2;False;MingusDewfus;ds6ra1l;CEO of Google;7o3l0z;http://i.magaimg.net/img/29b9.jpg

"You seem to misunderstand what the quote is trying to say. 

Bitcoin, the currency, and block chain, the underlying technology, are two different things.

Bitcoin, the currency, cannot be duplicated. You cannot buy 1 BTC and copy/paste it to have more. That's what this quote is referencing. To be able to create a digital thing (in this case, a coin) that cannot be duplicated is a remarkable technological achievement. 

The block chain is the technology that makes this happen, and the code has indeed been forked, modified and deployed as different currencies. But this is not a duplication of Bitcoin.

"Well, music is much simpler (and cheaper) to produce than film.  Piracy helped music industry more because a lot of underground/low-profile musicians could spread theirs in the same way other popular/big-name musicians could, whilst other platforms, such as radio and TV, made exclusive deals with bigger studios and drove smaller ones out.  

Movie industry is a bit different, because the cost to produce a film is enourmous and cannot be funded by a single person/small group that effectively.  There really aren't any home-made movies or animations that held popularity.  All successful films were produced by an established company.  

Now, with technology improving, and editing/producing becomes easier, movies might take the same path as music (in fact, I'm working on a project that will help making animations an automated process, might see market in few years if I'm good enough).  However, as it stands, in my opinion, piracy doesn't really help movie industry in terms of profit, which is the only thing that really matters to them.";6;1;False;lunatickid;ds75rz5;CEO of Google;7o3l0z;http://i.magaimg.net/img/29b9.jpg

"**Bloomberg Terminal**

The Bloomberg Terminal is a computer software system provided by the financial data vendor Bloomberg L.P. that enables professionals in the financial service sector and other industries to access the Bloomberg Professional service through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial market data and place trades on the electronic trading platform. The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network. It is well-known among the financial community for its black interface, which is not optimized for user experience but has become a recognizable trait of the service.

Most large financial firms have subscriptions to the Bloomberg Professional service.

"I... just... oh well. Let's dive in, for the sake of anyone reading.

1. Aren't you confusing the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) with the TV/website news outlet? Because while they share a name these are not even remotely comparable, apples vs. tanks so to speak.

    Bloomberg Terminal = state of the art trading platform (hardware). Used throughout the industry by pro traders. The very existence of this category is why ""trading floors"" are a thing of the past except as a background for TV (layman shows).

    Bloomberg News (TV, website) = IGN for trading. Pros (and many amateurs) now better than to follow opinion pieces, it's much too shallow to amount to anything except breaking news (which are largely anticipated by pros).

2. Trading floor: largely for show nowadays. Traders work in offices. Computerization etc. Latency matters. A desk is better to analyze stuff. Paper is gone. No one shouts ""buy"" ""sell"" anymore.

3. You third paragraph is accurate. Don't forget Goldman Sachs too, reports are their bread and butter for major clients, up to governments and trade unions. TV pays a bit to get excerpts and general ideas, though vastly editorialized for the mainstream (i.e. opinion-driven as part of their image). It's like most major news outlets as we speak: you don't get ""accurate"" or ""neutral"" information, you just get a bit of emotion-spiking content to justify ad space.

     I'll say it again because your second paragraph is weirdly contradicting the third: media analysis is **not comparable** to professional reports by financial institutions. The financial media, just like any media these days, is just about click-n-bait and FOMO/FUD'ing and whatever brings audience to sell ads. It takes reading, books and reports (not articles and news anchors) to educate oneself about anything, and finance is no exception.

Hopefully the rise of cryptocurrencies will work in conjunction with the rise of alternative/new media aimed at informing the public (currently it's more like the opposite, driven by the worst instincts of human nature from the web to Youtube passing by nonsensical books and ""experts"". It's a dire time for quality information in this sea of emotions, the signal/noise ratio is as low as it was before the printing press).";-1;2;False;ikkei;ds6cj39;Bitcoin now shown on CNBC as a currency;7nw573;https://i.redd.it/y977u9s01w701.png

I kept clicking on every link because I know how websites work. They kept writing more and more articles. Now crypto is a major part of their reporting.";0;0;False;throwawayTooFit;ds6kvo9;Bitcoin now shown on CNBC as a currency;7nw573;https://i.redd.it/y977u9s01w701.png

I watched 2 people trash BCH on CNBC last week. They said it was basically centralized while Bitcoin isn't. I mean that's totally wrong, but my point is they said it.;2;0;False;R_O_F_L;ds60wbw;Bitcoin now shown on CNBC as a currency;7nw573;https://i.redd.it/y977u9s01w701.png
"#1. The U.S. Treasury says: ""The U.S. Treasury classified Bitcoin as a ""Convertible Decentralized Virtual Currency"" in 2013.[28] The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, classified Bitcoin as a Commodity in September 2015. Per IRS, Bitcoin is taxed as a property.[29] In September 2016, a federal judge ruled that ""Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term"".

#2. In the USA, The Magistrate Judge stated, “[i]t is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shaver's stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.”[47] This decision paved the way for other regulators to treat Bitcoin and VCs as money, so it is likely this decision will be cited if regulators decide to prosecute VC transactions under the UIGEA, Illegal Gambling Business Act, Wire Act, or any other regulation involving financial transactions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency_law_in_the_United_States#Securities_fraud";2;1;False;tw_bass;ds611t3;Bitcoin now shown on CNBC as a currency;7nw573;https://i.redd.it/y977u9s01w701.png
