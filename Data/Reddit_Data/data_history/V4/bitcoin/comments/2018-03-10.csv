Everyone seems to forget that before Blockstream came along, Rover Ver was a Bitcoin hero.  He made a lot of money off BTC and evangelized it every chance he got.  There's a reason he got the nickname ""Bitcoin Jesus.""

But Bitcoin went in a direction that Ver did not like.  He went his own separate way.  That happens.  We live in a capitalist free market, not a dictatorship.

"> Seriously, their methods for trying to grow are f**ed! I could look past the logo being almost identical if it ended there, but everything coming out of the ~~BCash~~ Bitcoin Cash community tells me they're hell bent on stealing the legacy of bitcoin at any means necessary, rather than just focusing on making a excellent product.

I think they take things a bit too far when it comes to propaganda sometimes.  Do I think Bitcoin Cash is closer to the Whitepaper?  Yes.  Do I think Lightning is a complicated disaster?  Yes.  But I think the BCH side of things needs to focus on improving the product and not hijacking the brand.  Instead of constantly saying ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin"" it would be much better if they said something like ""Bitcoin Cash - Taking Bitcoin Back To It's Roots"" or ""Bitcoin Cash - On Chain Scaling and Retail Adoption.""

Bitcoin's recognition as a brand name is huge.  Hijacking that will just never work.  Focus on technical superiority.  Admit you're a fork of the original product with a different mission from Bitcoin and move on with your day.

I get where Ver is coming from.  He spent a LOT of time evangelizing the Bitcoin brand.  And he wanted it to take over the world.  He wanted adoption in third world countries, and small mom and pop businesses to be able to do transactions off their phone without a bank.

At some point that vision was lost by the core developers.  The fee problem was outsourced to Lightning, rather than fixed by Core and rhetoric started about Bitcoin being a ""store of value"" and not a day to day currency.

His dreams were crushed when Segwit 2X failed and he moved to the on chain scaling solution that he wanted.

Which he's allowed to do.  But coincidentally, he happened to own bitcoin.com and the @bitcoin twitter account.  Roger Ver was Bitcoin's biggest fan at one time.

I think, to the people that scream ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin,"" Bitcoin is more an idea than a product.  And I get that argument, but I disagree with it.

I fully expect Lightning to be a huge hot mess.  But at the same time I really hope it isn't.

"Wow all these responses don't actually answer the question. Now I'm not the most knowledgeable person here, but apparently I'm the least biased. 

Last year there was a fork of the Bitcoin code & *network. I believe it all started with a debate about how to scale Bitcoin to handle more users/transactions. 

What is now BCH (usually called Bitcoin Cash) is the fork that implements adjustable block sizes (fitting more transactions in a block is the idea). Supporters of BCH attempt to just call it Bitcoin because they believe it is closer to the ""vision"" laid out by the whitepaper. The company pushing BCH the most is BitMain, a company that sells ASICs for mining. Their hardware uses has a patented tech called ASICBoost.  Reddit discussion for BCH is mainly found at r\btc.

BTC (Bitcoin) is the other part of the fork (I believe BTC is technically a continuation of the original). It implements SegWit (segregated witness) which changes what data is stored in a block. This change gets rid of (fixes) transaction malleability, which makes ASICBoost no longer work. SegWir also increases the number of transactions that can fit in a block. ~~SegWit is also needed (?) for Lighting Network.~~ *Not having to deal with transaction malleability makes implementing Lightning Network easier/simpler. Lightning Network is a 2nd layer solution for scaling. The idea is that most transactions (especially ones between parties that move money frequently) are handled by channels between users and are not directly on the blockchain. The net of all those transactions show up on the blockchain when the channel is eventually closed. BTC is supported heavily by BlockStream. Reddit discussion for BTC is mainly found here, at r\bitcoin.

I live in the middle of greenhouse country, but it's not yet year round because of the prohibitive cost of heating during the coldest 2-3 months of winter.

"10 years working in horticulture. Most work experience is related to organic food production. I also have experience with nursery and greenhouse production, bulk propagation, hydroponics/aquaponics, landscaping, irrigation, as well as taking care of farm animals and bees. I’ve worked on small organic family farms, medium sized commercial organic crop producers, and have experienced large scale organic operations through field studies. I helped establish an organic farm plot at a community college, and was one of the first official employees (there was only 3 of us). I consulted for beginning farmers, helping establish multiple low key medical cannabis operations in California (indoor and outdoor, conventional and organic methods), and have helped conventional growers transition to organic. I’m currently working with a permaculture farm that grows food for a cafe, and hosts outdoor learning opportunities for children. I’m designing and planting a long term “food forest” project for them.

Horticulture is also a hobby of mine. At home, I grow a lot of my own food. I also like integrating electronics projects with garden projects. I’m currently working on a fun little project that involves a sensor network talking to a main brain that is monitoring the garden. For high value crops, like cannabis, you can justify spending more money to grow a better crop. Even with that in mind, the cost for stuff like this is getting cheaper all the time. $1.50 gets you a wireless micro controller that connects to sensors. The micro controller relays the data to a computer (could be as cheap as a piZero), where it is stored in a database. I’m planning to develop a nice interface for the main computer (touchscreen in the garden shed), along with a web interface (local wifi) for smartphone/tablet. I would also like to apply concepts of deep learning to the data. I can envision being able to make a predictive model for tasks like watering, one day. Also, making my own site-specific almanac would be cool";1;0;False;chabes;dvhp1yp;Who would imagine that mining cryptocurrencies and agriculture can work together?
