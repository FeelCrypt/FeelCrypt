"I think the problem is 2-fold:

* Reddit is thus far an inherently centralized service; even when abuse occurs, there's no obvious way to route around it.

* Reddit's model for a system that collates and curates discussion is fundamentally flawed; it does not impose the necessary logical structure to yield the desired outcome of high quality information sharing.";15;1;False;well_did_you;d4bxbvg;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"To be honest I'm having a hard time understanding why the price is increasing. I own bitcoin happily and of course don't mind the price increase, but since 2013 we've seen huge leaps in underlying infrastructure improvements and stable, reliable service providers, as well as mainstream acknowledgement and interesting research, yet the price did poorly and is still down from its high.

A steady rise since lows of 2014 would've made sense to me. A pump prior to a halving seems just that, a pump. Or a correction, I'm hoping for the second, but I don't see any indication of a totally new market demand that finally came to its senses.

"Let it stay under the radar until it becomes too expensive to ""lock in"". All of a sudden it will explode in popularity and everyone will be insulted that they didn't know about it before you could reasonably own a single bitcoin.

Then use your knowledge of how the market will react, and play the price waves accordingly. If you're smart, experienced and level headed with bitcoin investments, you'll make a lot of money off of public ignorance. I call it a ""dumb tax"".

I hate to say it, but we do our homework so we deserve the early entry and cheap prices. We worked hard to grow the community and learn about this groundbreaking technology. If popular opinion isn't in favor of bitcoin before the price skyrockets, then popular opinion won't profit from bitcoin.
