Not with that attitude.

They only way they have power is if it is given to them.  All your decisions about who and what you invest your resources in are feeding something.  What are you feeding?

I don't pay taxes for the most part.  And haven't for about a decade.  Legally.  I haven't worked for a company that harms anyone in a very long time.  And I haven't voted for any politician that I don't fully support.  And whenever possible I use my resources to invest in the most creative and productive and compassionate organizations and companies I can find.  I'm not perfect, but if I can mostly not support the projects and programs that I find dangerous, then so can you.  It's just a decision you make.

"Nothing you wouldn't expect. I worked on translating and transcribing intercepted and confiscated intelligence. The intel community is highly compartmentalized, and there is little I am comfortable divulging, as the NDA's were quite robust. I can say I had a TSCIC, a NSA net clearance and one roof server access and none of the systems I worked with seemed beyond current consumer tech. Our intercept capabilities are what I'd call feast or famine, we mostly relied on people fucking up (not understanding our intercept abilities) and carelessness (non secure voice communication) or just literally leaving video/text/voice laying that we gather during field ops. I will readily admit that due to compartmentalization I often had no idea the source of what I was analyzing, so it is plausible that some of our intercept capabilities were greater than I had knowledge of.

"Lol, no. If they did, why is it that not a single security researcher in the history of the world has managed to catch them doing it? Despite armies of people decompiling Android APKs and iOS IPAs and intercepting these apps' network traffic, nobody has ever produced a single shred of evidence that they're sending audio recordings back to base.

Do you even have any idea how much data it would consume if your phone were recording you all fucking day and sending it to some distant server? A day's worth of audio recorded at even 64kbit per second - a pretty shitty quality that would be almost impossible to automatically transcribe - is still roughly 700 mb *per day*. How on earth do you think it would be possible to hide that sort of data usage from the consumer? 

Nothing about an app you run on your local device is hidden from view, every single aspect of it can be dissected and observed, and yet nobody has ever observed the behaviour you're talking about.

Here's an example of what I mean. Lets say that out of 100 start up companies 90 of them do the right thing and resist unconstitutional government orders, and 10 of them comply. Then the government financially ruins those 90 companies, leaving only the 10 that complied, which go on to be popular and successful businesses. As the public we would only ever know about those 10 that survived, which would make it seem like everyone is cowardly, when actually most companies did the right thing at the cost of their existence.

"You don't need other people to investigate, simple mathematics should tell you what you're proposing is impossible. 

For instance, recording video isn't free, it requires energy to run the camera, energy to run the SoC which receives the camera information, energy to write that information to disk or to RAM, energy to connect to the cell network or wifi network to transmit, and so on - if your phone was doing all of this stuff 24/7 your battery would last maybe three or four hours at *best*, and that's assuming you didn't use your phone to do anything else while it was recording.

Or how about the storage and processing requirements to make use of all that data? As of April 2014 there were a total 327,577,529 mobile phones in active use in America - that's more than the population of the whole country, by the way.

If we were ultra-conservative and said that each phone only recorded one single hour of ridiculously low quality video (say 320p) each day and sent it to the NSA, that's still 144 MB * 327,577,529 phones = 47,171,164,176 MB - that's ***forty-seven thousand terabytes of data every single day*** that the NSA would have to store!

"Excitable and dickish.

But ok let's think together.

Let's say to an advertiser only the top 1 percent are worth it rather than every single person.  Let's say of 100mm households that makes 1 million interesting potential targets.  

Let's say advertisers are less interested in the 12 hours of sleep and shower time and would find your 24 hour spec wasteful and a little stupid.    Let's say with a little testing you could narrow hours of interest down to 1 a day.  That's more time than I talk to my spouse typically.  Alternately scientific American says the average American speaks 16,000 words per day.  Conversation speaking speed is maybe 125 words per minute which gives you a total of 2 hours of speaking in a 24 hr period.  Let's stick with an hour, so you now have 24 million hours to deal with in a day.


With better targeting you could do a lot better than that.
Say you only record after the word ""want"" or ""love"" or ""need""or""god willing""

Several sites I see say you can get 17,000 hours of music on a tb.  Probably that is high quality vs a single voice.  Not sure why you seem to be much lower. Anyway to make it easy let's call it 24,000 hours of voice.  So you need 1,000 tb to store a day, which would cost $30,000 or so at retail.  Probably you could discard it all every couple days, convert to text, or otherwise simplify.

Alternatively there's a four year old gizmodo article suggesting 1,000 tb could be stored in a DVD sized device.  Not sure how that panned out.  Either way it seems likely you could achieve the storage partfor the price of a shitty car in a device no bigger than what you could shove up your ass.

What'd I get wrong?

"It's a good start, but doesn't it concern you that you have to jump through so many hoops to make the numbers realistic? Constructing an imaginary scenario in which the numbers work isn't the difficulty, it's constructing an imaginary scenario that has any realistic, real-world value which still results in numbers that work. 

For instance, when you're talking about only recording *after* certain words are spoken: how do you identify when those words are spoken without recording it in the first place?

When you say people speak for a total of two hours over the course of a day, do you see why that complicates your proposed one hour recording? How do you identify when to do your one hour of recording when the information you're after is spread so thinly? 

Oh also, don't forget you also have to invent some kind of new magical technology that makes it impossible for any 16 year old with a packet sniffer to detect that you're doing all of this stuff.

You also have to ensure that not one of the tens of thousands of employees in your company ever decides to grow a moral backbone and tell the press what you're doing, since not only are you breaking the law, you're also running the risk of destroying your brand reputation.

There are so many holes in your conspiracy theory, I don't think you're going to be able to patch them all, and even if you managed it you still have reality to contend with - nobody has *ever* identified this behaviour actually happening in the wild.

"I don't think it is jumping hoops at all, i think targeting and analytics is the basics of any business or endeavor, and the targeting I have was simple.  THere are many more sophisticated cuts.

Most of your points are easy, if I am an advertiser I could test and pick which hours of the day to listen and the total speaking time being low narrows it further.  My two hours of talking time versus one chosen in my example is not a conflict as you somewhat condescendingly point out; it was a simple reality check on the assumption.  Double it and you had two shitty cars and two asses needed to hold the data if you like 

I don't know whether a loop as in a dashcam that would be only activated to save or record the previous two minutes when signaled would be energy efficient. My phone though has 21 hrs of talk time of which I assume a substantial portion of the energy used is to reach the tower.

This nyt article from this week is slightly interesting in that it shows Alexa records and retains at least all direct interactions

"I wasn't talking about Shor's. I was talking about Grover's.

Key space increase to RSA increase the number of Qubits required for the computation. Making it impossible for Shor's to be run in the foreseeable future in practice. (Again, we'd need serious chops for someone to verify that increased key size, increases the *minimum* number of qubits)

That being said, RSA is I believe used to key exchanges in the current model, which would have a quantum replacement at that point (Again we'd need someone with serious chops to speculate.)

So replace RSA for the key exchange with a secure key exchange, use AES for the data encryption and you should still have a search space of 2^128 (assuming the current standard of AES256).

But, I think the minimum required number of gates for 128 bit AES are less than that of 2048 Bit RSA, making 128 Bit AES vulnerable, before RSA.

"Right. He's saying it would set a dangerous precedent, which is why they didn't do it.

In the very next paragraph,

>**Far from backing down from the fight**, Mr. Cook has told colleagues that he still stands by the company’s longstanding plans to encrypt everything stored on Apple’s myriad devices, services and in the cloud, where the bulk of data is still stored unencrypted.

>**“If you place any value on civil liberties, you don’t do what law enforcement is asking,”** Mr. Cook has said.

Not that it's worth much, since I can't prove this to you in any meaningful way without revealing a shitload of personal info, but I have a family friend who's one of Apple's government liaisons and I can tell you that Apple's stance on security is not a charade. They genuinely have no interest whatsoever in helping the government acquire the capability to unlock iPhones and are actively doing everything possible to make sure doing so is impossible (even for Apple). Their ideal scenario is one where the government comes to them asking to unlock a phone and they can honestly reply ""we literally can't"".

The government really didn't have any meaningful way to force Apple to comply in the short term, since Apple has effectively unlimited resources to fight them in court and can't be bullied through the threat of litigation like individuals/smaller companies can. If the FBI had wanted to force them to comply, they would have had to get their court order upheld in court through the full appeals process.

There's no reason to believe Apple helped them, simply because there was no real reason for Apple to have done so.

Ensure they do so in such a way that it causes the collapse of the sky scraper that was specifically designed to withstand such an impact. Twice.

"Throttle, transmission, and ignition are by-wire with a computer interface an no mechanical or even independent electrical connection not interfaced by a computer.  

Electrical power steering is increasingly controlled by a computer.  Some have variable-effort: the effort of the steering is controlled by a computer.  In these mechanically-linked, variable gear systems, you can only reduce power assist so that the car is difficult to steer.  It *may* be possible to influence steering by providing 'negative-feedback' or pulses of weird assist power to confuse the driver and make the care difficult/impossible to control.  You might do this in conjunction with other inputs like crazy throttle and brake pulses on various wheels.  I.e. you could heavily brake the left front wheel, and power assist to the left rapidly, causing the car to veer left, then lock the rear wheels in a few hundred milliseconds and initiate an uncontrolled spin.  

*Some* systems from Audi and Lexus have no 'real' mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and rack.  There is a 'variable gear' of some type which depends on an electrical motor to engage in a variable way.  It seems possible to actually control the steering on these.  

Now, are these systems able to be influenced from a single or 'workable' multiple points of entry?  Do their OSs have enough variability to be controlled outside of some safety parameters, or even passive safety just given nominal specifications?  Is the network robust enough to carry variables outside of normal 'bandwidth'?  

These are technical problems that would be highly specific to each model of auto.  However, with the resources of a nation-state behind the effort, I see no reason that these cars can't be brought into an uncontrollable situation, *theoretically*.  

If the technology continues apace, without more conservative regulation, I see no reason why a car won't be vulnerable to complete remote control at some point in the near future, *theoretically*.  There is a lot more to 'hacking' than just cracking a code or accessing a comm point of some type.  There are built in limitations due to cost and complexity, regardless of whether the engineers or safety regulators mean to prevent some type of 'hacking'.  

The question then becomes, given the increase of automatic safety features like adaptive braking and lane-change control, and the incipient self-driving mode already featured, and the big efforts by GM and John Deere to 'take control' of the operating software, do automobile manufacturers present a target like we've seen with the Google, FB, MS backdoors?  

The answer has to be yes.  If it is not yes, then our intelligence agencies are incompetent and committing an oversight based on their objectives.  

I'm not saying it's good.  I think this is a firm negative, something I don't usually commit to on reddit.  There should be no way for a manufacturer or government or any entity to control an automobile outside of a normal human's capacity to mechanically control an automobile at base 1969-level (as an example of a mechanical car).

It's one thing to say that it exists or that it's possible, it's another to know that your intelligence community is researching it and KEEPING IT SECRET.  That's the key, these exploits they are aware of , they are PURPOSELY keeping them secret to utilize them.  Why would the CIA ever need to have secret backdoors to hack someones vehicle?  We both know the answer to that, but you can't get people to believe this stuff unless there's actual evidence of it.
