What's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up what's UP, BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEECT Hey hey hey everybody, My name is Carlos Matos and I am coming from New York City, New York Let me tell you guys that I am SO EXCITED, I am SO HAPPY I am really so thrilled to be right now, Sharing this amazing, glorious, SUPER and EXCITING moment of my life with all of you guys -and let me tell you that we are really changing the WORLD as we know it The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be mmh mmh NO NO NOH.

BitcoNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT WOOOoo bitconnEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT

We are coming and we are coming in waves We are starting and to actually go all over the world We all built in the entire world Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago, with only 25 thousand six hundred and ten dollars -and right now I am reaching one hundred and forty THOUSAND dollars

WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WHAT'S UP

And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- I mean around one thousand four hundred dollars on an everyday basis seven days a week WHAT?!!?

I am right now independently, financially independently, I am saying to so many people who say that this is going to be a con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game: “Hey, you are gonna lose all your mone-” My WIFE still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling her “Well honey this is real” “No no no no no no, that’s a scam!” And I say “But wait I’m gonna go to the banks, I’m gonna get my bitcoins, I’m gonna actually put it into dollars, here they are right on the table!” “Aww, that’s money that you took from one of the accounts!” I say: “What am I gonna do?” Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I started to put ten thousand dollars a day on her, right on her, y’know on her table” Then she’s gonna say: “WOOOOW.” HA-HA-HA-HA-h. “YEAYEYEYEYEYE OK, THAT’S REAL” HAHAHAHAH

So guys, I wanna tell you something: Faith and belief is the one thing we will need to be able to change the world. And right now, I believe, that in this room, we have the seed, that’s gonna germinate, and that is going to EXPLODE, into an AMMMAZING opportunity for us to change this entire world.

I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so EXCITED to be here right now- And hey let me tell you something, that each and every one of YOU, has the opportunity to become, like those amazing people that we know here FROM VIET NAM! HEY HEY, MY PRPL(indistinguishable)-VIET NAM, making so much money that they can probably have a real hard time counting it!

Not really. See for example it's the same as having videos of people riding bikes, or racing, or flying a hang glider, or playing a really scary game. Experiencing someone getting terrified is a joy in itself, or maybe the player is skilled, then it's like watching a sport. In fact, there's a whole industry created for it, EA Sports (granted it's limited and its not everyone's thing, it exists), and there's future potential for games. But then there's maybe something about the person someone's watching and less about the game. When I watch streams I am there for the Character of the streamer. Usually someone with strong moral views and professional quality content. It's more enjoyable than any big name TV series in that respect. Some people take it to the next level by donating, in some case thousands of dollars because they really enjoy that person and what they do.
