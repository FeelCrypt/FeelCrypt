">Funds based on derivatives are like a bunch of people getting together and betting on the BTC price without actually buying/selling any BTC. They're therefore somewhat separate from the real market, though they still affect each other.

If there is any meaningful price divergence between the future and the BTC itself, hedge funds can profit by arbitraging that difference towards zero, ensuring that any price move in the BTC future has a direct and equal magnitude impact on the price of BTC.

"> Wait, hang on... those are literally the things that money can buy. If you have money, then you don't have to work as much and you will be able to do all of these things. And to explore the world?... literally, it takes money to do this

When I was in college, I went to Japan on a study abroad, and decided to not come back for a year.  I had no money.  I couldn't visit any of the sites outside of what was in my own region.  I stayed in the cheapest of places.  I would take the train into Osaka  to buy comics to resell on ebay to get money to eat.

I still think this was the best trip I have ever taken.  

Now that I'm about a dozen years older, I have traveled since then, with a fair bit more money to my name.  I've seen the sights.  I've stayed in nice places.  

But you end up in your own little world.  A hotel bar with a bunch of other foreigners is a very different place than the small red lantern tavern that you and the salary men would go to, because it was the cheapest place in your little neighborhood to grab a beer. 

Struggle is like spice:  some people don't like it, other people prefer to pile it on so much you can't taste anything else.  

You're right, it took money to get to Japan.  Money gave be the opportunity to get there.  But once I was there, it prevented me from not having a worse experience, but a _different_ one.  

And now that I'm older, I miss taking the train into Osaka, to buy comics, to resell on ebay to get money to eat...";2;0;False;thekiyote;dqsumar;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

I felt a mixture of happyness (I had made what I thought at the time was a lot of money)... and also a weird hatred of Bitcoin. I wanted people to know that I had made the right choice, and Bitcoin would be crushed by Governments and regulation. 

A few months later I panic bought back a few as it looked like I was wrong. Rode it up to $1100... then rode a horrendous crash back down to sub $500 I think (probably lower). 
2 years of forgetting about it, and watching my coins lose value. Then this rally started. 

I guess I do feel regret for selling... but you seriously have to have strong hands to hold for years. I could have been a multimillionaire... but my psychology didn't let me. How people who are not already wealthy have held significant sums of coins until today is beyond me.

"I honestly get what you're saying, but that's still incorrect imo. Why would you not be able to enjoy life as a young man with hundreds of millions in liquid cash? That literally makes no sense. If I had bought BTC when I first heard of it, instead of blowing $3k on parties and shit, I would now, still be in my mid twenties, with approximately $300 million in my bank account. For me, life is about becoming better, at everything. I can enjoy the ride, and make shitloads of money at the same time. 
For me, it's quite simple.  Money is inherently worthless, but money = time, and time = the most valuable commodity in the universe. 

If I had $100m right now, I'd simply stop working. I would become better at something else. Like, eating pussy. My fiance, if honest, could probably give me a few pointers, but right now, I don't have the fucking time to become a master at eating snatch.

There are two type sof peopme who buy bitcoin.

One who buys thinkin it is going to go up to a certain point nsd they should sell. They will never getthe full value and likely will always sell for a small multiple of fheir initial investment.

The other type is the type that just buys and holds and absolutely never thinks about when they should sell. They realize bitcoin IS the ultimate repository. They only sell a small amount to buy what they need for their life.  These are the ones who get rich.

"This is the post I was looking for. Given outsized gains on an initial investment, it's nothing but human nature to take some (or all) the profits and run for relative safety. This isn't wrong thinking, it's hardwired into everything humans do with risk taking. An early ENRON investor ""could have"" made outsized gains and subsequently outsized losses.


We are simply not wired to allow winnings to multiply 100 fold, and  for the most part this instinct saves a lot of people from making poor decisions. It does also lead an order of magnitude fewer people into taking profits too early.

"Look, no offense, but you also have a problem. And the problem emerged sooner in your life I bet.

I remember my dad dying with your words. He was complaining that the blueberry cake is not as good as it used to be etc.

I am also in my 40s, I made a fortune too, but I honestly do not have those problems. I bought a fast car now and it brings me fun. More than the 1st crappy car when I was horrible driver and had many accidents, driving drunk etc.

I travel a lot (I actually moved in the opposite of the world), not with budget 100 USD/month. I still have a lot of danger and fun, but in the end I can decide whether I sleep in 5 star hotel or some rotten place as before.

I have learnt how to love animals and I have nice cats.

I finally have some people around that are important to me and they are not dicks (yeah, they are not dicks, because they work for me, so I kicked out all dicks).

I have my x-th wife, finally real submissive slut, who loves me and I can love her.

I still do some psychedelics, I started with body exercise etc.

The list goes on, not going to jerk off in public.

But my point is that the same things you felt in 20s are possible in later age and maybe even brighter. You just have to work on it. Do not be scared to do painful changes in life. Maybe it is true one loses energy bit by bit, but at the same time the experience levels this off and you should be able to manage the energy better.

If you are not doing the energy-management, because you probably thought the things should be automatic like in 20s, you do something horribly wrong.

It is the same btw. as with meals. I always had 70 kg something with 185cm. I did not have to look what I do or what I eat. If I stop now I will be 100kg in no time. But now I know how. I know what is a good food and how to get it. I can buy it in civilized world at least. I know how to do exercise efficiently. And so on and so on. Working on soul is in this way the same as working on body. I think it is never late for you. But who knows. Maybe you already missed your train as well if there is a thing like missing trains.

Good luck, my suggestion is at least try it.

edit: I read your other posts, yeah, you crossed some line inb4, you gotta have balls now, because you took a loan with high interest and it is not about money if you get what i mean; otherwise very good posts for others, but they will not listen mostly... the experience can not be passed over";2;3;False;Middle0fNowhere;dqsgl4q;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

While that guy is amazing, the issue here is not a lack of opportunity, or overcoming odds. It is regret over a lost opportunity. Opportunity will almost certainly breed regret, because we can't always be right when we make these choices. The best you can do is make choices that feel right at the time, and when we look back be happy with the hand we played (right or wrong). If we are constantly trying to improve our circumstances, we will constantly create more opportunity, and ultimately, this will create more regret. As I have moved forward in life (particularly financially) I have noticed the financial mistakes of missed opportunity get bigger and bigger. This is partly because I am create more and more opportunity, and the multipliers get bigger. Bitcoin skyrocketing (exactly as predicted) doesn't help lessen regret, so I'm always simultaneously happy and sad that it is going to the moon. Dealing with regret is hard. It is a first world problem (in the financial sense) but we all have regrets we need to deal with. Some are more acute than others unfortunately, due to time, and clarity of the alternate outcomes. I have also had depression induced from regret, and bitcoin induced regret (fortunately not bitcoin induced depression). I don't have many solutions, but it is important to recognise there are many other opportunities (potentially more risky unfortunately - but hey, look at Monero :). The opportunity has gone, and you have to let it go - it is most likely you wanted the money for the time it would afford you. Living that time with anguish is only adding to the loss, so meditate and grieve it, but let it go. Talk about it with others if you can, even write stuff out - hell this comment is pretty therapeutic. Visualising the other alternative futures can help too - what if Bitcoin tanked when Segwit 2x with bugs was released? You would have felt like a champion - and it did have bugs. Black Swans happen, none of this is guaranteed. Live life in the moment, and practice gratitude for what you have.;12;2;False;homoredditus;dqsezki;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"**Seven deadly sins**

The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).

"**Ronald Wayne**

Ronald Gerald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is an American retired electronics industry worker. He co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, providing administrative oversight for the new venture. He soon, however, sold his share of the new company for $800 US dollars, and later accepted $1,500 to forfeit any claims against Apple (in total, equivalent to $9,296 in 2016). As of March 2017, if Wayne had kept his 10% stake in Apple Inc., it would have been worth over $75.5 billion.

**The Method of Mechanical Theorems**

The Method of Mechanical Theorems (Greek: Περὶ μηχανικῶν θεωρημάτων πρὸς Ἐρατοσθένη ἔφοδος), also referred to as The Method, is considered one of the major surviving works of the ancient Greek polymath Archimedes. The Method takes the form of a letter from Archimedes to Eratosthenes, the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria, and contains the first attested explicit use of indivisibles (sometimes referred to as infinitesimals). The work was originally thought to be lost, but in 1906 was rediscovered in the celebrated Archimedes Palimpsest. The palimpsest includes Archimedes' account of the ""mechanical method"", so-called because it relies on the law of the lever, which was first demonstrated by Archimedes, and of the center of mass (or centroid), which he had found for many special shapes.

"I remember reading a story of a guy who had thousands of coins on a laptop he threw away, and he went to the land fill to try to find it. I think it was around when it hit 1000 bucks. the value of the coins was enough that like the total mass of the landfill was thousands of times more valuable than any sort of mine.

I too threw away a hard drive with a few coins I had bought for like 10 bucks a piece. Could have been a new car. I also spent my very first paycheck on Google stock, I was able to afford 2 shares, they we're somewhere around 100  bucks and I got them from.... No fucking clue haha. Some stock selling place that had commercials. Ameritrade or something, maybe the one whose logo is green. Anyways I think they have split their stock 2 times since then, that would have been a sweet chunk of cash too.

When I was like 7 years old though, I wanted to start a coin collection. At a swap meet I bought Morgan silver dollars for 2 dollars each! I'd get 5 bucks a week and would buy at least one, and then whatever random other coins too. Several have been worth close to a thousand bucks. Most are damaged and junky just worth their value in silver, some were so worn the guy weighed them and they were like 20% less than an ounce.

Exactly.  The other thing to realize.. Is if he had 10,000 btc, in all likelihood he would have sold at $1million.  Most did the same.  100 or 1000x gains are rare and it would have been a solid trade.

"Yup.  My son played on a baseball team with another kid and for our end of year party he was hosting, so we go over and they are loaded, huge house it was freaking insane.   Now, next season, suddenly all the parents are cheering for him (you can tell they are over cheering) and so are the kids.  Boom kid strikes out and I hear sooo many (that's okay, you'll get them next time).  Even my son was like treating him differently because he's got the coolest toys and biggest house and stuff.   

Well, I grew up poor and I can sniff out that ""wealth privilege"" treatment.   It is insane how people treat you differently when you are wealthy.  In some jacked up way, if I was wealthy, I'd try to help others be wealthy, so they wouldn't treat me different, we'd be on the same level.  That's why I think some rich people get along with rich people, because they are at the same level.  When you are both rich, that ""wealth privilege"" is cancelled out.  Same thing when you are poor.  But what bothers me the most, in both cases, how we treat people is based on how much money we have.  

So when you have none, it's easy for everyone to see who you really are.   But, being poor then being rich is easier than being rich and then becoming poor.  And so when this guy's brother went from the potential of being poor to really rich and then back down to poor, psychologically it's a hard fall.  Like I said, I've been broke and I've survived the bottom level and that type of confidence and experience is priceless.

"According to [this report](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/09/17/kim-nilsson-of-wizsec-how-the-bitcoins-were-stolen-from-mt-gox/), here's what happened to all the bitcoin:

Here is the list of disasters, and a timeline:





2010 - Jed McCaleb founded Gox  
January 2011 - **$50K stolen** via Liberty Reserve withdrawal exploit  
January 2011 - negative withdrawals exploit.  User ""withdrew"" minus $2M.  Possibly fixed without permanent damage.  
March 2011 - Hot wallet stolen (copied from server).  **80K BTC lost**  Coins haven't moved.   
March 2011 - Sold to Karpeles (already insolvent)    
May 2011 - Off-site wallet stolen.  **300K BTC lost.** Thief returned for 1% finders fee (discovering hot wallet on an unsecured network drive.  
June 2011 - Hacker got into Jed's admin account, crashed market and stole **2000 BTC**.  
August 2011 - Gox absorbed Bitomat, absorbing **17,000 BTC** debt  
Sept 2011 - database compromised **77,500 BTC stolen**  
Sept - Oct 2011 - Thief got copy of main wallet.dat.  Stole over **630,000 BTC** from Oct 1 2011 through the end.  
Oct 2011 - Change address of stolen wallet is incorrectly interpreted as customer deposits, accounting for 48 lucky Gox users getting **44,300 BTC** in false deposit credits.  About 30,000 ultimately remained lost.   
Oct 2011 - a bug in the new wallet software caused Gox to send **2609 BTC** to unspendable addresses.  
May 2013 - US Gov siezes **$5M in funds**   
May 2013 - CoinLabs dispute costs **$5M**  
2011-2013 - Willy Bot ""obligation exchange"" made losses worse by **$51.6M and 22,800 BTC**  
**Total losses accounted for:  $61.65M and 864,309 BTC**  
Feb 2014 - bankruptcy and closure   
March 2014 - Mt. Gox Data Leak  
May 2014  - The Willy Report; Willy-bot (referred to by Mark as the obligation exchange)    
July 2014  - First Creditor's meeting  
November 2014 Kraken selected to assist bankruptcy  
2015 - WizSec first report released  
Mid 2015 - Karpeles arrested  
2016 Findings - Multiple thefts dated back to 2011; Gox was insolvent for most of its existence; Gox traded its own liabilities on itself; connected to other bitcoin thefts  
2017 -Alexander Vinnek (WME) arrested; received over half million stolen Mt Gox bitcoins and other thefts, deposited them on various exchanges including Gox; alleged BTC-E admin  ";27;1;False;PM-ME-ALTCOINS;dqt6a2f;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/
"Some (a cold wallet) was simply ""misplaced"" (about 200k) and later found.

[The rest was transferred out of Mt Gox's hot wallet over a lengthy period of time - slowly but surely](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2015/04/the-missing-mtgox-bitcoins.html). Deliberate theft by an unknown party/parties.

Mark did some very shady things with manipulating account balances behind the scenes (which he did time in prison for), but has never been formally accused of stealing the coins. To date, nobody knows who is responsible.

Mark claims that some sort of malleability bug allowed the attacker to steal the coins. We will probably never know the truth - such claims require actual evidence of how the attack occurred, and none is forthcoming. Bitcoin legacy transactions *can* be malleated in some ways, but AFAIK this would not allow theft except in combination with poorly secured third party implementations. So Mark can't blame bitcoin here.

Edit: I've apparently been living under a rock. It's believed that the coins were [stolen by Alexander Vinnik](https://themerkle.com/sources-say-btc-e-hacked-mt-gox-of-2-21-billion-bitcoin-wizsec-on-official-report/) who has been arrested on money laundering charges.";59;3;False;CaptainOuzo;dqstahi;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"If people actually understood what they're buying, and used just a little bit of common sense, then most ""cryptos"" wouldn't have much value at all.

But that's not what's happening right now. Instead people are buying everything that looks like it could be the next big thing. Doesn't matter much what the real value propositions are, or if the fundamentals make any sense at all, or if there are actual use-cases for the things they are buying that go beyond speculation. All you need is a white paper full of technobabble and buzz words, a good marketing budget to create enough hype, and voila, people will buy your tokens and start shilling their new ""investment"" on social media for you.

Published in the late 1990s, the book was recommended by Oprah Winfrey and has been translated into 33 languages. As of 2009, it was estimated that three million copies had been sold in North America.

Totally agree. I tried all sorts of meditation over a number of years without success and then I found Transcendental Meditation (TM).  Works for me and the more I meditate the better I feel :) working on maintaining the practice though as it’s so easy for “life” to get in the way and before you know it weeks have slipped by without a practice. When really the meditation is the most important 20minutes of the day to give to myself :) ;1;0;False;G_S-Combs;dqsms53;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

">Mindfulness has become a buzzword but it really boils down to making an effort to become aware when you're upsetting yourself with regrets and hypotheticals.

I'd add that a lot of it too is practicing introspection. Every so often take a step back and try to look at your own thoughts from another perspective. Doing that really helps you avoid sweating the small stuff.

Maybe you haven't had your morning coffee and you're being irritable. If you have a habit of taking a step back and looking at your own thoughts, you'll naturally catch yourself and realize that your thoughts are being disproportionately influenced by some minor physical discomforts of tiredness and nausea. And when you look critically at those discomforts you realize they're very minor and not worth getting emotionally distraught over. Simply identifying something like that can make you calm down and the bad feelings nearly, if not entirely, evaporate.

It helps you catch yourself when you're being irrational or getting angry over things you don't want to spend the energy of being angry about. It helps you double check your decisions and general thought process. I would say it gives you a better sense of control over yourself and by extension your life.";1;0;False;BraveHack;dqssvy0;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"Although I agree with every word here, that's often too theoretical of answer for what people are really asking which is 'ya but how?' 

You gave the right answer of course with Mindfulness, but to take it to a more practical/actionable place (or as Gary Vee would say, from the clouds to the dirt), there's really only one place to start because it is the ONLY thing that will SHOW someone what all those awesome things you talk about FEEL like, which is the key to being able to find your way back there when you're in need, fortunately, as I'm guessing you know, that place is right under your nose in the form of your breath. 

By setting time aside (it can be as little as 3 minutes!) to observe the physical sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body (either from your nostrils, lungs, or belly, whatever feels most grounding to you), and gently and KINDLY returning your attention to it each and every time your mind wanders away, you begin to develop muscle memory for ""being present"". And after you've done it long enough (could be one session or could be 100, each person is different), something WILL eventually click and you'll experience a moment of PURE PEACEFULNESS the likes of which you've literally never known (which your mind, being the asshole it is, will immediately ruin by being all like 'omg omg I did it, I'm so awesome, holy shit maybe I'm Neo!')

But once you know, really, REALLY know where that 'place' you just travelled to is, getting back there will always be within your reach...as long as you continue to practice (yes, we talkin bout practice).

The key, and where a lot of beginners struggle and often quit too soon, is to not think of getting 'lost in thought' during the exercise as failure; in fact, suddenly recognizing that you've been in your mind instead of on your breath is literally THE ENTIRE POINT. Because the minute you realize you've been lost in thought you are...well, no longer lost. So instead of feeling bad or frustrated and thinking it isn't working (what isn't? Breathing? Ummm ya, it is), try to see each return to the breath as an unabashed victory, exactly like completing a rep in the gym when building a muscle, which, by the way, also has endless 'failures' within it...and yet the muscle continues to grow regardless as long as you just continue to lift.

Hopefully that can help someone here, be it the OP as he begins dealing with his incredible loss or anyone else struggling with something similar. Remember that although time may never heal, it sure as shit does a good job of dulling the pain.

So hold on tight and 
Just. Keep. Breathing.

Love.";354;11;False;My_Green_Van;dqsmnfk;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"You're right. Money will not console you on your last day, but it may buy the best drugs ... then maybe consolation will not be a priority anymore, as you're gonna be comfortable enough. Or maybe even asleep. When you're gone, you're gone. Doesn't matter what the circumstances of your life were, peace or not. Dead people don't worry.
So even in death money matters, if you can pay to make it comfortable, vs. just letting you suffer because you don't have the means, untill finally you die. All things considered, I'd much rather be rich than poor, even on my last day.

"Can love drive someone to suicide? Yes, and it can also drive people to kill somebody else. That doesn't mean that love is the cause of that.
The environment you grew up in, your personal history (traumas, shocking events etc), the state of your mind at any particular point in your life (substance abuse, obsession, fantasies), and your relations with people around you define how you *react* to things.

Point is there is never a single identifiable cause of your psychological issues (that's why I think the title of this thread is extremely misleading). It's always a mixture of factors, although your personal history and the environment you grew up in tend to play a huge role. So I guess we can agree on this now, that means this conversation had a purpose maybe :-D

I understand where you are coming from. I just don't like when people say you are not a doctor so STFU, because that is plain stupid.

I happen to think that we live in a society where doctors had somehow took too much power over our life. And most of the times they don't know much more than we do.

"I would argue that if you don’t raise your children to be decent human beings, you are an utter failure. You are not successful. 

So no, you can’t show me examples of successful people who raise their children to be awful humans. They are mutually exclusive. 

As to altruistic/philanthropic people, can you actually name specific examples?  I’m sure there are some altruistic people who raise terrible kids, but I think that is likely an anomaly. Usually we get our values from parents, and if a parent values being a decent human (altruism) it’s more likely that they raise another human to have that same value. 

My point isn’t that rich people don’t raise their kids right. It’s that being rich is a far worse measure of success than raising how your kids turn out. A rich man with wonderful decent people as children, is far more successful than a poor man with shithead kids. But the reverse is true too. A poor man who raises a good person is far more successful than a rich man with garbage humans for kids.

Maybe the norm will just change.

But then these days people living from salaries in Europe don't buy homes, ever, and it's completely normal to live and have kids and retire in a leased flat. Not even a house. Most people live in residential flats with thin walls so that you hear everything from the neighbors, it's pretty much like living in school dorms (uncomfortable) but it is really normal, nobody thinks about it.

"The best way I found is to do a ""white light"" meditation with an audio guide along with binaural beats (look this up - scientifically proven).
The narrator essentially starts by going through each individual and very specific part of your body from top to bottom and encourages you to relax these parts and visualize ""white light"" coming into them.  You wouldn't believe what sort of tension exists in these various parts until you are consciously told to relax them.  

It takes around 30 minutes and at first you will not be able to focus but don't worry - practice makes perfect.  When you get the hang of it, you will start feeling rushes of euphoria as you imagine the light passing through your body like a circuit.

"I don't know any of the schools or techniques or theory but I did manage to 'get it' first time of trying about four years ago.  Here's a few useful things I took from some youtube videos I watched initially:

- Don't keep your mind from wandering, your mind wandering is fine, just notice it, laugh it off like ""ha! minds wandering again... interesting..."".  It's as if the thought is fluttering by in front of your eyes and will drift out of your periphery again in a few seconds.

- If you need to focus on something, focus on the exact sensations of your breathing you may not have paid attention to before.  I like to try to gradually notice every part of my body first, like ""oh my feet are warm, there's a tingle in my left ankle"" etc.  Then I try to breathe with my nose up, as if I'm breathing the air to store it in between my eyes.  I'll notice the feeling as my stomach contracts, the warmth in the back of your mouth then the tingle between the eyes.  I initially breathe softly out through my mouth but eventually you'll naturally stop focusing on it as your breathing becomes automatic again.

- Keeping my feet planted helps.

- I don't do this all the time but if I'm struggling I start by picturing myself in the space I'm in now, I picture the items around me, the colours of the walls, I picture myself sat there and what I'd look like to someone stood behind me.  After this I gradually zoom out, I picture the square mile around me, the cars moving, the people sat in their gardens or walking into the shops and again I try to work myself into that image, sat in a chair in my house.  Now my whole town, 100 miles, sometimes my mind wanders here ""oh there's that city 200 miles away that my friend moved to, there he is walking down the street on lunch"" and again relate the distance and ambience back to myself.  For me the imagined pictures are never hectic as life can feel, the more you zoom out, the calmer and slower everything is, that isn't a conscious decision, just how it happens for me which is strange because my immediate life and work can be lightning paced.  Eventually I can reach a calm where I like to play around with 'moving myself' to different places and spaces, even millions of miles away but sat exactly as I am now, the same calm is everywhere and even if I'm sat on the moon my state of mind is still flat.  That's probably little out there and not even meditation but it definitely helps my body reach that dull vibration and switch off.

- I don't know if this is what people are supposed to feel but when it 'works', I feel very slightly cross-eyed and there's a tingle/tickle between my eyebrows, my feet and ass feel really heavy and when it REALLY works I start swaying, it's like I'm in a basket on a really calm sea, feels like my body is just swaying/rocking forwards and backwards really gently.

- When it works and you get up and move around, the sense of perspective is so weird, it's like you can see behind you and you notice colours of objects you hadn't really thought about before, woodgrain on that bedside lamp, white paint on the doorknob to the wardrobe.  Also everything is mildly amusing and less serious, kind of like a mild high.";6;3;False;Zone14;dqsucuv;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"**Loss aversion**

In economics and decision theory, loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it's better to not lose $5 than to find $5. This is also the implication of risk aversion. What distinguishes loss aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.

True, not all depression is chemical and it can very much be situational and if the situation lasts a long time it can make for a prolonged depression. I work at a mental health facility and I've seen it with people who have jobs that destroy them.

"Many things. The selling point of Ethereum however is that it's ""willing to move fast and break things"" to compensate for its shortcomings over time, which means regular hardforks for everything, from bailing out failed smart contracts to difficulty bombing miners to venture into the unknown that is PoS etc.

That's all good and fine, and works well enough as long as we're talking about a small niche project. But nobody in their right mind would want to become dependent on something as unpredictable and unproven as Ethereum. Buterin's central position in all of this doesn't help either. And no, Microsoft and others aren't building stuff on Ethereum, they're simply using the same code base.  The only people who don't care about any of this are the ones who create vaporware ICO's for quick profits. For that, as well as for gambling or something like cryptokitties, Ethereum is perfectly fine... if Buterin's plan to scale it actually works that is.

And all that said, that's not even the main issue why I wouldn't invest in Ethereum. The main reason is that having a completely separate platform like that for smart contracts is inefficient and unnecessary. The future of things like that will be built on top of a single secure blochain, everything else makes no sense. And that blockchain very much looks to be Bitcoin.";4;3;False;Qubane;dqsujkd;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I feel your pain, and I can relate, although you're in a worse situation than me. I worked for 10 years and I saved a lot of money. Like you I didn't travel much, as in I've never been out of my country. I'm in my early 30s, no kids and mostly single because starting a family is expensive. The idea is to be financially free before I get married and have kids.

The answer came when I got introduced to crypto and how money can be made in May 2017. I had saved up about $50k. I invested a little while learning as much as possible. Then in August, I invested 90% of my crypto funds into Binance. My investment went up 4x making me a millionaire in my country, South Africa. I was worth about 200k in US dollar terms, which is a lot in my country.

I then made a series of bad investments after China banned ICOs and there was FUD everywhere. Those investments resulted in me going from having about 200k to about 10k. That's how bad things got. I'm still trying to recover my initial investment and then get back to over 200k, and more.

I hope things work out for you. Remember, don't regret so much that it prevents you from seeing future opportunities. ";2;0;False;Sly21C;dqtmiyk;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/
"There is some good news to that if you look at it from a different perspective. The good news being that you've been living without that money for the past decade and have (I assume) gotten used to living like that, so, from what I got from your post, your immediate future hasn't really changed. I would imagine you've probably become pretty good at living on a small budget.

PLUS, and this is my personal view on the matter, you lost a major source of stress. Stress is a horrible thing and can kill. Maybe not immediately but eventually at the very least. Sure, you might stress over different things now, but the impression I get from your post is that you're doing pretty well all things considered and that any other stressors you might run into now won't be as powerful as what you described. I could be wrong. This is just my opinion.

This may sound like I'm being very dismissive of or belittling your experience, but that is not my intention. I'm just trying to add a perspective. :)";2;0;False;JawnTemplar;dqsuvcu;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"In my early twenties I worked for a startup that gave me 10k ""shares"" as a sign on bonus. After about a year I accumulated another 5k. Shortly after my first year the company was bought out by a Japanese company and everyone was layed off. They needed all the shares so they offered us a $1 per share (they were essentially worthless at this point) and I was newly unemployed and $15k sounded like a good deal. 

Fastword a year and they went public at $65 a share and continued to grow over the couple years I masochistically followed them. Basically I sold a million dollar ticket (more if I had waited a couple years) for 15k 

It hurts but it wasn't the end of the world (kind of felt like it a little bit for a while) but not enough to end an otherwise early life...

"If you're dependant on antidepressants and hookers, you have bigger problems than hating your job.

Now I'm in Cambodia, it's a genuine shithole but I like it much better than my old life. People don't seem less happy here than where I came from, even though their situation is objectively a lot worse.

I look at the poverty around me and at the large number of expensive black SUVs on the streets, and I think about all the average people driving old scooters and working for $300/month or less. I went to a shopping center and they have 65"" 4k TVs that cost as much as back home, more than a year's salary for most people here. It seems that flashing wealth and status is more important than fixing the problems here. I would love to feel connected to the people here, to share their dreams and burdens.

"Depending on how much you need to maintain a comfortable life, you can get class B RVs that come equipped with showers and plumbing, you just need to worry about emptying it out when the tanks get full.

Personally, if I were to ever take on something like that, I would ditch some moderate comfort to just get a nationwide gym membership for showers and washroom facilities. That's what a lot of these people do. Just for the sake of not having to empty tanks every week. They still outfit them with heaters, solar panels, kitchenettes, composting toilets, and TV antennas if they wish. They have everything they need, just within the radius of a parking space. Some even get really clever and install rain collection systems so they don't even need to fill up their water tanks every week. 

No it's not for everyone, but for the people it's for, they seem to be a lot happier not having to worry about utility bills and property tax and rent and hydro every month. You have to cut down on some comforts in exchange for less stress.

Also, not everyone does it to travel either, which is something a lot of people associate with vanlife. Many just dwell within their cities and pay for a mailbox membership.

Like if he made a million dollars on bitcoin he would reset the clock on his suicide and try life again. One of his first submissions clearly states something like ""If i had a million dollars, i'd enjoy the fuck out of that.""

But he didn't make it. And in the end he saw his failure not as a random shitting on by market, but as a personal flaw in himself. So he blamed himself and decided HE was the problem.

"To address some of your points, POS will initially be integrated to only 1 out of every 150 blocks so it's not like if it does not work the system will fail. Next, you say that developers are not using the ethereum blockchain just the same ""base code"".  If that is true, then where is the network to support the base code backed up with thousands of people mining to log transactions. Ethereum is just a developable blockchain solution exactly like you called for bitcoin to become. You do understand that for bitcoin to become even practical (not $11 transaction fees lol) there will be multiple forks to achieve the desired outcome. You shit on ether for having forks but atleast it's usable as a currency (more transactions than visa per second and $ .60 transaction fee)  

So tell me why there would be a need to create yet another developable blockchain with massive amounts of transactions/s and small fees when ethereum already satisfies.

"Wealth would be great. Your chances of becoming wealthy are absurdly slim, to the point of being non existent. 

Unless you have wealthy parents, which, given your desire for wealth seems unlikely. If you did, it would be a foregone conclusion. But you don’t, so the most likely scenario is that you never achieve it. 

The system is rigged against you, man.  And before you say “well look at all these bitcoin millionaires” I’d remind you that there are a lot more lottery millionaires than bitcoin millionaires. That right, more people have been made millionaires via picking random numbers, than via investing in btc. And just like the lottery people, lots of these guys will end up broke in short order. And statistically, they barely register as existing. 

Don’t live or die by if you become wealthy, because the overwhelming odds are against you. And frankly, what makes you special?  Why are you going to buck those odds?  Are you an inventor?  An unparalleled genius?  Or just one of the billions of people who likes money?

But you can be successful, and have an amazing life. Wealth is awesome, but it isn’t everything. It can strip the joy out of things, because they come so easily. It can strip the purpose from your life because you don’t actually need to do anything of value. It can rob you of friends and loves, because maybe they just like your money. It can MAKE you a failure at life. But it sure as shit can be fun.

"At any given moment you are feeling a particular emotion for a particular reason.

The trick is to be self aware enough first to know what you are feeling, then to know why you are feeling that. Next level is understanding what other people are feeling, and then making good judgement about why they are feeling that way.

It takes practice and inner peace, both of those feed into each other.

For instance I felt upset by this post. Why? Because I feel guilt over losing our house and getting fucked over in divorce negotiations. Knowing that I am upset lets me examine those feelings of guilt to help deal with them.

Once you know what and why you are feeling, you can begin to modify your behaviour and reaction to things. Knowing that stories about financial failure or regret will upset me, lets me accept that feeling and not let it rule me.

It's kind of like a game to remain in a zen state of calm and quiet happiness.

Once you accept that, accepting things in life become much easier. My existence, my past, me typing this very message, all probabilities that have accumulated over millennia leading to this very moment.

After I started viewing life as such, accepting the fact that I had fuck ups become more palatable: I played the odds with insufficient information and got it wrong, next time I'll try to get the odds on my favors (although chance of failure still exists).

I wanted to buy BTC when it was $10. I was too poor to afford it back then and thought it was stupid. Here I am today, never bought bitcoin and now living quite okay financially.

Mindfulness has become a buzzword but it really boils down to making an effort to become aware when you're upsetting yourself with regrets and hypotheticals. And making an effort each day to cut through the bullshit and remind yourself of the things you're grateful for that actually happened instead of might happen.

At the end of the day, life is what's happening to you right now. And it's easy to miss by dwelling on the past or the many things that *might* happen in the future.

"Yes. Being in the moment is easier if you embrace it physically instead of mentally. Thoughts are like a river that you can at best direct, but only unreliably.

I have minor PTSD (probably, who knows how minor it is; I have it), and my therapy revolves around getting out of my head and getting into what I'm doing. This is not professional advice, but:

identify a thought as a thought. If you are working on something and a thought comes in like ""shit, how am I going to pay that bill?"" or ""my wife is going to be mad at me for this"" or even just ""is it supposed to rain tomorrow"", instead of pursuing the thought, say to yourself ""I have a thought about my wife being mad at me for something"". Identify the thought, then leave it alone and get back to what you're doing.

This is aided by connecting to your surroundings on a physical level. Feel the weight of your body in your chair, your feet in your shoe, touch something tactile with your hand. Hear the sounds around you: the buzz of a computer, background chatter, etc. Literally ""come to your senses"". This has helped me get out of my head and get back into the moment.

There are entire books about this, but some forms of meditation are basically this, by focusing on breathing. This helps me with day-to-day activities, to help me stop my mind from racing, and to help my body calm down. It's a much more tangible exercise than it is a pure thinking exercise.";1;0;False;leagaleagle;dqtb3qc;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"Research has shown regular mindfulness practice (3-5 days/week) makes measurable changes in the brain and nervous system. It creates more dense gray matter and develops greater neuroplasticity, which essentially translates to greater resilience to stress and greater awareness and control of your physical and emotional sensations. 

Mindfulness practice is best viewed as exercise for the nervous system. 

Download an app like Calm or Headspace, or find guided mindfulness clips on YouTube to listen to, in order to start learning how to do it.

"The easiest way to get a moment's refresh is to try the SLLS technique (Stop, Listen, Look, Smell). 

Stop from what you're doing, close your eyes take a deep slow breath (4 seconds, 4 seconds out) and feel the abs moving and the lungs expanding. 

Listen to the sounds around you, which is the farthest? Which is the closest? Don't judge, just let it be.

Open your eyes and look at the big picture around you, the depth of streets, the height of buildings compared to yours, the small details, the things moving all around you at once, the colors, the reflections. 

Take another slow deep breath in along with the sounds, the image, feel whatever sensation the smell around you awakens.

Now you should be out of the inner chatter.

Mindfulness Meditation. It's the whole point.;1;0;False;DetrART;dqssqjk;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/
"For me, I noticed that my life was increasingly stressful and full of distractions. After a lot of stress, I realized I never take the time to just sit and let my mind wander. I've never been a religious or spiritual person, but taking even just 10 minutes out of every day to just sit alone and be bored, my mind wanders to some pretty useful places. I guess you can call it meditation, but my pursuit isn't to reach some higher plane of enlightenment, but I could definitely see how religious practitioners of meditation would feel like it does.

Solutions to longstanding problems have come to me by just sitting without stimulus and letting my consciousness drift. So many good ideas, ways to approach conflict,  noticing who around me might be suffering, and how to be more sensative, or even help them in some way.


I don't play music, or tv, or be on my phone. I just lay down in front of a fan with my eyes closed and have a 10 minute timer on.

I don't know if this will work for everyone, and I only have a tenuous grasp on the psychological mechanisms behind it, but since doing it, I've noticed that tome has stopped racing by, I have developed a better awareness of the here and now, and come to realize who is important in my life, how I can be there for them, what my needs, wants and incentives are, and how to meet them, and who to ask for help with those things.

It is definitely a habit to be formed, and at first, I would beat myself up for not making the time for each day at first, but the more I did it, the more I realized that I'm not perfect, I'll miss things from time to time, and each day is a new opportunity to do it right. 

Realistically, I probably do it 3-4 times a week, with my goal being every day, but even that has been a huge help.

The other part of this is to either journal right afterwards so I can preserve the results of the experience, or (if I have the privacy for it) to just put on a recorder and try to speak what comes to my mind. It's very freeing to have a place where I can be open with myself about who I am, and put that into reality so that I can reflect on it. 

It's nice to just have a few minutes of calm each day, without screens, or people, or work, or any demands placed on me. It helps me focus on what I want to get done that fay, and what I can realistically accomplish.

Like I said, this is just my experience, so I don't k ow what kind of effect this would have on everyone, but maybe it would be worth a shot to see what happens.";1;0;False;eitauisunity;dqss3kx;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

Agree 100%. My dad shot himself three years ago, and he was saying that his problem was a 900$ motorbike. We never had a financial problem in our family, but as soon as he bought that motorbike, he started saying that he was selfish and our family could have been ruined for that 900$, which did not make any sense. He lost his mind in this self-destroying trip, he went to several doctors who said he was depressed. he shot himself on my mum 50th birthday (8 months later) as a birthday present and asking for forgiveness from my and my brother.

This is going to be unpopular. Money has no value, its the value you give it. Honestly, say youre the person who owned bitcoin when it was dirt, then again when its something significant, has it changed you? And for how? There is consequences for action both “good” and bad, but what matters is person. How is it going to change you? Is it? Then you have to wonder, how would it change your life. You could do things, you could learn things, you could taste things, feel, but would your heart really change? For the better? People live life and look for what they desire and think things or doing stuff will solve it, does it really? Or is the center of your heart stay? Money, in this world will come and go, what you can afford, buy, hell, even buy for other people doesnt change who you are.

"One of my best friends sent me Facebook PM, ""Want to see a dead body?"" then a picture. It was a screenshot of 2 bitcoins bought at $1,000 each and a transfer of them to another wallet - his brother's. He was nervous about having them and gave them to his brother who almost definitely immediately sold them.

Missed opportunities happen. It sucks. Resilience is key, as is appreciating what you already have. If you can't do that you'll never be happy. There's never any 'happily ever after.' Either you're satisfied or you're not, and no amount of money will change that. It can ease pressure, sure, but - and I am damn sorry to be harsh here - something else in your brother's life would have probably driven him to suicide later. Either he'd sell 'too early' and get only one yacht instead of two or he'd lose a loved one or anything else. 

What's important is how *you deal with your grief.* There's a lot of hard shit about getting older but the hardest, and I'm quoting Cormac McCarthy here, is ""accepting that not everybody will get to do it with you."" His pain is over. Yours is just beginning. It's good you're trying to cope, but the loss of a loved one isn't something you get over quickly or completely.

If you're lucky you will get old. Your bones will ache and you'll wake up to piss three times a night and your older relatives may forget their own names or yours. But that's what life is: Survival and decay. Enjoy the good shit and if you get rich, all the better, it'll help you live well a little longer.

"Condolences to you and your family. I can't imagine how he must have felt. Losing 6000 or 15000 BTCs, whether through a hack or through selling them early, is a situation no one wants to be in.

Thanks for posting this story, it really hit home. 
I started investing into Bitcoin and other alt coins in May 2017. I started off with 8 Bitcoins. I invested into Binance, using almost all my funds, which took me to a peak of 25 Bitcoins. Then the China FUD happened, and my Bitcoin wealth declined back to about 8 Bitcoins. I then wanted to get back to 25 Bitcoins or more by investing into riskier alt coins. No risk no reward was my mentality. I made a series of emotional trades, investments and gambles which has resulted in me having 1 Bitcoin now. So I lost 7 Bitcoins.

Reading your story, mine is nothing and I should be okay. Had I lost 800 Bitcoins, I wouldn't be alive today.

I'm withdrawn from my family, and my sister has complained recently. I quit my part time studies because I'm consumed by the possibility of riches in cryptocurrenies. Luckily I still have my job.

I think it is important to realize in a situation like your brother was in, that, while you certainly missed on a great opportunity, you did not really lose anything since you didn't work for it or put a lot of efford into it. He nirmally never would have had this opportunity anyways like all his other friends and family members. It's like almost winning the lottery for example. In the end, you did what you thought was best to do. It all comes down to you ignoring the fact that you made a mistake and move on to something that makes you happy again. This doesn't only apply to financial things. ;1;0;False;Dont-HugMeIm-Scared;dqsnmgv;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I can understand that. I recently made a massive mistake and lost the majority of the coins I had been holding onto over the last two years. Not nearly as big as the perceived loss of your brother's, but a substantial loss for my life, and it constantly comes back to mind, hitting me with new thoughts about what I would have been able to do with that money. The freedom I would have finally had. The support I could finally provide my family. The assistance I could give to my friends....

Luckily I didn't lose everything, and I'm just focusing on not making the same mistakes, and rebuilding my holdings again. 

Most of the growth has happened in the last year anyway. It really doesn't take long in the scheme of things, even though I'll never forget how much ground I lost with that stupid mistake. 

Anyway, it's nothing compared to what your brother experienced, and I'm so sorry he chose to end his life...whatever the ultimate reason may has been.";1;0;False;Aegist;dqsnedo;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"Please accept my sincere condolences.

it is really bad, what happened to your brother, but it is not really related to bitcoin. I know about people in the 80ths who have very similar stories to tell about the money they lost or missed or both when trading stocks and yforex and stumbled into banks' trap in the financial crisis. 

your brother soon realises the value and the inner worth of bitcoin and it seems he really suffered a lot from the missed opportunity. That's bad, but should show you a way that ""never"" does not really exist.

Money, getting rich and wealth is not the only thing to focus on. I can only guess, but for me it sounds like your brother probably had mayxbe more than ""bitcoin missing"" and self-nagging problems.

For the relatives left behind is is a never-ending search for the reasons and financial problems are on the top of the list, but  it doesn't matter if it is bitcoin, lost savings, gabling or or or ...

At the point of lacking any information of whats to come, any action is considered rational. Only after time passes and you know the outcome you start feeling sorry for missed chances , but you should not! Not knowing something in the first place is not a chance at all, and If you end up gaining something out of such situation it is all up to your luck and nothing else. Its the same as winning the lottery.

"This makes me worried for the incoming bubble pop. So many crypto traders delude themselves into thinking they are not speculating and that crypto will become the new currency. While this is possible, it's incredibly unlikely. I personally value crypto, but I'm only maybe 10% sure it will not pop. A lot of people here think there's a 80-90% probability crypto will succeed. That's absurd. It worries me because such a high confidence means they probably haven't diversified and will lose most of their savings pretty soon. I expect more suicides.

"I’m sorry for your loss. A friend of mine attempted suicide one night and ended up getting arrested and 10yr prison sentence for assaulting a cop.   

When someone’s financial dreams are dashed, it can be pretty devastating.  Since it is Christmas season, seems fair to point out that George Bailey in Its a Wonderful Life proved that even one of the most beloved of people can feel abandoned, hopeless and suicidal. 

At one point or another we’re all looking for a Clarence to get us through the shit.   And we all know George Bailey type people who have succumbed to despair. 

It may not be popular in times of tragedy but maybe awareness would benefit from reviewing what are considered the seven deadly sins: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins

Greed is one of them.  I suspect greed is a motivating factor of many bitcoin investors. Then again I know many involved in bitcoin aren’t per se greedy but slightly obsessed with it or astonished by it. 

I once worked with the Army suicide program. They had a decent handle on the retrospective analysis of suicide but had trouble nailing down the predictive signals. 
Usually, the person had a troubled history, was not religious, and recently made a major change—like moving to a new base or back home etc.  Then they’ll get in trouble so like an arrest and all the trouble that causes becomes overwhelming and yeah, end their lives.  

I learned that there is no magic bullet but having strong ties to friends, family and community greatly decrease the risk.  Everyone reading this should think about their own lives and connections to others because truly they represent life’s only everlasting treasure.  That, and snorting coke off a hooker’s tits.

"Sorry for your loss. Can't imagine how it must feel.

I sometimes feel depressed that I hadn't heard of bitcoin earlier because I know I would have gotten into it, I did immediately when I learned about it in early 2013. I have several full full bitcoins but otherwise I'm dirt poor and can only get crap low paying jobs now and then because I'm middle aged and employers here want to have a ""young team"" so they don't hire older people unless they have special skils. It is tempting to cash in the coins but if I would spend them they are gone forever and I'll never get that kind of money ever again. So I dare not spend them. People say that 1 bitcoin might make you a millionaire but that might take 20 years and I'll be old when that happens. Wish I had heard about it earlier than early 2013 so I could have mined with a PC before the ASICs took over.

That's a rough story.  But it's a good example why none of us should live in the past.  A similar situation as your brother, I had 300,000 shares in a penny stock company back in 2011.  It floundered for months and months.  Along comes a fortune 500 company and buys them out literally the day after I sold.  I bought into all the fud that the buyout was just a rumor.  I would have made millions. Ancient history.  Like your brother, I was inconsolable for weeks.  Especially with my dad making fun of me constantly for wasting my money on the stock market. So I get.  I wish your brother wouldn't have withdrawn from his support system.  That's the worst mistake we can make when we're depressed.;1;0;False;Married2BPD;dqsz02a;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

So sorry for you loss mate. I relate to your brothers pain in knowing you were an early adopter, I mined over 6,000 BTC and probably close to 50,000 LTC (just as it came out it was so easy) I was really doubtful about all that and sold everything for $1000 about to cover my electricity costs. So I am really gutted because I could have retired now.. And that is what sits in the back of your mind, constantly nibbling away at your happiness. It can lead to severe depression. I avoided this by living of the philosophy that money does not bring happiness.  I have a great wife, a 8 month bouncing boy.. that is the only treasure that matters and the only thing worth fighting for. I bought back into BTC and LTC and trippled my profit.. yes I am happy because no bank will do that and my sons college fund is now sorted. Again.. sorry for your loss mate - It is sad that money causes more pain than happiness. ;1;0;False;ppumkin;dqsyoms;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"That's seriously painful.

What he may not have understood is that WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME SITUATION as him.  Whether he got rid of them too early, or lost them, we all decided to buy a cup of coffee, go to the movies, or otherwise spend $5 in March of 2010, rather than buying 5,000 BTC on Bitcoinmarket.

His mental health issues are what caused his suicide, and bitcoin was just the outlet.  The rest of us who are closer to neurotypical have found ways to cope with the prospect of lost opportunities.

What we all need to remind ourselves is that, in the moment, we make good decisions.  In May of 2010, was it a good idea to buy a pizza with 10,000 BTC?  Hell yeah!  It was worthless, and had no quantifiable prospect of success.  Was it a bad idea to sell a pizza for 10,000 BTC?  Definitely.

Given the same situation, the same knowledge, we're likely to make the same decision again.

In any case, he didn't kill himself, but it's obviously sucks. Killing yourself over losing money is a huge overreaction. People lose their family, lose their home, become permanently disabled, everyday. Losing a fortune sucks, but that situation still leaves you in the same situation as everyone else.

"Hi OP. Thank you for sharing this.

To anyone else in a similar situation please remember that you had the intelligence and foresight to see the potential of bitcoin years before anyone else. 

What is not to say that you can't do the same again but with some other technology. 

I was born in the seventies. So far I've been through the the mainstream adoption of PC's, Electronic Payment Systems (VISA etc,), Mobile Phones, Budget Air Travel, Internet, E-Commerce, Smartphones, GPS/Sat Nav and I'm sure I've missed a few.

Even over the next decade they will be technologies created that make everything that has come before seem old fashioned, outdated and boring.

Around 2000 I had quite a few shares in a uk internet company called Freeserve, they didn't seem to be going anywhere so I sold them and bought a pinball machine.... Not long after the price skyrocketed. I was young and foolish but learned a important lesson.

Also I would suggest that it is much better to make your worst fuck-up's in your 20's when you've got plenty of time ahead of you than to make amends than to start making major fuck-up's in your 60's. Which I see all the time.

Take care folks!

"Being rich isn't all it's cracked up to be. It destroys your relationships with your family and friends. Either you try to keep it a secret from them (which they find out eventually from your purchases), or you tell them and they start treating you differently. Not only by some of them feeling entitled to your money, but others saying how you don't deserve the money, you didn't earn it, and don't everything else to make you feel like shit.  
  
On top of that, if you're single, it makes it even harder to find a girlfriend. Everyone in your life before your fortune is of the same worth as before your fortune. You probably live in a cheap location with lack of girls with access to similiar wealth and you don't wanna marry scum. On top of that, it's hard to justify spending money on nice things because you don't wanna attract a girl who is attracted to money. If she sees your fancy car and nice suits and smiles at you, it's an instance turn off. You automatically know it's because of how you look and dress, which you can never live up to those expectations she now has. Once you realize this, you start taking care of yourself even less. Get haircuts less, shave less often. If you don't want a girl to be attracted to your looks and money, you become the opposite of that.

Also, once other people know you're wealthy, they start charging you more. Especially your accountant. Who you didn't need when you were poor, but now desperately need so you don't go to jail for not paying taxes or lose all your money doing something stupid. And it's not like you can negotiate with him and say ""Oh, that's expensive. I can't afford to pay you $5000 to do my taxes"" because he knows what you can afford and can't.

"With YouTube, I had made over 12,000$ USD before the age of 16. I was getting monthly direct deposits of well over a thousand dollars every month. In my head, it was never going to stop coming in so I spent my money like an idiot. Sure, I built myself a nice computer, I paid myself some nice vacations in Cuba and more, but I never saved any of it or did anything else with it than spend it. It was all fun and games until I received two (bullshit) copyright claims in two days, shutting down my channel. 

That was all back in 2011-2012, one of my friend was heavily into Bitcoin and loved the idea and concept. He himself had quite a lot, which he ended up using on SilkRoad to buy hallucinating cactus for about 6 or 7 BTC. To this day, he *still* brings it up and how that cactus wasn't worth 60,000+ dollars. 

He spent a lot of time trying to convince me to even invest a small 1,000$ into BTC and sit on it. Back then it wouldn't have been much and it would have been worth it ! But I didn't personally believe in it. I kind of regret it nowadays ! 

But what I've been told is that you can't just keep looking back at ""what *could* have happened"", because if you do this, you'll go crazy at every mistakes you made. LEARN from the past instead. Which is now why I am heavily involved in Monero (XMR) nowadays with both mining and investing.

Financial bubbles are really incredibly psychologically stressful. Hindsight investing is just so clear and easy, it's easy to amplify vivid visions of ""what could have been"" and stew in it. And there can be big swings in fortune that are totally out of one's control. And it's hard to put anything behind you when the hype is still ongoing.

I also hope this thread will encourage others who are feeling similarly to your brother to reach out. There are reasons why it's hard to cope.

"I am truly sorry for your loss, very tragic 🙁

I had some of my savings into Bitcoin and I was able to get 0.2 BTC. I was so proud of ""owning"" even a portion of BTC!
Of course, I was too late to the game with regards to Bitcoin mining.

When I started getting more interested into it, I looked into getting an Antminer S9.
Electricity is pretty cheap here and I did the math. A single S9 could have been a good investment.

I tried finding an Antminer S9 locally, although there is a huge markup on those units and I didn't want to pay 2x the price.
Bitmain didn't have them in stock either.
Then I found a ""retailer"" online.
At this point you probably can see me coming, right?

Price was good, website seemed legit... I did not see all the redflags as I was so thrilled by the idea of finally getting one of those elusive Bitcoin miners.

It's always easy to say after the fact ""oh, I should have..."" I was tricked and now i'll never get my 0.1708 BTC back. This number shall remain printed in my mind forever.

I still kick myself everyday for having been tricked. I consider myself a bit tech savvy, i'm familiar with the fishing and scams. I guess the ego takes a big hit.
Oh well, I'll probably be downvoted on this as I probably deserve what happened.

That's only a portion of a Bitcoin you'll say, but I feel so depressed right now. And although I'm well aware that this was money ""I could afford to lose"", now was not the time as I am going through difficult times right now.

I am seeing it now as I know I am being more reclusive, I don't talk as much to family, don't return calls. No one knows what happened as I feel so ashamed about it.

"I’m sorry to hear about your brother OP. It really sucks that someone would place so much worth in money... Especially since it sounds like he sold out his Bitcoin. That’s the thing about investments (of any kind); there’s always a chance it’s going to go up and you’ll loose money. 

My parents raised me to put a lot of emphasis on money. My dad grew up a poor Dutch-Indo/Taiwanese immigrant and my mother, while from a relatively affluent family, lived in the very country side of Japan, which is a pretty poor area. My parents met in Japan, but because my mom married an American, she was disowned. They were both poor and had to work extra hard to make ends meet. Luckily my dad is one of the smartest guys I know, and he ended up becoming a stocks broker, making over $700,000 a year by his mid 30s and my mom stayed home and raised my brother and I. 

So my parents always told me money was pretty much everything. “If you don’t have a career and money, you’re either lazy, stupid, or both.” That mixed with the condescending parenting style of a Japanese mother and a father who thought working to provide for family was more important than providing emotional nurture, I grew up thinking money would solve all my problems. 

Flash forward a bit; I was gifted 5BTC when it was still about $350. I was pretty happy when I sold most of it for $800. Recently I checked my Coinbase account and saw Bitcoin went up to over $10,000. The $50 I left in there is over $600 the last time I checked. Am I sad about it? Yeah, I could have had over $50,000. That’s enough to pay my rent for the next 4ish years. But it was my choice to sell it when I did. If I had waited longer I could have had more money than I’ve ever had in my bank account (don’t judge, I’m only 20yo) but I didn’t, and that’s okay too. 

I’m really sorry about you brother OP. Thanks for sharing your story and may he Rest In Peace. ";4;0;False;shedidntwakeup;dqsq5ph;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

The same exact thing as your brother happened to me. I'm not going to kill myself but it's too painful for words. I was an early adopter, I preached bitcoin to everyone, and I *knew* it was going to take off like it has. I spent my coins everywhere I could, just excited to see anyone accepting them and truly believing in the technology. I had a large stockpile that I every intention of just holding. Shit happened and now I'm completely empty handed and I can barely pay my damned rent.

I learned about bitcoin very early on because of my interest in dark web markets and hacker culture. Cheapest I remember bitcoin at was like $10. It is very depressing to think about. But the way I see it is that I don't deserve that kind of money because my own cowardice and lack of impulse control is why I didn't buy in.

Bitcoin/crypto has been the fastest growing asset class over a number of years. However, it has had unique risks, that make the charts potentially deceptive. Risk of loss, theft, hacking, scams, etc are not well reflected in typical price charts. Bitcoin is not the first investment or activity where I have experienced such problems, but for many people taking responsibility for choosing which systems to (dis)trust in such a manner may be a new experience. Gambling experiences can be psychologically destabilizing, and so can investment. ;3;0;False;turpin23;dqsiop4;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/
"That really, really sucks. I'm sorry for your loss OP. 

People, remember that Bitcoin's rise is not unique or ""once-in-a-lifetime"". Major booms like this happen once a decade, if not more often (5 years ago it was weed stocks, 10 years ago it was social media, 20 years ago it was internet companies...). If we go even further into the speculative market, you could technically make bitcoin's gains off options or penny stocks whenever you want. 

The tough part about missing out on bitcoin is that many people were ""right"" about it as early as 2012, but never bought in or sold too early. Consider that not many people bought at $10 and have held till now; most people, if they're lucky, have only made double digit gains over the past 5 years, which is pretty good, but not life-changing spectacular.

I'm sorry to hear this man, I'm sure it's very tough for you.  I just wanted to post a related message to the community given how much price talk has been around lately.  Money isn't everything.  It's a famous enough saying but people ignore it all the time.  We're shown images everyday of rich people and we all wonder what it would be like to have that kind of power / capability to do whatever we want whenever we want but keep in mind plenty of people who have a lot of money / fame / celebrity are miserable.  Depression doesn't discriminate via your bank account.  Focus on friends and family, find something / someone you care about and lose yourself in it, it will prove far more rewarding in the long run.  Those of us who get too caught up in getting rich do so at the expense of the most important things in life.  Don't end up a miser alone in your mansion with only your piles of cash to comfort you.  Or worse end up taking your own life.   Best wishes to the OP and his family.;3;0;False;PercentEvil;dqsa7cy;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I'm very sorry to hear about your loss - it's tragic in many different ways!

I started buying Bitcoins when they were around $5 - by the time I could actually complete those transactions, they were at around $12, then I bought some more at $18. Back then, I felt they had the potential to go to $10,000 some day.

Eventually, I had about 120 BTC, all bought at less than $30 (I never spent more than $2000 buying them). They fell in price and stayed low for a long time after I sold some at around $100 or so - but I had basically sold as much that anything happening would never cause me a loss ... even with Mt.Gox going down, and with them some of my Bitcoins and some of my € that I still had there (and couldn't get the money out because ... well, they were going down).

Eventually, Bitcoin rose again and I sold the remaining 10 or so that I've had at around $500 (I think some at $400, some at $800).

Long story short: I had very little risk, and selling them gave me money when I needed it. I probably made about $6000 of profit, maybe $8000.

Yes, had I held on to those 120 BTC that I once had, with little investment, I would now be a millionaire (at least if I now sold them). That would be very cool and make a lot of things in life a lot easier. BUT: I'm pretty sure I would have been super-stressed out with all the ups and downs and I'm not sure I would/could actually sell them now. The stress might have killed me by now. You never know.

So ... yeah ... keeping at least a few would have probably been a good idea, especially given that I had this $10,000 number in my head even in those early days.

"I'm sorry for your loss OP.

I work in financial industry. There is a sentence I always say that can be translated as ""we are all good traders when looking to the past"".

It's too easy to ""become rich"" when we already know what assets or investments were the best bets for the last years. But find them while the future is uncertain is the reason why becoming rich isn't easy in financial markets. Even if we can correctly pick the winners, we are not sure we have them in hand, and we are not sure about what price to pay, neither when to sell.

When I first invested in BTC I knew it would make some good money. I sold for enough money to buy a not-so-new car, but if I hold it up to now, would have enough for a really nice house. Do I blame myself? No, because I didn't know it few years ago.

It's really sad your brother didn't have the chance to live to learn that there are so much more important things than money/bitcoins. Mental health care needs to be so much better, suicide is the end of a painful and horrible illness that can be treated, if it's done properly. I had unexpected health issues in 2016 that I have now overcome and had treatment for, I can say hand on heart I would have given all my possessions, including bitcoins to stop feeling how I did before. Now I'm better I realise good health is worth more than millions of dollars, I don't stress over how much I could have if I did X or Y in the past any more. I don't think you can truly learn that unless you face a tragedy and come through the other side. The co-founder of Reddit, Aaron, also completed suicide. Treatment must get better, it's years behind where it should be by now.;66;4;False;chillipepz;dqs8qyn;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"Honestly, money can make your life a lot better in a lot of ways but it should never be the most important thing in your life. Even if you're rich it doesn't make you any happier, I've probably been more stressed than ever before after my net worth reached seven figures-I have more work than ever before and more fear about losing what I've earned (not just in crypto).

I think we all see a little bit of OP's brother in ourselves, obsessing about the opportunities we missed out on by the smallest of margins. I had planned on investing in the ETH ico with about 10 bitcoin but missed it due to delays in the ICO and work obligations and I remembered the day after the actual ICO. Then out of bitterness I refused to buy any ETH. That was an 8 figure goofup right there, and similarly I did something like that for the IOTA ICO, and the NXT ICO (which was only 15 bitcoin).

You can always look back and think about how you came so damned close to being worth tens of millions, but what's the point?

I think we all need to take some deep breaths and go talk some nice walks and hikes instead of constantly obsessing over the price of Bitcoin day in and day out. Ever since the price hit 5 figures I've been probably spending 20 hours a week reading about Bitcoin and looking at prices, which is likely not very healthy and I've been obsessing about the things I missed out on by the stupidest of margins and wondering what I would be doing now if I had just made it in time for this ICO or that one.

"I walked away from around $50 million when I was 16. I dated a girl for awhile who was one of two heirs to a fortune exceeding $100M. Her family offered to buy us a house, and provide for everything including ""small"" amounts of spending cash (5 figures a month) until I could ""get on my feet,"" if we ended up deciding to marry. Interestingly enough, they were all fantastic people; I loved her family. The downside is I'd have had to marry *her,* and she unfortunately did not flourish under the lavish spoiling her family subjected her to. Marriage was on the table for a few months, until I decided that I'd be making a huge mistake tying myself to her for life.

There's very little that helps when you lose a loved one. I've been through that too... it sounds like your brother tied his self-worth to his net-worth, and that's a very dangerous thing to do. There's a lot of highs and lows in life, and as you said - it's not worth letting one mistake be worse than it needs to be. I wish he'd found peace in the end.

For me, walking away from that kind of money early on was a big deal. I don't think I fully appreciated either a) what kind of life that kind of money could have enabled for me or b) what kind of commitment I'd have been really taking on to access it, but I've never regretted the decision. However, it's something which has shaped me: I know that there are things that are more important than money. I know what I'm *not* willing to do to be rich. I've managed to do pretty well for myself on my own, and feel like I've earned my success... which has always been important to me. And, importantly, I've had experiences along the way that I'll cherish.

The end goal for most of us probably shouldn't be to 'get rich,' but rather to live a satisfying life. I hope most of us find our way there.";11;1;False;kaeroku;dqsnp4v;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"this might get burried but anyway ... so I guess I can share

I was kind of invested in the silkroad back in 2010 - 12. All the transactions were done in BTC and having over 3000 BTC just ""laying around"" was quite normal back then ... as you might or might not know, things got dark in the darknet and the platform for got raided ... so I did the only logical thing for me at that time ... I sold everything I had & could as fast as possible including tumbling my coins and getting my money out as long as I could ... I sold most of them for ~ 70€/BTC. 

I didn't think much of it at that time ... I just wanted to get the fuck out. Now, even though I'm pretty successful in my new job, there's not one day that goes by that I don't think what could have been. I find myself awake at night wondering why I didn't just keep the god damn things ... after all, I didn't really need the money at that point.

There's this lingering feeling/voice that always reminds you of your ""bigges fuck-up"". I can relate to your brothers feelings, it's not only the missed out opportunity, it's this feeling/voice that reminds you of it. It's similar like the feeling you get if you think about something embarrassing you did as a child/teenager and you feel shitty for a second or two until you shake it off. Now, not only is this hard to shake off as something you did when you were young and stupid, it's also quite likely the biggest fuckup that you can do in your lifetime and it's not only your brain that reminds you of it, it is everywhere these days, everything constantly reminding you of ""what a failure you are"" for not sticking with it and quite honestly, if I didn't have my job, my cat and my brothers & parents, maybe some of the awake nights I would not only contemplate ...";30;4;False;Liquidicity;dqsohha;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

The key is to not play the ""what ifs"". Money was just one factor. Drinking was a major one, prescription pills (Xanax) were other major factors. The final factor was a terrible sleeping pill (while she was withdrawing from Xanax) that has a side affect of ""could cause death"".

"Firstly, very sorry too hear this.

In our society we are bred to believe money is the be and end all - it's a flaw of capitalism.

Money can put you in those situations where you may be happy - yet, it might change those around you, making you less content with what life is. 

Happiness comes from being on a meaningful path, growing and being with people who would be with you if there was no money.

If it's hard to see this, please travel and get out of your social circle for a while - our hierarchical history leads us to want rank, and money often opens these doors. Being away gives us new perspectives.

"My deepest condolences for your family’s loss. That was ringing hollow before I even finished typing it. I can’t imagine the hell you are all going through right now. I’m so sorry. 

And you’re correct: there were undoubtedly other factors involved, but the Bitcoin loss should not be taken lightly. It was most likely the biggest factor. 

I made some astoundingly bad investment choices during the dot-com era. I didn’t lose a ton of money, but the rise of cheap, online brokerages, combined with the stupidity that often accompanies the mid-20s and the sudden influx of disposable income with a side of too much free time thrown in—it was a recipe for prime-cut FUBAR.

I made so many stupid decisions in such a short period of time that I was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal after recounting  the tale in some investment forum that probably went under along with most of the companies into which I bought stock. 

I said that to say this: I beat myself up over those losses. For a long time. To even attempt to extrapolate my experience to the exponential hell your brother must have gone through—it makes me nauseous.  

Everyone should read and take to heart what you so courageously posted during this time of acute grief. 

Your brother wasn’t the first to feel the hopelessness of losing the equivalent of a goldmine because of the unprecedented rise of crypto currency . And he won’t be the last. I don’t know what the answer to this burgeoning mental health crisis will be. 

People will have to learn perspective. They will have to learn to forgive themselves. As a society, the Bitcoin age is unlike anything in recorded history. The highs are stratospheric, and the accompanying excitement is hypnotic.

The other side of the coin, however—and please take no offense at that pun—is your brother. The grief. The guilt. The unforgiving pain of the never-will-be, both in riches and in life. 

For the sake of our collective sanity and for the utility of digital currency, Bitcoin and its brethren need to find some sort of stability. This volatility is dangerous.

"OK, throwaway for obvious reasons. My Bitcoin story:

I came across Bitcoin at the end of 2009, just when I came back from failed PhD studies abroad (had to change the project 2 years in) with severe depression and lifelong suicidal tendencies. Had some savings in my account, nothing major, but started considering buying BTC. Problem was that I was unable to see any future for myself (even though I was in good health and in a relationship), though unemployed and depressed. Ended up using the money to have a celebration for my marriage and burned through the rest of the savings until some freelancing gigs started paying of. At some point suicidal drive became too strong, and while wife was out of the  country on a business trip, I sat drunk in a shower with a knife, contemplating the details of how to convincingly invite my friend, so that he would come over in the morning and discover my body (didn't want my wife to go through that ordeal). But something snapped. I put the knife down and went to bed. Turns out wife got prego a week before. So we had a daughter. I started teaching in uni and once our finances stabilized a little bit, that we didn't have to live paycheck to paycheck, I started buying BTC. I started buying last summer. Ended up with a little over 1 BTC. If I compare this one BTC with couple of thousands that I might have bought back in 2009, I might feel depressed, but on the other hand, know that I have escaped depression with my life (probably would have killed myself if I were alone, even with thousands of BTC), and still managed to get some BTC, before its price got out of my range. My base salary in university as a lecturer is ~600eu, so it's not that I can afford 10k coins any time soon. But on the other hand, for me there is no huge difference between 100M or more in fiat - I will hodl and this one BTC will become the bedrock of my future generations to come :) ";16;2;False;152qq;dqsixae;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I'm sorry for your loss. Depression is hell. I'm reminded of something my ex once told me, who has always suffered from it. We were talking about drugs, and whether we would ever take one kind or the other. She told me that she would never dare to take ecstasy, or any other sorts of uppers, despite knowing that it might help her feel happy for a few hours. Her reason was that she feared the crash that would followed the high, which she had heard would put her further down than she had been before, even if that would eventually go away. She feared what she might do.

The high that your brother must have felt from the thought of soon being rich, and taking care of himself and his loved ones, must have been just incredible. And if he was struggling with depression at the same time, which some of the commenters here suspect, I cannot immagine how far down he fell emotionally, when that one bright thought got taken away.

If he did suffer from depression, your brother might have thought, mistakenly, that bitcoin was his one way out of his misery. In his place, I know I would get consumed by the idea of getting rich. I'm already checking the price several times a day to know how my measly ~0.05 Bitcoin are doing. If I then imagine adding in a depression that takes away all joy, the thought of losing that hope is truly crushing. I hope that you get what I'm trying to say, and that it actually applies here and helps to explain his passing in some sense.";9;0;False;HugeMongoose;dqsg3gx;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

Others: Life is not a contest.  Don't measure yourself against others.  Lead a life worth living by doing the best for yourself and attempting to help others (while not interfering with their own personal development and journey).

If the bottom drops out, try to become passionate about something else and perhaps help others learn from your mistakes.  That would be a much better option than resigning, and could lead to an even more ""successful"" life.  Being ""rich"" does not imply denomination in dollars.

"As someone who hates Bitcoin and saw this on /r/all --

Bitcoin didn't cause this. 

You _did_ miss out on $50M. I assume you were alive and had computer access in 2009. You could've mined then, or bought Bitcoin when it was dirt cheap. You could be a multimillionaire.

You missed out on Google stock when it was $130, now that it sells at $1k. Or Apple stock when it was $12 and is now worth $170. All of that was around the same time frame. 

But a healthy mind _doesn't dwell on these things_. You kick yourself, then you move on, knowing that you're not a psychic and that's life. You go to work. You go to the movies. You hug your loved ones. You get mad at your football team for losing. You grab dinner with some friends. Life moves on. It's not something you fixate on.

Your brother had a disease, a disease that forced him to fixate on this fantasy life instead of engaging in the good of his real life. And it's a disease that's a bitch to cure. You can't just get a round of antibiotics and call it a day. It's often not even obvious that it is a disease. It's not like a broken leg that can be diagnosed with an x-ray. Everyone gets sad, right?

I'm sorry for your loss. And as for ""I don't really know how to feel about this"", I'm not going to tell you how to feel. Because this really fucking sucks. And you're going to mourn, and you're going to feel confused and conflicted and maybe a little betrayed, and you're going to cry and miss him constantly until eventually you figure out how to breathe again.

There isn't much anyone can say to cure your pain. All I can say is that, right now, you're in the worst of it. So be gentle with yourself. The pain of loss will never really go away - but someday, instead of mourning his death, you'll be able to smile at your good memories of him again.

"Sorry to hear that. My uncle hung himself a few years ago. He left behind a wife and two children. They were financially broke, but he was too proud to ask for money from family so he would do the odd jobs. 

One day he offered to paint our house interior for $800, to help me. There I was waiting for him all day long, but he never arrived. My aunt called to see how we were doing with the painting and then I realized something was wrong. I drove from my house to theirs, and sure enough his car was parked by the side of the highway. 

I stopped, investigated and found a path into the forest nearby. There he was in a clearing, hanging from a tree branch, face blue, tongue out, eyes open. 

Of course you don't want to blame anyone in such a situation except the self-induced suicide victim, but one of his children, his son is probably the cause of it. He kept stealing what little money they had to buy drugs, gamble, etc. Got so bad, they didn't have money at times to buy their little daughter school clothes. My uncle must have snapped. 

Now that he's been gone a few years, it has become apparent that his now single wife, my aunt is also a loser. Can't even hold a job. Only the daughter is capable of work and semi-self sufficiency. The son is even worse. They both beg for money from their youngest family member, and from me on a regular basis. No shame, no motivation, no worth. 

Fuck that shit. I've cut them off for the most part but I have to stay somewhat close to make sure they don't end up proxy-killing my little cousin, like they killed my uncle. She's been depressed ever since her dad offed himself.

"I am incredibly sorry to hear about your brother. My father killed himself and losing a loved one to suicide is unlike any other loss. I have no comment on Bitcoin’s role in this aside from it is common to want to place blame when you lose someone to suicide because you want to make sense of their death. The blame may be warranted, to a certain degree, but you may over time find that the blame shifts, that you continuously try to reconcile their death and answer unanswerable questions in an effort to find closure. 

My recommendation to you and your family is not to focus on Bitcoin or the reasons why but to focus on post-vention. Join a Survivors of Suicide Loss group, get therapy, if your parents found him then their risk for PTSD is extremely extremely high and early intervention will result in the best outcomes. I suffered from PTSD for years after my dad’s suicide and you can’t outrun that shit, it’ll just pull you down. Imaginal therapy can be an effective treatment for PTSD, I’ve found success in it myself and I started it with little hope that it would work. I don’t know you but my heart hurts for you and your family. I wish you the best.

"I know what you mean, your brother sounds a little like me. I first started collecting BTC last year when the price was around $600 using faucets. However, even though the price has increased by almost 20 times, I still can't help but feel like I missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity by not entering the Bitcoin scene back in 2011 or 2012. I first bought some BTC earlier this month, but even right now, I still keep thinking: Heck, even if BTC rises to a value of $100,000, it's only a tenfold profit; I'll never manage to live a luxurious life with such returns. I don't know what hurts more: having thousands of BTC only to lose it all, like what happened to your brother, or never having that much. It's unbelievable how much money, or rather lust for money itself can destroy you from within. Luckily, I have positive thoughts most of the time; after all, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are untapped sources of wealth yet to be discovered. And not only that, but they have the power to change the world by banking the unbanked. That image of hope and prosperity for all, not just me, is what is on my mind.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I feel like I've gone a little off-topic. Forgive me, I tend to do that when I'm emotional. My condolences to you and your family, and I agree especially with the last paragraph of yours.

1st and most important for life :  simply don't blame yourself on things you can't control like future. Take decisions on the criteria of present and learn from your mistakes.   Life is much more important than money and consumables, if bitcoin becomes more important, then you know you need to rectify things.

2nd for finance: it seems that HODL is the golden rule for crypto that has less regret.

I'm going to be the minority comment in this thread but to be honest with you man, dead serious, bitcoin had nothing to do with your brother's mental health and suicide, had it been bitcoin, a girl, a bully, whatever you name it, he probably would have killed himself even if bitcoin never existed, how do I know this? in 2011 my best friend from high school and I mined and bought 45,000 bitcoin only to sell everything for $2 each when it went from $13 to $2 literally within hours. I am living one the happiest lives that I can and I don't fret about what could have been, many of us are in the same boat but fuck dude, I would choose life over half a billion bucks 100% of the time without a single hesitation whatsoever. ;3;2;False;Ascends;dqsis2x;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

">there are endless economic opportunities in life

This is so true, and true of more than money. Your brother lost a lot more than $50 million, in both money and life experiences.

I've had 2 close family members die of suicide in the last 2 years, and the worst part about it, after the funerals are done and the dust settles and we get through our survivor's guilt (or at least learn to recognize and live life in spite of it), is not knowing *why*. We want to have resolution and know why they chose to leave. In the case of my relatives, mental health problems were definitely the causes. I strongly believe that no person who is in their right mind can take their own life. People die of suicide, they don't commit it (at least not in their full minds or with their full capacity to make decisions). We may not always know the *why* in this life, but I believe we can see them again after we die and be given a clear view of their minds and their feelings and experiences.

Your brother died because his brain's life preserver malfunctioned. It's like his heart or his liver or his stomach failed, but it's harder for us to internalize because the problem was instead with the organ they used to express their souls and manifest their identities.

I hope you and your family can find peace and grow closer to each other and to your brother because of this tragedy.

"I almost ruined my family's future.

I bought 10 bitcoin before it all hit 4k. It was essentially 60% of my family's savings.

I also just bought a trezor, and had moved all my crypto onto it.

I had written down my seed-phrase and was going about memorizing it. I - moronically - used the sheet of paper as a bookmark in a book that I was taking literally everywhere I would have time to read.

On a trip out of state with my family for a friend's wedding, I lost the book at some airport.

The entire weekend was a silent hell. Every second would be an eternity of my wondering if I ruined my family's future.

The instant my mind would finally stop thinking about it, suddenly a crushing reminder of my fuck-up would make me want to vomit.

I didn't want to tell everyone that I might've ruined our future, but everyone could tell that I was devastated.

I told my wife, who, for as much shit as this community gives wives, told me that it wasn't a big deal, and that we would just have to work hard to secure our future if it were all gone. There's a special place in heaven for a woman like this.

Every time I looked at my phone I was reminded of my devastation - I had numerous Bitcoin-related apps on my phone.

The weekend is one I will NEVER forget. It was the worst weekend of my life, even though it should have been a fun one.

Luckily, the money was never stolen, I switched all the money onto a new wallet and we're living great.

"Oh my god.. I really understand that loosing the opportunity of having like 6-15k BTC while it's +10k$/BTC is something that would make me mad as fuck too,.. but that this would make him so much trouble that he kill himself is way too much.   

I mean.. it's just money. Everything is like always, just that you won't have the easy way of life. It sucks in 24 different dimensions, but well.. it's a partial gamble with BTC.  

I could buy tons of BTC back when it was like ~10$ too, but I didn't (mostly because I was poor that days, but also I was too scared) and todays I am banging my head to the wall. There is nothing much that I would make different in my life, but maybe this one little difference.  

Who knows maybe it would get hacked or I would lost the details? Maybe it's fate? I know some BTC adresses that contain BTC worth millions in it and I see how they probally got hacked and now systematically get moved around in the hope that you can't follow them back.. and I wish there was a method to hack them, but there isn't.   

I see other people becoming millionairs with BTC.. literally spending their BTC to charity, because they have more than enough.. yes, it's a inner pain, mixed with envy.  

Still I live my life like always. I go to work, come home and have fun in my free time.  

Also I give my best to find a method to earn BTC somehow :O

"[Ronald Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne) was brought on by the two Steves early on (1976) to handle some administrative work. He ultimately divested only two weeks into Apple's existence, selling his 10% stake for $800 and signing an agreement to hold no further claims on the company for a further $1500. In total, he received about $10,000 in today's money.

Had he retained his shares, as of March 2017 they would have been worth $75.5 billion USD.

I tried to buy $30 of BTC back in 2014 and after an argument with a bank (I was using BitQuick), I ultimately gave up. Obviously that's way different than owning several million shares in Apple in the early days or several thousand Bitcoin pre-Gox, but the same principle applies.

[One of my favorite Vsauce videos talks about this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ) Micheal talks about how a monk who was copying hymnals used whatever unused books he could get his hands on. With our technology, we were able to view the contents of one of the books he copied over...[a previously unknown work of Archimedes that conceived the groundwork for calculus over a thousand years before Newton and Leibniz were even born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Method_of_Mechanical_Theorems). He also mentions that an English soldier in World War I named Henry Tandey at one point saw a wounded German solider through his sights, but opted to take pity on him and didn't shoot him. That German soldier's name? Adolf Hitler.

None of us can see the future. All we can ever hope to do is try to make the right choices with the information we have available and move forward. We're all gonna screw up along the way, but we can't let our failures define who we are.

Your brother's obsession over easy money and being rich did him in. When you are a money worshipping ultra-consumerist then your life is gonna suck no matter what.

Bitcoin is supposed to give you freedom, if you end up obsessing over numbers on coinmarktcap or your wallet or your bank account, there's nobody to blame but yourself.

"I'm really sorry for your loss. It sounds like he was sad about a lot of things if the ""what if"" of Bitcoin got him down.

Truth is, all our lives are ""what ifs"" that had we known the future, everything could be different! My buddy had almost 1000 shares of Apple @ $11/sh. Had he left them until now he would be set for life x100. But he did what normal people do ... sold some when it doubled - ""no way it can go higher!"" ... sold some more at 400% return - ""this is crazy it has got to be the top"" ... rinse and repeat. Bottom line, he had no idea. He could have also bought shares of a Internet bust which would be worth nada, so you never know. Hell, I looked at my wallet recently and I definitely bought and sold 50+ Bitcoin in 2013. But I don't regret that, I enjoyed my choices.

I think that is because I learned that lesson when I was young, and maybe the story can help someone else get some perspective. Anyways, here it is :

I worked in a hotel as the maintenance dude in college. I often set up tables and chairs and stuff for events in the big meeting rooms. One day I was finishing up in the big room and this middle aged, overweight, semi balding, okay dressed guy walks in pulling one of those rolling briefcases with him. You know, the ones that just scream: ""this thing is full of crap that will NOT make you instantly rich."" I kid, I kid, but it was kind of a not super professional look. He greets me and is really friendly so we get talking. After I bring up graduation and my potential 1st job, he talks about one of his first jobs in the 80s. Tells me he was working with computers, blah blah, and was approached by a couple of guys about to go out on their own who could use someone like him. They couldn't pay much, definitely less than his current pay, but would offer him a big chunk (1/3 I think? I don't recall) of the company to compensate. Obviously not worth shit ATM but yea, that was the deal. Their grand idea? They wanted to sell Internet to the masses by giving away free CDs with it pre-loaded. Haha, what? People are just going to load up this CD and sign up for the Internet? Are they stupid? It's free! And so this guy declined their offer. 

WHAT IF he joined them, who knows, maybe things would have been different? WHAT IF the company would be great or maybe it would go bust? WHAT IF he had owned 1/3 of this silly Internet on the CD company? He claimed he would have hundreds of millions right now, billions even. He'd certainly not be setting up for a sales meeting at a Best Western in East Bumfuck, CT, that much he knew.

He told me not to live by what ifs. He told me not to yearn for the past and not to dwell on decisions you simply cannot change. Use them to grow and learn and do better. At this point I think this dude is weird and have no idea what he was talking about. He very well could be completely full of shit, but the story seemed genuine and if he was making it up, he certainly had the emotional part of it down. He claimed to be content with his life and the choices he made, which was hopeful, and again seemed genuine. And i was really happy to hear that, because as we departed ways, he said you know that silly Internet CD company. ..

Money isn’t everything. My fam lost 75% of their net worth in 2009 due to the GFC. I would have inherited £1million on my 23rd birthday (i’m 24 now).

I know why did your brother did it. Point is... Mass adoption of btc will lead to mass starving and hyperinlation. World econony will colapse. Price will surely go to miliony of dollars but thanks to hyperinflation. Workers will abandon factories and you will not buy tesla, mansions... You will buy what is left in posteconomicapocalypseworld... Only solution how to win in this is instant switch to stoneage era. Buy a flight ticket and go to africa tribal or jungle and life without money. Who is smart will realize this. Only three possibilities. 1) life in posapocaliptic world in developed countries and slowly die in hyperinflation which is already going on in eu and usa. 2) live like 10000years ago on lonely place on earth and wait when someone with better technology will kill you. 3);-4;2;False;;dqshhyc;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I lost 5000 bitcoins myself in bitcoinica. I never contemplated suicide but was quite depressed by this and can easilly understand those who are.

There is a french guy that lost his bitcoins in a scam, and it got him very depressed and suicided afterwards. This is really tragic.

If you lost a huge amount I can guarantee you that  after a while things can go better but it can literally take years to swallow a huge loss, whatever the reason. It is especially hard with the never ending rise of the value of cryptocurrencies.

Strangely out of all the advice the one that worked the best for me was accepting that it was my fault, I kept putting the blame on Zhou tong and amir taaki, but then somehow when I shifted the narrative in my head that all this loss was my responsibility it became easier to accept.";1;0;False;DarkEmi;dqsqhi3;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"I initially had 10 BTC at 2013. Lost in gambling.

Between years 2014-2016 I lost even more over 100BTC again on gambling (around 40k USD, bought at 200-400). 

Total loss is all BTC investment plus yearly income.

I stopped gambling. I have kids, wife and good job. Still strugging with depression and regret. It's just .. money/btc.

"I'm sorry for your loss (and your family's loss). While I haven't gotten near to that point, I have faced bouts of depression over losing out on ""being rich"" from all the coins I had stolen in the past. And now that I'm unemployed and we need to buy a new car, getting rid of my final bitcoin to pay for it is proving to be pretty difficult. 

But in the end, I may not be monetarily rich, but I do have an awesome wife and some awesome little girls who make life incredible. It's unfortunate your brother won't have a chance at that, but hopefully your story can help prevent anyone else from losing perspective on what's most important in life.

"Throwaway for reasons. 

I used to play a mmorpg with a friend who was a network admin or something. He was taking care of servers. All day long servers. He had a lot of free time and free storage and stuff so he used to host our teamspeak server, our forums and so on. He starting blabbing on irc about bitcoin and trying to explain it to us and what it did and so on. No one cared. Literally no one. We were talking a lot and he bugged me so much that I loaned him something around 1000euros and he told me he'd give me bitcoins as collateral(I think we calculated btc at around 2-3$). He made a wallet, address, whatever and kept it there. The deal was that if btc didn't go up in price I'd give him back the btc and he'd give me the money as soon as he had it. Dude used the money I gave him and other money he had to start selling old hardware he had from work(hdd and network gear) for btc and then started hosting other team speak servers and forums in return for btc. I sold the btc at around 11-13$ and then invested again because he kept talking about it and sold in the 20-29$ range. I wasn't interested because I didn't need any hosting, you couldn't get anything in Europe with BTC, my bank was curious about the money, I didn't understand btc at all and how it had any value and buying it, holding it etc required some work which was a problem for me. The price went up and down like crazy. I was just thinking it was something novelty and people would be bored so I was happy to make some money out of it.

I stopped playing the game and we just talked once every few months to see how we're doing. When BTC hit 1000$ I talked to him and he told me that things were really fine, he had bought homes and cars for his family, he was doing a lot of BTC related stuff and kept telling me that even at 1000$ it wasn't too late. Prices dropped soon after and I lost interest again thinking it was going to die for sure. 

Over the years I kept thinking ""what if"" especially when I saw pics of the range rover he had bought for his dad or some news article that talked about new highs in the price...but always I said ""this will die soon, people will lose money, look how much X and Y scammed, etc"" I never saw it as a possible investment.. Sometimes I feel like shit. It felt especially bad when I saw that some BTC I got on reddit and left in a wallet(0.025 that was around 5$ a few years ago) is close to 300$ now. My life could have been different but i had no way to see how things would evolve as I did not see any potential in the idea. 

Some people did and I feel happy for them. I do not think about it too much. I am terribly sorry for people that have suffered because of this, but it really isn't worth wasting time thinking about missing opportunities, learn from it and move on.

Honestly, I'd look into it.  No suicide note is a rare thing bc of the stigma that anyone who commits suicide thinks about first.  If he had 6000 btc, and he felt so horrible about losing it, one would think he made a few dollars off of it and then bought more.  Price skyrockets right now and he turns up dead with no one knowing where his btc are?  IDK maybe I'm just stirring the pot and you'd feel better not to think about it.

Agreed. If money is usefully for anything other than bare necessities, (rent, food, clothing, education) it's useful in taking care of those around you. I get so bored so quickly with the trinkets I buy for myself, but when I buy something useful for a loved one, I'm so much more happy. While I'm a complete free market individual who believes less government control is better, I think a personal goal of contentment and more posts promoting less greed will not only encourage an environment where bitcoin is a useful tool rather than a get quick rich scheme, but also prevent tragedies such as this from happening too frequently. ;2;0;False;chaoyantime;dqtkb4b;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"> Im hoping ether will take off

Ethereum already ""took off"" (at least price wise) this year. It's at 1/4 of Bitcoin's market cap for god's sake. You really shouldn't compare prices of single units of which there can be arbitrarily many.

To be fair, I wouldn't say you did anything foolish whatsoever. Bitcoin exploding was an incredibly unnatural occurrence imo. I don't think any knowledgeable investor would have predicted beyond a shadow of a doubt that bitcoin would do a fraction of how well it did. Selling bitcoin early on when it initially started doing well would have been a wise decision given the circumstances. Refusing to sell bitcoin during that time for hope of making a greater profit would have been a dream rather than a plan, a dream that beyond all comprehension just so happened to come true. Penalizing yourself for selling early is kind of like watching the news and seeing a story about a treasure chest that had been buried in the backyard of your childhood home, then penalizing yourself for not knowing: the riches were RIGHT THERE, but how on earth could you have known? You couldn't have, and you shouldn't have, because it's ridiculous. It wasn't bad luck that kept you from getting the riches, it was someone else's good luck.;2;1;False;Goose-Bone;dqsvs4v;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

Hindsight is always 20-20 and it’s easy to beat yourself up over missed or squandered opportunities. We all have them!  But let me give you a possible word of encouragement here. Ronnie Moas said the real miracle isn’t that bitcoin got from 1k to 10k this year. The real miracle was for bitcoin to go from 0 to $100.  Getting to 400k will be nothing. The real miracle is behind us.  Massive growth is yet ahead and will come easy. So then, there’s still a long long way to go. And plenty of opportunity.

I have had a bad few years myself gambling heavily, upswings in fortune to the point where I was making more money most months than friends in high paying jobs got in a year ust by playing online slots...then the greed takes over and your wasting thousands a day for a few months never cashing out.

Now I'm back on a good path, taken up an extra job so I can earn a decent wage, have a lovely partner who I'm going to move countries for when I have saved enough, I'm happy for the first time in ages. Recently had a holiday with her, didn't get to do anything fancy, travelling around Italy, she's a PhD student and I was just poor but I know I was having a better time and better memories than the rich people I passed eating in a restaurant where they paid 200 euros for a plate of food whilst looking at each other with contempt. One month when gambling I was up over £100,000...that's a fuck lot of money for gambling, didn't make me happy though or get any use.

You can always regret things in life but ultimately live one day at a time, one moment at a time. You need to accept hardships sometimes, and you can always move forwards if you don't look back, who knows what awaits you.

"> I read Satoshi’s white paper in 2010 and took a look at the source code. As a developer myself I thought to myself “Wow that’s a genius idea!” I started trying to get my computer’s GPU to start mining that day and tinkered with it for a few hours. After a few hours of messing with Linux graphics drivers I stopped because I had “real work to do.” That decision ended up costing me millions looking at the price today, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve taken a lot of stock in one of Richard Branson’s quotes:

I think I eventually got around to mining some Bitcoin for fun the next year (2011) but then I sold all those for $8.

Then there were all those times I had identified really promising altcoins like NXT, Eth, and IOTA, and ended up missing their ICOs by a few hours or a few days and those were similarly insane fortunes I almost had.

But the thing is, I ended up doing OK anyways, since I finally realized that I needed to suck it up and buy some Bitcoin since I still believed in it.  You can't keep focusing on what you could have bought or mined or whatever for pennies on the dollar (or more like pennies on the $20 these days), there's still so much opportunity and I'm buying into projects I think have a lot of potential and buying Bitcoin.

"I understand his pain and I'm sorry for your loss. I have my own story of economic loss attached to bitcoin. I'll tell it here for those that would like to hear it.

I mined in college when I was studying as a method to focus on studying (GPU mining) as to reduce/prevent me from gaming. This was from about 2009-2014. I roughly 1000 BTC (to be fair I did buy some as well when they were really cheap.) In the summer 2013 I had began mining other coins, as I thought a diverse portfolio would be beneficial, so I did one of those miners that would feed into a pool and spit out whatever coin was most profitable at the time by some algorithm. 

I was able to build a nice nest egg, it contained some dead coins, but overall it would support me if I ever needed it to. Being young and able to work I chose to begin working and simply stored my cryptos on an external hard drive that I kept on a shelf in its enclosure. 

I figured waiting for bitcoin, litecoin, doge, etc to grow would be the best bet, so I hodled. I was working, and didn't need the money, and was pursuing other things at the time.

Then my Mom was diagnosed with Cancer in August('16) of last year, as I was having a budding relationship with a woman I thought I'd spend a significant amount of my life with. Well long story short on that, my Mom I would like to proudly say kicked cancer's ass, and that woman was terrible. I stayed with her for too long and was depressed nearly the entire time. Most of which I accounted to my Mom being ill and watching her go through chemotherapy and trying to help her in anyway that I could. I never disclosed to the woman, who will remain nameless, that I had a a hard drive with potentially millions of dollars on it. I like to live my life not worrying about money. So she had no clue that I had anything like that stowed away in case of anything. 

Well my Mom's insurance premiums went up and I talked to her over coffee/tea and said I could potentially cover all the medical bills without going into debt. She was excited, as her chemotherapy treatments were winding down and her energy was coming back. She was making an excellent recovery. 

After coffee I went home to find the woman I was dating cleaning. Not a big deal, I had let things get messy in my moodiness and it needed to be done. I went to grab my external hard drive off the shelf and found the enclosure had been cracked. She said she had dropped it. I attempted to plug it in, and it did not work. I took the enclosure off the drive and plugged it in to a SATA port, to no avail. I asked her to leave at this point. Our relationship never recovered and a week later we broke up. 

I had to go to my Mom and tell her that I would not be able to pay what the insurance did not cover. I fell into a depression for a few months. I quit working, and was  an inconsolable asshole to most the people around me. 

I eventually came to terms with my losses a couple months later after talking to a few of my old professors. Their advice was to take it as a measurement as to measure all my other economic successes by. They assured me my earning potential is far higher than what I had done simply as a college student trying to force himself to study instead of playing games. I still don't know if they were right, but it got me started again. I owe a great deal to those who taught and mentored me, as it got me out of my depression. 

I was deeply burned by the loss of my crypto-portfolio, and I doubt I will ever regain any of the levels that were obtained during those years. The difficulty has increased so much, that mining with my hardware would likely net a loss for quite a long time. 

I can say I have not given up on cryptos, I recently began tapping faucets to build a small portfolio. I also have determined I am going to teach, because my former teachers helped me so much and the only thing I can do to honor them would be to help and teach others. I may never be as affluent as I once could have been but I think my life will be rewarding in other ways.

Pick where you want to end up beforehand and try not to let temptations change you. Life's will is strong.

"Hey bro, I'm sorry to hear the news. I think there's more than a few people who've been where your sibling found himself. I know I did, to a lesser extent, a few years ago. 

Back in 2009-2010, I was selling on the deepweb when BTC transactions were basically a laundering scheme. I didn't know much about it, other than that it would help me sell safely on SR and BMR. 

Shortly after I'd made a few sales, both SR and BMR were siezed/went down. At the time I had maybe 600-800 coins in the accounts. I thought to myself 'Hey, I made it away without legal trouble, that's worth the price of a few bucks' and went on my merry way. Who'd have known that if I were smarter back then and kept my coins on a paper wallet, I'd be worth roughly $10 million today. 

I think about it every once in awhile, try not to dwell on it as best I can. It sucks and it's a huge blow. But, I'm okay with the life I have now and the one that could have been is so intangible that I try not to waste time on it.

There is never certainty when you find a potential opportunity,  and failure is the most likely outcome,  So never sacrifice something too valuable to sacrifice just to get an opportunity, or because you failed one chance,  but there will likely be MANY opportunities of different kinds in your lifetime,  so persistence and the ability to continue to pursue the goal after major setbacks is a NECESSARY quality for ANYONE to have in the kind of endeavor  of pursuing any worthwhile ends...

">This statement is what my follow up comment was directed at. How can you suggest that you can take a good that is now being more productively produced due to massive improvements in technology (acreage yield, automation, energy advancements, logistics improvements etc.) should be able to be predicted accurately without factoring in the effects of those productivity increases?

The CPI is a tool to measure and compare price levels across time. We aren't talking about ""predicting"" as in foretelling the future. The CPI is a measurement of the price level at a specific point in time. Given that we have the measurement (CPI number) from 1982 and the measurement from 2015 we should be able to use those measurements to accurately calculate what an item should have cost in 1982. You divide the 2015 CPI by the 1982 CPI and then multiply the product by the price of a good in 1982, which will give us the equivalent price today. This is called adjusting for inflation. 

Shadowstats is massively, massively off when we use it as a measurement of the price level. If we do this with the BLS CPI we get pretty accurate numbers. If we do this with shadowstats we get numbers that are massively off from what we know real world prices to be, meaning that shadowstats is not accurately measuring the price level over time.

I point you to the following from [econ monitor:](https://www.themaven.net/economonitor/emerging-markets/deconstructing-shadowstats-why-is-it-so-loved-by-its-followers-but-scorned-by-economists-DWhA0PwhhkOHkzTLLeCvpQ?full=1)

""For example, a can of tomato sauce that cost $.25 at Piggly Wiggly in 1982 cost $.79 at my local market in early 2015. Starting from the 1982 price, the CPI predicts that it should cost $.61 in 2015 while ShadowStats predicts that it should cost $2.64. Starting from the 2015 price and working backwards, the CPI predicts that it should have cost $.32 in 1982 while ShadowStats predicts that is should have cost $.08. Based on these calculations, we see that the CPI underestimates inflation, as measured by the Tomato Sauce Index: The ratio of the 2015 predicted price of $.61 to the 2015 actual price, $.79, is .77, an underestimate of 23 percent. The ratio of the ShadowStats prediction to the actual price is 3.32, an overstatement of 223 percent. For tuna, both indexes overestimate inflation, the CPI by 34 percent and ShadowStats by 478 percent, and so on.""

Being that we can take the CPI and calculate what prices should have been in 1982 based on the price of the same item in 2015 and get mostly accurate number yet we can not do the same with shadowstats we have proven that shadowstats is a much, much more flawed measure of the price level over time than CPI is. 

>IMO, the ""official inflation"" numbers calculations make the same mistaken assertion, likely intentionally, to take credit for low price inflation which is really more likely the result of increases in productivity than successful ""monetary policy"".

The CPI does not make assertions. It measures price level changes across time periods and doesn't make any statements or assertions as to why the price level has changed. 

None of this matters to the central point though, that shadowstats is complete bullshit. All they do is take the official CPI numbers and multiply it by a static, arbitrary factor and it's blatantly obvious. You can argue that the BLS measures price level changes incorrectly, but even if they do, that doesn't mean that shadowstats does measure it correctly. The central point of my original comment to you was about the accuracy of shadowstats, not the accuracy of the CPI, yet you have done absolutely nothing to defend the accuracy of shadowstats.

First, that is now what your linked post (by [deleted]) suggests and second, the post is an assertion not a proof.

Actually the central point was about monetary supply manipulation, see OP.  My comment in that context had to do with the effect of monetary inflation on the prices of goods and services.  So while your assertions are somewhat interesting to think about, they were more of a potshot than relevant to the discussion.

"Whatever dude. Looks like you're not changing your mind.

But your misconceptions about bitcoin are purely psychological. The comment about ""I'd feel comfortable for selling for a few BTC but not less than one"" is proof of this. The number of units of a currency you own means absolutely nothing. 1000 USD, 1306.60 AUD, 112567 yen, 0.086500 bitcoin, it's all just different ways of writing the same value. If you invested $1000 today and it turned into $10,000 in a year, it wouldn't matter it it was 1 bitcoin or 0.1 or 0.001. It's about the percentage increase.

People have been saying Bitcoin is overpriced since it went from a few cents to a dollar. Then when it reached $10. $100. $1000. I recently found a post from March 2012 full of people talking with regret about how they missed the boat, ""if only I could have known it would blow up like it did"" etc. When the price of Bitcoin was about $5.

Bitcoin is no worse for the environment than electrical cars are or anything else electrical, including the electrical signs in Times Square and Las Vegas. The premise that bitcoins are bad for the environment is premised on the assumption that they are useless and thus a *waste* of electricity. But bitcoins are an essential component of a way to decentralize immutable data-registration around the world. That's not useless. It's revolutionary and it will certainly save more electricity than it burns.

"I used Bitcoin as a cash system pretty extensively. For any purchases where I didn't keep a receipt, I used the daily average price to calculate the sale price. Hell, bitcoin.tax does that for you.

Exchange failures and hacks are a bit harder, but you can reconstruct those records easily enough, especially if you used Bitcoin as a cash system.

Altcoin trades and donations were handled natively in the tool. Those were non-issues.

If you truly don't want to file your taxes without perjuring yourself, then just send in a check for your best guess. You can file the return itself later.

Forgive me, my mistake, I just assume. I hope now maybe you have given some time to looking into how decentralised companies operate and consider the benefits of this.

That is such a grossly inaccurate statement. Take some responsibility. Track your own investments. The actual tax outcome is of course more difficult and would make sense to have a tax accountant calculate that aspect. But saying that you don't know your basis or sales price without coinbase telling you is absurd.;1;1;False;Faenicus;dqs43zo;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"Incorrect.  

The discretionary and mandatory are both noted on that .gov pie chart.  The first clue would the inclusion or exclusion of interest on the federal debt.

Gotta love the fake news budget posts from shady ass politically motivated sources being foisted off as ""facts"" by those either * a) too stupid to know they're being duped, or b) too skeezy to care if they're lying.  

Whenever you see supposed budget numbers coming from a non .gov link, always pull up the .gov numbers and then compare to figure out which specific lie is trying to be shoved up your......

All brokers give a tax report with transactions that my accountant can import.   If coinbase doesn't do the same, it will be nearly impossible for people to know exactly what they owe.    ;1;1;False;earonesty;dqs3ru4;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.
