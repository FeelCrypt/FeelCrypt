"Hi pine!
You should definitely consider donating to 
www.human-connection.org

It`s a social, knowledge, and action network.
It sort of connects a crowdmoderated, ad-free, open source social
media platform without a filtering algorithm (to avoid echo chambers) with a knowledge platform like wikipedia. 
For those who want to get into action after reading the content, there will be an action-button which guides the user from information to possible actions (institutions like greenpeace for donations etc.).

The goal is to provide sound knowledge, to stop waisting time scrolling on platforms like facebook and *get into action in the REAL WORLD.*

Here`s one of their videos: [To bee or not to bee?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpf9f7D25zE)

The network will start its alpha phase at the end of January 2018 and currently runs its crwodfunding campaign on 
[Indiegogo.com](https://igg.me/at/humanconnectionorg).

Please donate for this network with the potential to *CHANGE the WORLD* for the better.

Hi there! very well said. it is so sophisticated. but yeah you are right on that!Thank You. the thing is i noticed in US that it's a lot easier to support with this 501 c 3 structure coz its legitimate in that concept and i think they are exempted in some things in IRS. it still depends on each country. but anyways you mentioned BTRIC is it https://www.ornl.gov/btric ? i checked on it its pretty good especially on the science and discovery addressing its energy and environmental challenges. this is cool!;2;1;False;bluesupermoon;dslr9ta;"🍍 $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA.

"Absolutely. A number of studies have demonstrated it's huge potential in being a life-saver for people suffering with PTSD.  The trouble is, no one wants to fund the trials.  It's essentially taboo.  That is why the Pineapple Fund's support, and **a commitment to match funds** is huge!  We can all support this work that is very difficult to get funded through NIH grants, etc.

I know a few people who suffer from PTSD, some worse than others.  You can feel so helpless when they are triggered.  The people I know are on various treatments (SSRIs and the like) but none of them seem to be totally effective.  In my experience, it's reduced the number of episodes, but does nothing for their severity.  I am going to be following this work closely.";1;0;False;BTRIC;dsminzp;"🍍 $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA. Pineapple Fund is matching MAPS donations 1:1.

"No that is part of the U.S. government (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), though you're right it is very cool!  Innovations in building technology is important as we try to raise the standards of living for people across the world.

No, the BTRIC that we are building is called Blockchain Technology Research Innovations Corporation (https://www.btric.org).  We are a 501(c)(3) that focuses on incubating emerging technology projects, such as blockchain distributed ledger, cryptocurrency, IoT, etc.  How we work is we accept a project into our program, provide it with the resources (team members, funding, infrastructure) it needs to develop its product or service, and then we prepare it to be separated as an independent business.  We have plans to do so for three projects at the present, and we'll be accepting more after our launch fundraiser is completed.

The three projects we're incubating at this time are one code named ""Cryptocurrency for Good"", which is a way to increase the use of crypto among non-profit organizations by accepting donations for any U.S. based 501(c)(3) public charity and then remitting those funds to the charity **as Bitcoin.**  We are going to form a partnership with one of the exchanges in the U.S. that can offer a streamlined path to onboard those charities into their own accounts so they can use and/or convert to fiat their donations, but the focus is getting crypto transactions out to a wider group of people, to help the process of mainstream acceptance.

The second project we're incubating is a project related to seafood traceability, which is a major problem in the U.S.  The government regulators, NOAA Fisheries, have mandated a system be put in place in certain types of seafood, and it's expected to broaden over time, as you can see here: (http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/taskforce.html).  This project will enable tracking of seafood from the point of harvest (wild-capture or farmed) or the point of importation all the way through to the end consumer.  Through a special purpose blockchain, parties that deal with this seafood (some of which has been done fraudulently) will have a trustless system to verify the chain of custody.  It will help the marketplace because domestic producers will not have to compete against ""shady"" sources that may have cheated the system.  When this project is done being incubated, it will be divested from BTRIC as a separate for-profit business.

The third project we are working on right now is code named ""Cryptocurrency Federal Credit Union"", and its purpose is to survey the cryptocurrency and emerging technology industry, businesses and users, and determine if sufficient interest exists to apply for a federal credit union charter from the NCUA.  As said, the first step in that process is to conduct a statistically valid survey.  If the results are positive, then you can move on into the chartering process.  I believe that people and businesses that transact in fiat/crypto face large challenges in dealing with financial institutions and that a **member-owned** federal credit union could provide real benefits to the community.  It would, of course, specialize in the type of transactions that many banks and other financial institutions run away from because of the high burden of anti-money laundering/economic sanctions/financing of terrorism compliance that is necessary.  It will also allow new businesses in the ecosystem to get up and running with a reliable partner for their checking, savings, debit card, ACH, etc.  Though the eventual goal is to replace these financial institutions, ""bridge institutions"" will be needed for some time, and this project proposes to create such an institution that would be owned and governed by its account holders, as all with an account are members of a non-profit credit union.  So the goal for divesting this is to do so as a non-profit federal credit union.

That's what BTRIC is working to make a reality.  The larger issue, about 501(c)(3) structure with for-profit subsidiaries, is something that BTRIC also wants to promote through what we call ""BTRIC Institute"", our advocacy and outreach initiative.  Fact is, regulation will happen in the crypto space.  It's better to shape it, instead of being shaped by it.  Coin Center is doing work in this area, and we want to bolster their efforts.

Everything BTRIC does is open-source (MIT) and/or open-licensed (Creative Commons), so the work we do can be adapted/remixed/used for everyone in the ecosystem.

Thanks for your interest in BTRIC, I appreciate it!

Sorry, I was just having a rough day.. the reason why that's not true is that the algorithms are different. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, and ethereum uses ethash. Ethash is a much more memory intensive algorithm than SHA-256, so it's currently prohibitively expensive to design and produce ASICS that hash it. It's possible, but the performance gains would be very tame indeed in comparison to the gains you get when you upgrade from cpu to ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) SHA-256 machines. So Asics exist for sha-256 and hash super super fast, and Asics don't exist for eth and even if they did, they wouldn't get as many hashes per second as the BTC ones, not even close. Gpus mine eth, machines that are literally not capable of anything else mine BTC.;4;1;False;BifocalComb;dsmjayi;The Colonel of KFC weighs in on alt-coins;7pzvht;https://i.imgur.com/gVmFbMV.png
