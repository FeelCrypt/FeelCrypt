Gotcha. I don't really have a problem with cryptocurrency (I'm invested in it), I just have my doubts about the usability of Bitcoin in particular for transactions and see a lot of value in the current system. If I had to guess, I would say these wild west cryptocurrencies will mostly be secluded to black markets.

"no they won't. 

First they can't test if it's pure very easily. If they can't buy an ounce known to be good it will be treated as scrap and go in with their scrap and go to the refiner. The refiner pays them much less than market price for gold because they have to do work. 

Goldsmiths have a legal responsibility to meet purity standards, what is stamped on their work. 

For this reason it's a big headache. Why should I buy your crap off the street instead of just buying my gold nice and pure in ingot form, from a reliable supplier.

Oh, here is one reason why...

Because I got it well below market price from you.

Now, about the buy and sell, there are market makers and jewellers are not them. Market maker will buy from you at the low price and sell at the high price. He holds onto inventory. 

If you sell to a jeweller you're going to have to undercut the market maker substantially. In the end, you're better off selling to a refiner, or else just keeping your gold intact and selling to someone else like you who wants gold. 

Then you can meet in the middle and cut the market maker out.

"Reversibility [can be used to scam too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Merchants_2). It doesn't make sense to integrate it into the payment system. 

If you're buying from a brick and mortar store, then there's already a legal system in place to protect the consumer even if they pay with cash. Adding the possibility of chargebacks just increases costs. The goods they're giving me are irreversible, why shouldn't the money I'm giving them be irreversible too? Where they're allowed to do so, many businesses offer a cash discount.

If you're buying from some rando on the internet, then you can use escrow (like OpenBazaar) to protect you from fraud. You can select a big business like the credit card companies as the escrow, but also anyone else. The choice of escrow isn't tied to the payment system itself. If I'm buying MP3s and I want 1000 purchases over a year, then I don't need any consumer protection at all.

"**Polymer banknote**

Polymer banknotes are banknotes made from a polymer such as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Such notes incorporate many security features not available in paper banknotes, including the use of metameric inks. Polymer banknotes last significantly longer than paper notes, causing a decrease in environmental impact and a reduced cost of production and replacement. Modern polymer banknotes were first developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and The University of Melbourne.

"**Monetary inflation**

Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area). Depending on many factors, especially public expectations, the fundamental state and development of the economy, and the transmission mechanism, it is likely to result in price inflation, which is usually just called ""inflation"", which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services.

There is general agreement among economists that there is a causal relationship between monetary inflation and price inflation. But there is neither a common view about the exact theoretical mechanisms and relationships, nor about how to accurately measure it.

"> And what would that be exactly?

From Satoshi's White Paper:

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash

I am not the peer of an exchange. I am not the peer of a large mining operation. In fact, with the wallet apps on my smart phone, I'm not even the peer of someone operating a full wallet node. As a casual user, I am subservient to and dependent upon all of these entities.

> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

In theory you trust the blockchain and pay little to no fees. In reality you have to trust the developers, the miners, and (for many of us) the exchanges and we've reached a state where the fees are getting ridiculous for many users and transaction times are too long to be useful to many users.

> privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous

> a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner

Casual users are not informed of this if they do something like download a wallet app into a smart phone and start transacting with other bitcoin users. Lay the blame where you want but, with a public ledgering system and how things are introduced to casual users, there's little to no real way they could have any expectation of privacy.

These are the failures of claims directly stated in the White Paper.

Then, there are the things that were claimed by bitcoin enthusiasts when I started learning about bitcoin. Things like:

* It will provide cheap banking services to the 3rd world not currently served by financial institutions
* It will make national currencies less important
* It will cost less in fees than traditional financial institutions
* Transactions will be validated quickly enough to facilitate the sales of goods and services like a cup of coffee at a coffee stand

As far as I can tell, none of those claims are coming true.

I don't know what bitcoin will become but I do know that it currently is not a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash that allows two parties to transact with each other without having to trust a third party- not for most users any way. The developers and the big mining operations control the block chain. Most of us are beholden to an exchange to get bitcoins. The fees are outrageous. Transaction times are too slow. Maintaining privacy is not promoted for casual users. Most users are not peers but are little guys dependent on the big guys to get their transactions into the blockchain.

Bitcoin is probably the NCSA Mosaic v1.0 of cryptocurrencies. A brilliant idea with lots of unintended uses and side effects. Remember HTML was supposed to forgo presentation and only be worried about content. How quaint does that notion that seem in today's world?

We'll probably see the emergence of a Netscape Navigator-ish or Internet Explorer-ish version of cryptocurrency in the not too distant future. And just like those 2nd generation browsers had their life span in the evolution of the web, they will also probably be outpaced later by cryptocurrencies that are more adept at being used how cryptocurrencies end up being used- which at the moment seems like bitcoin is primarily used as a rapidly inflating investment commodity. Where in the White Paper is that function laid out? 

In fact, it's stupid to spend bitcoin on anything (especially real world good or services) at the moment. If the price of bitcoins continues to go up and the value of the USD, for instance, continues to remain fairly steady anything you might buy with bitcoin today you'll technically have overpaid for in a week or a month. You should instead just hold onto your bitcoins.

You know how many people, years ago, sent whole entire bitcoins around for a good that may have cost anywhere from $13 to a few hundred... That has matured to 4K now lmfao. Gl with that.

You'll feel really silly. People already do now. Yet people are still actively looking to spend it lol. Subway in Czech Republic accepts btc? I guess so...

I have seen the process, and they have a precise mixture of old levis (Yes, not just ""jeans"", specifically Levis).

It's technically still paper rather than cloth because of the process which suspends the fibers in a watery pulp, which is poured onto a porous fabric to strain away much of the liquid while the fibers settle into a flat sheet. the sheet is then transferred to a maze of rollers where the paper is further dried and pressed thinner. One of the rolls early in the process allows more fibers to settle in some places more than others which form thicker and thinner areas ""watermarks"".

Making Fabric on the other hand has traditionally meant ""woven"" although today there are many modern fabrics which are ""non-woven"", but are still usually a dry process rather than a wet one.

Also consider products like Kevlar, Tyvek and Nomex (all DuPont products) All are made from polymer (plastic). Kevlar is usually a woven fabric. Tyvek is technically a non-woven, and Nomex is technically a paper.

">> I am not the peer of an exchange.

> Nothing is stopping you from transferring bitcoin to a friend or any other peer.

You're employing a red herring logical fallacy. The original claim in the White Paper was for a ""purely peer to peer financial network"". It's not about whether I can send money to my peers. It's about whether I am joining a ""purely peer to peer financial network"". Clearly the network is not made up of purely peers but of bigger entities who use their size and influence over smaller entities.


>> and pay little to no fees.

> That's not part of Satoshi's paper. Bitcoin cannot exist long term without fees.

Your correct that it is not explicitly stated how much fees will be and it does say there will be fees. However, it seems readily apparent that unless fees are reasonable or less than traditional financial institutions bitcoin loses some of its appeal. I'm fairly confident that this is why so many early promoters of bitcoin made the claim that the fees would be less what we pay the big financial institutions now.

>> Casual users are not informed of this if they do something like download a wallet app into a smart phone and start transacting with other bitcoin users.

> This also has nothing to do with the price of one BTC

It doesn't have to be about the price in USD of one bitcoin to be relevant to the failures of the ideas laid out in the original White Paper. I was answering a question about how bitcoin is failing to live up to its original intent. The actual question was ""what was it trying to achieve"". Privacy is its own separate section in the White Paper. It would be ridiculous to not address the potentially massive privacy failure that exists for casual users these days.

>> Then, there are the things that were claimed by bitcoin enthusiasts when I started learning about bitcoin. Things like:

> That was not part of Satoshi's paper, sorry if you got mislead by early adopters.

Claiming that the goals and desires of the users of any system are less important than the goals and desires of the creators of a system is a strange position to take. Eventually, the desires of the users and promoters of most systems will become more important than those of the creators. But, when you're thinking of using or joining a system it doesn't really matter who is selling you a false bill of goods- you're still being sold a false bill of goods.
