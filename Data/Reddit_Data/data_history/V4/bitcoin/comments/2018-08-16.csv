The one thing it doesn’t do is add a ridiculously wasteful proof-of-work mechanism for who’s allowed to add transactions to the blockchain repository. Multiple examples of actually useful software branded “blockchain” turn out to be simplified versions of Git.

Interesting article, thanks for sharing it (I don't necessarily agree with it, but it's a thought-provoking piece). I like the Git vs. blockchain comparison and will read more about that.;1;0;False;BlockchainObserver;e4akuzd;Crypto Trading 2017 / 2018;972bxf;https://i.redd.it/dhzbhge9hxf11.png
