"In a market where currency is deflationary this now makes the currency a better “investment” than actual investments, which leads to people hoarding the money instead of investing in businesses and driving the economy. This had a much bigger impact than people buying phones and computers. 

It also increases the “real value” of debt. So say you borrow $1000. I could have bought 100 barrels of oil with that. I have to pay that back in a couple years, but since deflation has occurred you can now buy 140 barrels of oil so it’s actually costing me a lot more to pay off that debt (the same amount of cash but what I’m paying back is 40% more valuable than what I borrowed). In an economy where the money supply is tightly controlled and actually decreasing then your salaries will actually *go down* to keep up with deflation, instead of going up to keep up with it.

No, society wants their privacy.  They are scared into believing that cash is bad by so much propaganda that terrorists use it.  Central banks want to eliminate cash because they can charge to use a payment system and governments want to ban cash so that they can control people.

> The only reason money works is because it is regulated.

Money is a product that has value that can be exchanged: cows, salt, gold.

What you're referring to is currency.  Yes, currency must be regulated because it is a receipt for money.

Or it used to be.  Now it is merely a credit or a debit made at the whim of a central banker.

It is sold today that we should want ""transparency"" and have a cashless system because only the crooks use cash.  Who sells this idea?

Where's the $9 trillion that missing from the Fed?

Think about a world without cash.  You have NO financial privacy whatsoever.  You can't conduct business between two people without a bank.  The bank is the intermediary in all transactions and takes their bite.  The whole point of Bitcoin was to eliminate the bank and return person to person payments and some modicum of privacy.

A government can tax what it needs to pay the bills.  There is no need to know everyone's comings and goings.

You probably think that the government reading our emails and listening to our calls is OK because you have nothing to hide and we might catch some terrorists as a result.

Many of the terms you are using in regards to finance are not correct - they are changes that have been made in order to sell bad ideas.  I recommend this as a good read:

"This is a good opportunity to do the reverse of my earlier comment and go 'from the dirt to the clouds.'

Maybe the greatest thing Mindfulness teaches us is to observe our own responses and find wisdom in the question of ""why?""

Why did I do that? Why did I say that?  Why did I feel like that? What impulse was so powerful inside me that I felt the urge to come into a place of light and create darkness? 

Because whether there's empirical evidence or not, by using the practice of mindfulness to learn how to ask and answer these types of questions of yourself, you will no longer feel the need for external validation of its benefits. Good luck, friend!

PS. To find the empirical evidence you seek, of which there is actually plenty, I recommend starting by googling Jon Kabat Zinn and his studies at the University Of Massachusetts Medical Center.

Hacks would be much less profitable then. 

If exchanges started leading the way on this, I suspect others would (be forced to) follow.

"How is this not top of /r/Bitcoin. Yo, bitcoin community get your head out of your ass and stop memeing, there is serious shit going on.


Edit: Now this gained traction, I'm serious. For the past month there has been nothing but low quality memes, turning this subreddit to a circlejerk (I have made one of these shitty posts). But at a certain point we need to take this community seriously. We have the potential to connect to many people. If someone is interested in bitcoin and they stop here, only to see 1000 posts about the price on coinbase, when WE ALL FUCKING HAVE THE INTERNET, they will just see bitcoin as a meme. I think the moderators of this subreddit need to take some control. I think all posts that are a coinbase or some other ticker screenshot, should be auto deleted. There are occasions where memes are okay, but it's time we return to building this community. Saying hodl every two seconds is idiotic. Let's all grow up please.

Edit: edit: there is a post on front page with 1000 up votes all it is, is ""14k!"" with nothing of substance. Please moderators, stop letting this sub degenerate. This isn't /r/Bitcoincirclejerk. We want to have fun, but posts with any sort of meaningful conversation are being blown away by this plethora of low content bullshit.


Edit: edit: edit: because I'm high and have a podium. Why not be like other top subreddits. When a post hits /r/all a moderator should have a pre-made comment sent to the top, with an introduction to /r/Bitcoin and bitcoin in general. An faq of how to get involved and buy bitcoin. This can all be done fairly easily as I've seen it done on many subs. There are 10+ mods on this subreddit, for a community based on a currency that could reach the trillions, yet for the past month the filth on this subreddit has grown equally with the price of bitcoin. We need the great /r/Bitcoin purge and revamp of 2018.

I sold around 12,150, but put an emergency buy back higher.  I think it'll dip, but if it doesn't,  cut loss and ride up again

Also the other way. Holds at 12,200, but as soon as it goes 12,000 and South,  it'll probably lower all the way to 11,000 because people are cutting their gains from the last few days,  a trickle becomes a snowball

There were large sell orders to overcome, and after $12k was a plateau in comparison, not nearly as many.  So even if the buy orders came in a constant rate (you can argue that they would pick up after breaking a resistance barrier), you'd see something similar to what we did. ;3;0;False;TJ11240;dqu3auh;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

Because the supply dried up. Everyone who wanted to sell at 12k sold, so demand drove price up quickly.

I could be wrong but what I understand as my own thoughts about this. People were probably hoping for a dip so no reason to buy at some arbitrary 11.9k number. As it hits a milestone like 12k I am sure people panic buy as the price drastically jumps up and down and do not want to feel like they missed out if it continues to climb with the thoughts it wont come back down.;35;3;False;Meyael;dqu17uf;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

"Bitcoin is manipulated. You don't think groups are creating walls and then buying them back in the group to generate panic/interest? This has been going on with smaller cryptos ever since I can remember. An artificial run will be created with some hype around the crypto generating interest which pulls in new bag holders. As the interest rises the original runners will sell off leaving the bag with the new investors. As it was all artificial there was nothing propping the value of the coin up. Once the bag holders realize this they begin to sell off crashing the coin completely.

"If I were CEO of a big bank, I'd do whatever it took to turn my business model around to working *with* bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Probably I'd start off by becoming a regulated cryptocurrency exchange in as many jurisdictions as possible and allowing customers to have both fiat currency accounts as well as crypto accounts allowing them to easily buy/sell/trade between them in as frictionless a way as possible.

Beyond that, I'd begin looking in to other activities like acting as a large lightning node, setting up a payment processor system (competitor to bitpay, but non-sucky), and so on.

There's no reasons banks *have* to be enemies with bitcoin.

1/ A note on what's ""sensible."" This parabolic move isn't moderately sensible. It's gone far past euphoria. It's caused FOMO over and over and over again. I can tell you after I've look at most of the parabolic moves of the last 100 years, this is an entirely different beast.



2/ You have to throw out all models of what ""feels"" or is a ""normal"" time that something tops, or corrects. I am convinced that the way this thing is going to behave is going to be literally designed to make you part with your coins and completely spin you around.

3/ This little consolidation up here sent everyone bonkers, and it was near ATH most of the time. The volatility is going to kick up further and it's going to be even worse whipsaws than before. My point is, when you feel like it's going to correct or top, it probably wont.


4/ Sticking to the basic rules: euphoria is vertical wide ranging candles that cover huge ground rapidly, and bottoms are vertical decline whipsaws that create multiple long wicks are going to be the best tool to figure out where we are in the gym of the market.

"Also, where exactly does the money earned come from. If I try to think about it on simpler terms, it doesn't make any sense:

To make things a smaller scale, let's say Bitcoin is $10 a coin, and 10 people have 1 coin, which means $100 is spent total on it. From what I've gathered, the price per Bitcoin goes up every time someone buys into it. So if an 11th person buys a $10 coin, there's $110 split between 11 people , bit since someone bought in, the price would actually have gone up, say for example $1 per coin for simplicity purposes, which means 11 people get a dollar more, but WHERE does this $11 come from?

"Selling before a level in your plan is a sure fire way to get kicked out of a good trade by your auto limits, at least in real life. I'm not sure how the market making works in bitcoin on GDAX or any other coin market. Those market makers work for other companies and know where people get in and out and will literally take you to the penny of say 5% (popular get out limit) since they can stomach the loss and you can't often times. 

In the case of bitcoin and the GDAX I'm pretty sure it's all automated so unless someone is pushing the coin market with dollars that most likely wouldn't happen. 

That bidding war happens like you said but you have to remember almost all the orders you're seeing are auto-placed. buys/stops/limits and not many people give a shit about pennies on the dollar. Like I said in my first comment we're conditioned to like really round numbers.

"Institutional money is already in the bitcoin market. It's just mostly sitting on the sidelines though because of the apparent risk valuation is high for risk management schemes at banks. None of the banks are going to put more than <10 million anywhere near a crypto-currency.

There's no underlying asset, the liquidity isn't high enough for them to dump their position straight to cash (unless you get creative with markets) if they need to get out, and their executives are more interested in the block-chain than they are crypto-currencies right now. They're trying to use the block-chain in their own businesses and use it in the Dollar economy. Which is great because they have lots of money to speed that up and I'd prefer if they stay out of the crypto-markets with their 100s of billions that shove us all out eventually.

"**Gold Reserve Act**

The United States Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 required that all gold and gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve be surrendered and vested in the sole title of the United States Department of the Treasury.

The Gold Reserve Act outlawed most private possession of gold, forcing individuals to sell it to the Treasury, after which it was stored in United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox and other locations. The act also changed the nominal price of gold from $20.67 per troy ounce to $35. This price change incentivized foreign investors to export their gold to the United States, while simultaneously devaluing the U.S. dollar in an attempt to spark inflation.

I'd say the smallest practical unit is 0.25 PHP. 0.01 USD is equivalent to 0.51 PHP. Let's round that down to 0.50 PHP for convenience.

"There was a 177 bitcoin buy order that bought all the selling orders at $12,000. Then another for 100 bitcoins, and another for 72. 

This in itself isn't unusual but the speed at which they were bought/sold and all orders cleared was incredibly quick. Normally the orders are filled at a semi-consistent rate a few bitcoins at a time, sometimes large orders come in and it takes an hour for buyers/sellers to chip away at them.

Because trading is mostly psychological and humans love round numbers with lots of zeroes the $1000 increments have, for the most part, been points of resistance, where the price will bump up against the next $1000 increment then come back down, then bump up against it again before finally going above.

So a bunch of people think it's going to cap out at $12,000 or they wanted to lock in profits they already made so they set up sell orders at that level to trigger automatically. Well a bunch of other people think it's going to skyrocket beyond $12,000 so they had huge buy orders in at that price.

When that happens, in any market, it's beautiful to watch. You can just watch hundreds of millions of dollars trade hands in 2 minutes or less until finally whichever side has the most orders wins and the price breaks through or goes down again.";77;1;False;;dqu6c1e;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

"Depends on what you mean by bubble... 

Is it concerning how many people are buying without even understanding what they’re buying? Yes.

Is bitcoin overvalued? That depends on what bitcoin will become. If it is on a path to become the leading global currency, this price is a little bit of a joke. If it’s not going to enter that conversation, then yes, this feels unsustainable. I think it all comes down to whether we all get comfortable with the idea as a currency or digital gold. If you’re not making a calculated risk based around that thesis, then yes, you’re probably just gambling at this point.

"You're thinking about the commodity as a volume instead of as a surface area.  
Think of a sphere.  
The valuation of the market cap is defined by the volume but in reality its valuation at exchange is determined by surface area. If someone sells, you are cutting off a piece of the surface of the sphere, and the volume shrinks. the commodity isn't creating value (volume) it is just distributing demand along the surface of the sphere. Once more people want to sell than buy, the surface area will shrink and those people left holding will sell for much less.

So the way the market works is X number of people want to buy bitcoin, Y want to sell. The price is set by who of X want to sell at a price, and whether Y wants to buy it at that price. It's an ever flowing curve. The more people who are holding and not selling, the fewer coins are passing back and forth, which further increases the price.

All the money I have in crypto is money I don't need regardless of how much it goes up.

I knew about bitcoin when it first came out in 2009 and I thought it was really interesting. Life got in the way and I never had time to sit down and figure out mining. I could have millions now if I would have taken the time, but that doesn't bother me now. The fact is, I did go through hard financial times and was younger and dumber, so even if I would have gotten myself bitcoins when it was basically worthless I most likely wouldn't have any left today.

I’d really expect to see a ‘bidding war’ (for lack of better term) going down 1c at a time until you are ‘first’. That certainly does happen, but nowhere near the extent I would have guessed. ;5;2;False;o_oli;dquciky;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

"Let's do a little bit of (very rough) math:


I did some searching and found a rough estimate of how many people use Bitcoin worldwide. It seems to be somewhere between 4 million and 10 million. Really hard to nail that number down. But for this argument's sake, let's just go high and say 10 million.

With 10M people holding BTC, (most not spending it), and not a lot of merchants accepting BTC as payment, we could say likely less than half use it as a daily (even weekly) currency.

Now imagine in 4 years, if most major merchants now accept BTC. Walmart, Amazon, Gas Stations, car dealerships, mobile app stores, etc. Bitcoin is now as normal to use as a gift card would be. 

Right now there are about 17.5 million Bitcoin in circulation. Let's say even 10% of these are lost/destroyed/unspendable. So 16.25 million bitcoin remain.


* Currently at $12,000 USD 
* Not yet merchant friendly
* Completely unknown to the majority of the world
* Only used/owned by ~0.2% of the global population

The estimated total amount of money in circulation *globally* is 60 trillion dollars. ($60,000,000,000,000)

Say in 2022, 25% of the planet are using Bitcoin (scaling issues aside for the argument) at least as a weekly form of payment for *something*. 

The more people using it, and the more transactions going on, more coins will be lost, and also hoarded.
We already see people **only** hodling because the price is skyrocketing. Imagine what people will do when it starts approaching $100,000.

With 2 billion people, using the coin semi regularly, we have the following figures:

There will be 18m total by 2022, so that is around 0.05 Satoshi for each person (remember only 25% of the global population in this excercise).

But they aren't going to be evenly distributed, so let's apply the current percentages of wealth to this because I feel like I've rambled too much.

The average liquid worth of ""middle class"" Americans is ~$4,500. Or, 0.000000000006% of the total available money. 

Now let's be generous and say after accounting for lost coins, lifelong hodlers, and unspendable coins, the ""average"" person will have 0.0000001% of a Bitcoin.

This amount is *less than 1 Satoshi*. So again, let's be generous and round it WAY up to a whole Satoshi. 

If equate what the average person likely has, with say 1% of the liquid net worth from above (~$4,500), we have $45 == 0.00000001 BTC.

This would come out to 4.5 billion dollars per BTC, obviously that is not correct, but my likely incoherent brain vomiting hopefully shows how $4M per isn't really that insane to comprehend.

Your scam is pathetic.  Your virtual bits are worthless.  

How governments haven't stepped in and shut down this scammery that is used to launder money and buy illegal goods is beyond me.  

""Waaa, you're salty you didn't get in when it was cheap and you're mad you're not rich now!""  Had plenty of opportunity.  Didn't take it because I'm not an idiot that deals in illegal currency and recognized a fucking stupid scam when I saw one.

Every downvote means you're just crying and admitting I'm right.  How about actually replying and explaining to me how I'm wrong?  Oh, right, you can't.  I've seen all your ""arguments"" and they're bullshit.  Shut this garbage down.

Just like yesterday 1 BTC = 1 BTC and the fair value is not dictated by any central authority. Bitcoin is only worth what it can be sold for in actuality, or purchased for, in actuality. Gdax holds no monopoly on this unit, and bitcoin has been selling for over 13 000 USD for weeks in other markets. Guess bitcoin is worth less on gdax than true markets that sell to people who use bitcoin for something other than speculative day trading.;4;1;False;snowkeld;dqu3eo9;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

"**Behavioral addiction**

Behavioral addiction is a form of addiction that involves a compulsion to engage in a rewarding non-drug-related behavior – sometimes called a natural reward – despite any negative consequences to the person's physical, mental, social or financial well-being. A gene transcription factor known as ΔFosB has been identified as a necessary common factor involved in both behavioral and drug addictions, which are associated with the same set of neural adaptations in the reward system.

"There was a lot of hype when it hit 1300 in 2013. I thought the same thing. I bought some at 900 but the price kept dropping. I always thought that it would be neat to have a whole bitcoin but i couldn't afford it. Eventually I just let it go but I kept an eye on it. After a couple years of slowly dropping the price was under 300. I realized i could finally buy a whole one but because it seemed like it wouldn't recover i didn't want one anymore. If the price dropped to 1000 tomorrow a lot of people think they would buy it but being in the situation is a lot different.

I think it is good for people to buy a small amount and then just ignore it. If it tanks then you don't lose much but in ten years it might be a lot higher. If you invest too much then it'll always be a worry in the back of your mind and you'll make bad decisions. 

One thing you can do is to buy a small amount now and then don't buy anymore unless it drops to a certain price like 5000. in your mind this takes some of the stress off. If it goes up you are good but if it drops then you get a better price and get more. Just make sure to stick to your plan. Or you can try dollar cost averaging where you buy a small amount once a month no matter what the price. 

The best thing to do is to act logically and not based on the current hype and hysteria. Make sure you are aware of the risks and the emotional costs.

It could literally stay exactly the same in terms of protocol and the price could skyrocket just because of more demand. That is literally all it takes. The same can not be said for other investments such as stocks. The thesis behind bitcoin allows this whereas others do not. This is how bitcoin is able to go from $200 to $12000 (x60) for no apparent reason. If you can realize this then you can assume the price will keep going up until bitcoin no longer has demand or no more users demand it. Therefore as long as bitcoin continues to gain new users the price will go up and it is obvious that there are more and more users or demand every day as price goes up, becomes more legitimate, and risk lessons. Look in the news. Price will go up. Futures a risk due to shorting? No fucking way. Less crazy upswings? Maybe. The only reason we had a 2 year bear market is because people thought bitcoin was essentially going to fade away into nothingness. We are far beyond that point now as bitcoin has gone so far as to be mentioned in a press release by the whitehouse. This next year we are going to blow everyone's minds and bitcoin will become a household name. It truly is the bull run of the century.

Any chance you have a screen shot of that conversation?  I’m reasonably intelligent and don’t mind doing research, but most of the info I’ve seen thus far is focused on explaining what Bitcoin *is* and not so much a step-by-step how to buy and how the component parts function (I’m particularly concerned about the warnings I’ve seen regarding wallets and addresses, and this has kept me from pulling the trigger).

There was a large number of Bitcoin for sale right under or at the $12,000 price. Prominent number prices typically follow a similar pattern and act as psychological barriers. Check out GDAX and look at the depth chart to observe this. That's showing all the limit sells already on the books. You'll notice a larger number of sells to get from just under $13,000, past that price. People make market buys at the lowest available sell price on the books. Once a big price barrier is broken, like $12,000, the sales on the books start to increase faster, so the price rises faster.;1;0;False;President_Ders;dqu4kqe;Officially 12k on GDAX REJOICE!;7hux9u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hux9u/officially_12k_on_gdax_rejoice/

"If you understand it and its benefits, buy a little now. If it dips, hold, and buy a little more.

Being a long time buyer(2012-2013), I'm honestly baffled that the price is already this high. It seemed like it would never happen. With that, the price is high but the tipping point still hasn't happened and it probably won't for a long while. It's not everywhere yet... There are still many people that have no idea what it is, how it works, etc etc. 2008-2015 might've been super early days but we're still very much in the early days. 

Whether you think it's going to be an investment store of value vehicle or a world currency vehicle, it's hard to go wrong. I say that loosely. For me, I believe in the tech. I believe in the coin. 

Believing in it is one thing. The other thing is realizing the volatility. We've always seen swings and while it continues to stabilize, I still think we'll see big swings for a while. 

I'll continue buying whether it goes up or whether it dips down. It's mainly a store of value for me right now because I only use it when shopping Newegg or Overstock. There is a fast food Chinese place that takes it in my town. I do get to use it there! I can't wait until the day I can use it for almost everything.
