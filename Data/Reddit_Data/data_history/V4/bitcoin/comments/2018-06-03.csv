He gave a clue that was later erased that said, “when you’re close to home x marks the spot” at the end of the clue. Also referred to as a treasure hunt originally. But I think he erased that clue because right after he made it one step easier like deleting passphrase which is what the x or glyph marked;1;0;False;Crypto4204life;e00is39;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Ok,so because I'm out of ideas I'll just share my theory so far and maybe it will help someone.

**The words:**

So for the words I took all the z values from the picture.I was inspired by the clues and I added +1 to all the values,so for z =25 you will have the value 26.I also used the list of all mnemonic phrase words sorted alphabeticaly which you can find on google.So here is what I did:

1)I took all the mnemonic phrase words from the picture

2)I searched (ctrl+f) all of them in the list
Now with the help of the ""almost open"" clue I noticed that the position in the list of these 2 could be generated if you **PAIR** some of the z+1 values.Example: open is 1242,which can be seen as z=11 +1 paired with z=41+1

EDIT1: so because somebody asked: the z+1 values are like a list of values which can be the first or the second part of the pair,so open which is 55 you have z= 4+1,so the first part of a pair or the second one can be 5,you dont need to have z=4 twice in the pic


3)I did this rule for all the words and I got **EXACTLY** 24 matches
Here is my list of words in random order:
*come interest grow also frequent coin gold entire define code almost open law allow modify attack add air model aware agree now later access*


So this is preety much all I got this far.It might be right,it might be completly wrong,who knows? Keep in mind that english is not my first language so I might sound weird in some places.
