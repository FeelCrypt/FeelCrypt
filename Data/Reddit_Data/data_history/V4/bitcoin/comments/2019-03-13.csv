"Check out who Eliot Spitzer is.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer

He transferred arms to death squads by hiding them in ""US humanitarian aid"" to start civil wars to overthrow countries for Corporations profit.

If the US wanted Aid to go to Venezuela they could give it to the red cross. 

Instead the US imposed sanctions to starve the people and try to overthrow the democratic government. 

The last thing the ""opposition"" wants is an election monitored by the UN or Carter Center or anyone.  They would loose.  So they light fire to ""aid"" trucks in Columbia in order to gain traction for Trumps corporate coup.

Once again your AMERICAN CENTRIC idea is appalling. You think the world revolves around the united states? What about the 50 other nations who recognize Guaido? Are those all also part of the USA plot?

The opposition is neither wealthy, nor does it represent only 30% of the country. Popular Will is a member of Socialist International. It was specifically created to oppose Chavez's attempt to remove term limits and become a de-facto dictator for life (Something Maduro is revisiting). It got 2/3 of the National Assembly seats in 2015. 

Please city your source which says it is 'of the wealthy'.

You say""for the record"" and I don't see you backing up a single opinion of yours by facts.

So please, cite your source where Guaido has done anything close to murdering 9000 people. Where his supporters are wealthy.

Also please refrain from dragging the united states into this, it makes you look like a american centric gringo .

Is this another ""We just haven't tried the right kind of socialism"" arguments? I've got a good dozen memes for that if you're really into that sort of thing.

The bottom line on socialism is that it always fails because people cannot price things efficiently. Computer programs won't really be able to do so either because they're relying on human input, which is slow and flawed.

Only the free market can efficiently price anything and every single law and regulation ever written impacts free markets. Even the simple stuff like 'thou shalt not kill.'  They all do if you have a government enforcing these laws.

The problem that people have is the idea that you can pay for them by stealing the businesses in the country and running them into the ground and squeezing them dry.

It turns out that capitalism has demonstrated itself as the BEST way to get people to do more things and grow the economy.  You could argue that the growth happens in the wrong places and disproportionately, but that can be ""solved"" with a better taxation and regulatory system.

If you let everyone run businesses freely and charge them 80% income tax you would get a healthier system than what you have now.  I'm not advocating for a 80% income tax, but it would be better than total and complete inflation and poverty.  At least people would keep working for the 20% they get to keep (and the 80% pays for the social programs).

The problem with the current system of centralizing control over all industries and businesses is that it eliminates all incentives to do anything useful.  If I can't even get 20% of my value out of the business then why bother running it well?  It turns out that those in charge did best by stealing what they could and letting it burn.
