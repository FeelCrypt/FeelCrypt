"It’s a bit like sports. Not everyone has time or money to master a game, but watching streamers or Let's Players only costs an internet connection, which most peoplw have anyways
 For some people, myself included, it's the personality of the streamer or Let's Players that's entertaining, not the game. This clip is completely obnoxious, in my opinion, and definetly not a good example of all streamers. 

I recommend Achievement Hunter for let's plays, there's about a dozen of them now so there's a lot of personality combinations for everyone. Try their GTA heist videos, they're hilarious, and their series  attempting to get the criminal masterminds achievement is nailbiting.

I can't really recommend a streamer since I don't usually have the time for live streams, but I do enjoy Something Witty's Soupcan Academy roleplay, they post the full stream on YouTube afterwards.

"I'm not a fan of streaming. I don't watch streamers or professional sports often. 

I'm playing devil's advocate. 

If you're against streaming video games you're also against professional, college, and amateur sports being broadcast. You're literally paying to watch someone better than you play. 

Many people watch to learn how to improve their own game. I've peeked on in a few streams before to improve my own gaming. But I don't think I even have a twitch account. 

Sorry dude.

"This is an extremely poor analogy to be honest. Most people have no access to getting into the NFL or ever playing football even.

Games are readily available for you to play. Of course not everyone is good at games, and there is some kind of similarity in certain contexts here, but completely different things for the most part.

I don't understand why so many people watch random streamers, but it is evident most of these people are kids aka millenials.";0;1;False;Khronikos;dusphyz;A popular streamer started accepting crypto in donations, this is how he thanks them;7zyl4t;https://clips.twitch.tv/TrappedEndearingGoatYee

Agree.;1;0;False;bpbenda;dut656r;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted. I will report EVERYTHING that occurs to this community.;7h87mc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7h87mc/im_likely_one_of_the_coinbase_14000_that_the_irs/
"IMO The IRS will not stop at the $20k transaction level. This is only the beginning. At some point Coinbase will cave in and provide  all user transactions to the IRS, just like any stock brokerage firm must do. 

It will either be forced upon them through government regulations or by pressuring them to make a deal, the pressure being the auditing of all Coinbase employees and directors.

So, if you were not part of the 14,000 +$20K users between 2013-2015, IMO you will still be audited at some point. Such an audit will be as simple as sending a warning letter to all Coinbase users who did not report their crypto transactions, telling them to amend those tax returns or simply pay the stated calculated taxes plus penalties. They will give you the option to pay over 3 years. Watch and see.

Better to be safe and amend past taxes now.

What will be the result? Coinbase will have no other choice than to become a transparent asset trading company, just like brokerage firms. Thus will drive out the users that want crypto to be totally anonymous and"" tax-free"" through tax fraud. The remaining users on Coinbase will be the ones who have accepted the fact that they must pay taxes. I wonder what percentage of users will still use the service.

The ones who want to avoid taxes will surely try to use the new Robin Hood anonymous exchange, but will have to do transactions via VPN tunnels, etc to avoid being caught.";2;1;False;justanotherminer;dusv151;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.
