"EDIT: Had to edit some slight math errors. Changed the post to reflect it. /Edit.

If bitcoin hits 100k, that means it'll be worth ~25x what it is now.

How many times has bitcoin been worth 25x what it was previously? Let's see...

[According to the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin#2011), in Mar 2010 a bitcoin was worth 3 thousandths of one cent. 25x .003 is .075, which is close to .08 (8 cents.) Incidentally, it hit $0.08 in July 2010. That's 1.

25x .075 is about $1.875, or about $2. In Dec 2011, bitcoin price is  reported as being $2. That's 2.

25x 2 is 50. I don't see an exact point where bitcoin is reported at $50 on the wiki, so I looked up a price graph, [here.](https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/) If that graph is accurate, on Mar 18, 2013 bitcoin's price hit $50. That's 3.

25x 50 is $1250. We almost got there in Jan 2014, but not quite. It capped just around $1000 before plummeting, and it didn't fully recover until Jan 2017. Apr 2017 it hit $1250 for the first time (as far as I can tell.) That's 4.

In 7 years, as of Jan 2017, bitcoin's value has multiplied by 390,625. That's no joke. 25 * 25 * 25 * 25, which is how the math works out here. And that's only getting to $1250. 

It's quite a bit more (over 3x more) if you consider the current value. That's right: bitcoin's value has more than tripled since January of *this year.* If you average the growth from 2010 when the first exchange opened, bitcoin's value has gone up 1,674.1% per year (accounting for tripling so far this year.)

You wanna prove people wrong, I dunno if hitting another 25x current value will do it.

"But that's exactly it.  What exactly are US regulations on crypto?  Why would the US even consider a ban?  They wouldn't do it to themselves, and until they can convince all other so-called countries that they would (which is silly and stupid as it is), why would you even argue that they would tell other countries' banks to do it, which is another entirely challenging and improbable thing in itself?  Certainly not to protect their banks, which are owned by non-Americans.  I mean I can toss my money into an open fire and both you and I can acknowledge that.  Do you think I would ever do that in my lifetime?  The discussion over that would be pointless.

And we should probably agree to disagree that the US can cripple crypto badly for everyone else in the world.  The US is but one country, and I'm sure you think very highly of the US.  On the contrary, I see a waning nation that will happily cater to the highest bidder.  You've seen China taken out of the equation the last few weeks.  Crypto can take the US out too.  I think you overestimate the US' influence too much.

In the inconceivably stupid scenario where the US decides to ban crypto for whatever ridiculous motivation, it can fire all the nukes it wants to.  Crypto will evolve and find a way, just like piracy.  The combination of the internet and blockchain technologies have given birth to this new paradigm that no centralized government or authority can effectively control.  It's an amazing, transformative technology that everyone will have to acknowledge, and accept.

edit:  if you meant that the US government would cripple crypto for Americans, then that qualification can be acceptable.  Sure, in the short term maybe.  Any government can oppress their citizens.  If you think they can do that worldwide, good luck with that.  Even the US doesn't get its way in the WTO.  You can check again how TPP failed.

"The value is in the market cap, the actual real dollars and other currencies placed into bitcoin and ourchased from the miners. The miners made their money already, less than 20% remain to be mined, yet the price is rising. You don't know what but I do: it's the fucking adoption rate!

It used to be a few guys, then a few thousand, then ten thousand, then a million, now several million, eventually a hundred million, all putting their real currencies into bitcoins and making transactions. 

This is the market cap naturally growing from the adoption rate. Meanwhile, scarcity means the value must go up from supply and demand. It's not value from the miners, yet miners had value in the beginning: each coin cost hardware, time, and electricity. The whole concept is proof of work, and costs. They weren't speculating, they were early adopters. You can still mine! You can skip all that and buy in before the other 99% of the adoption rate potential of the earth catches on. Eventually once the adoption rate settles, so will the rising value of the coin. Speculators using past trends and extrapolating expect bitcoins to exceed $100,000 each by like, 2030 or so, give or take whatever spikes in the adoption rate happen along the way. Maybe they're overestimating, but most of these estimates are actually very conservative. My calculations show about 60k per bitcoin by 2030. Others are saying it could become adopted to 50% penetration essentially overnight, much like social media and the smartphone and color tv had before it. It could hit $100,000 by the end of 2019 if more companies and countries and investment firms move their capital into bitcoin, moving trillions of dollars into the bitcoin market cap and raising the value a decade early on their own. 

In some cases, we will actually see the term ""overnight trillionaires"".

It sounds like a scam, but if 6 billion other people suddenly start wanting something and just you few millions of people have 3 or 4 each, I promise you will sell when buy bids on the exchange start showing 5 digits, then 6. That's what competition in the market will look like, same as rushes to any other trillion dollar industry will look like, like the one going on into space, on the level 5 autonomous roads, and the drone delivery, all emerging trillion dollar markets. People flock to buy in, to, and from these things, just like they did electricity and the modern roads. Bitcoin will blend into society.

"Just to speak to these 3 points:

Because you can quickly replenish what you use and avoid the exchange of sensitive personal information in the process .. while also potentially saving the merchants 2-3% on credit card fees which for low margin companies translates to a large percentage.

There's always a chance it goes to 0, but the resilience of this system after 8 years of constant attack technically and politically is certainly astounding.

The system is quite a beautifully designed concept that has functioned remarkably well ... the bitcoin blockchain's heartbeat is strong inspite of years of decent and FUD.  For mining to be economical over time as the block reward is reduced, the price must rise to provide a commensurate incentive to continue the operations of securing the network such that the collected fees and newly minted coins still make viable sense to keep the machines on.  If it no longer makes sense, then that miner drops off .. if enough do, the hash rate drops until the it reaches a level where others were hoping to jump in and turn their machines back on.  Eventually the fees will be able to cover the entirety of the network security which commands an obviously higher price ...

I don't understand the confidence people have in bitcoin. I don't think it's a scam but I think the only reason bitcoin has gotten this high is because the majority of people trading it have a fundamental misunderstanding of its intrinsic value. the price is unreflective of the actual value of the underlying asset and is instead propped up by a false demand being fueled by people that don't understand what they're doing buying gobs of cryptos.

Not an expert but my understanding is that adjusting the difficulty target is unrelated to allowing more coins to be mined.

"> Why would the US even consider a ban

They would probably consider a ban when crypto begins to impair the functioning of the state and if it starts to become a mainstream alternate currency.  Why would they try to enforce a international ban (related to banks) ? To kill crypto, because it would have no effect to only ban it in the US alone. 

I'm don't live in the US and I don't think highly of their institutions but I can see the effects of how long the the US' reach is over international banking regulations and on our (European) governments.

"Sure, but those qualifiers are pretty subjective after you take the governments out of the picture.  The only reason we even differentiate between commodity and currency is that commodities have time-values or are difficult to transport.

Using your example, it's like me being able to put that car in my pocket and able to go to any community and trade it for local currency or other goods/services.

No.

Trading volume is the only thing that matters for stability. If, in a day, only one coin was exchanged at ~4k, any old schmuck could create volatility by selling a coin the next day for 5k to his buddy.

Its only because trading volumes are ~0.7B$ that these sort of ""random asshole attacks"" are impossible.

Even if the market cap was 100x higher, if the trading volume was still just 4k, random assholes could swing it.

I'm sorry but you are simply failing to see the fundamental effect that market Cap/price will have on trading.  You cannot separate price from market cap on a currency with such a limited supply.  At a market cap of $69 Billion and price of $4150 BTC can get pushed around.  Eventually as the Price/Cap rises the amount of capitol needed to push it around also grows.  If BTC continues to grow eventually it will get to a point even that even the top 1% using leverage won't be able to swing the price very much.  Even if you believe this is a big bubble you really have to consider the effect of fiat capitol and very cheap money allowing the majority of these traders to capitalize in the first place.

And the price of your food is not a real reflection of demand and supply. It's a carefully controlled experience that governments make sure works to keep people from rioting.

So we will always have fiat based prices. We will use some sort of credit and debt system.

BUT the settlement layer, that will SURELY change.

"> But that's not new. That has always been a threat

First, rereading your original comment, I agree that my response doesn't meet your specification of ""something else that is novel that is likely to happen."" It's certainly not novel, as you say. The likelihood of happening is debatable, though, and that's what's important to people relying on Bitcoin.

I do understand network effects, but unlike, say, TCP/IP, a global cryptocurrency in widespread use - orders of magnitude larger than today - will have enormous political and competitive pressures on it. The events we've seen so far have had the benefit of playing out in a mostly enthusiast community, but things like the lack of traditional governance is likely to be a major sticking point for wider adoption.

If national governments create or adopt cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin - which seems likely to happen sooner or later - that could consign Bitcoin more permanently to a kind of niche status, with less interest in mainstream adoption than it has today.

Keep in mind that the total value of all Bitcoin today is about 0.3% of the market cap of the S&P 500. It hasn't even begun to enter the mainstream as a currency, and that's likely to change the game significantly.

As for your other example, Facebook, don't forget the examples of MySpace, or Digg, or Slashdot. Facebook could die completely, especially if there was a paradigm shift like the one from desktop apps to the web. 

In cryptocurrencies, a much less significant technical change could make Bitcoin obsolete, although of course it's always possible that some sort of chain replacement could occur, carrying the Bitcoin name and value into a new technical form.

> blockchain tech is creating new value

Absolutely, but it's the tech that's important. Bitcoin just happens to be the first mover, that did very well out of the gate.

> bitcoin is evolving towards filling the base-money role

But in many ways, that's where it faces some of the biggest challenges, both technical and political, some of which I touched on above.

>  the onus is definitely on skeptics and detractors to explain plausible scenarios to undo what bitcoin has already succeeded at. 

If by ""undo"" you mean something like putting the cryptocurrency genie back in the bottle, I agree with you. I was just talking about how Bitcoin might be replaced. I think that there's a reasonable chance that it could have a lifecycle that's relatively short. Anyone who's significantly economically involved with it might want to keep that in mind.

E.g. TCP/IP is 40+ years old, which is millennia in cryptocurrency years. There's enormous interest in blockchain tech at the moment, with all sorts of companies thinking about ways to make money from the tech, not specifically from Bitcoin. 

The developments over the next couple of decades are likely to make Bitcoin look a bit like the Model T Ford - another first mover that did fantastically well, ""the most influential car of the 20th century,"" but because of technological progress, its lifespan was 19 years.

> We have no cause nowadays to be defensive about it.

I agree. I'm trying to be realistic.

"Controlled substances are routed through a mechanism through which the government has some control (ports, roadblocks, raids etc.). Bitcoin is a mechanism over which the government has zero control. You can't ever possess bitcoin. It is a transaction in the blockchain. It's there after the entire worldwide internet goes boom. Which basically means the collapse of civilisation. If you have the keys you can access it.

The only thing that can be somewhat restricted is the sale of bitcoin. In the extremely unlikely event every government on the planet tries to ban it, buying and selling it would just need to function like controlled substances. Sure this hurts the price. Regulation does that. Maybe even long term kills Bitcoin. But it is not likely. Governments have tried this. Russia made Bitcoin illegal for example. It's legal again now that they realised they couldn't stop it. Plenty of governments would rather have a modicum of control and profit themselves than arbitrarily criminalize their citizens.

As investment in bitcoin grows, the prices of bitcoin should stabilize as it would take a larger amount of money to move the market. For example to move a market price up 10% with a marketcap of $10 million dollars would require someone with approximately $1 million dollars to buy into the market. To move a marketcap with $10 Billion dollars invested 10% would require someone to buy in with approximately $1 Billion dollars. As the bitcoin economy grows larger it will become harder and harder to move the market. Earlier investors who have seen their investments grow and have become tiresome of waiting will trade their bitcoins first for goods and services. As prices move slower and slower and as individuals become older, people will begin trading their bitcoins for goods and services.;1;1;False;Jushe;dnmq5xo;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

Based on your quote above, is it safe to assume that you think there is at least a 50% chance that Bitcoin is lower in 5 years than it is today? Do you think it is more like 50% chance, 60% chance, 70% chance, 80% chance, 90% chance? Is is that hard to make an educated guess? I have plenty of people in my network that trade traditional markets and they never have any problem making these types of general guesses, especially if they make a bold claim such as the one you made.

Yes, I have done pretty well in stocks. For example, I bought Nintendo stock back in 2015 for like $125 a share. The reason I did that, though, is because I knew Nintendo had assets it could leverage, products it would be producing, and a long history of profitability. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, though. You buy it speculating that the price will go up and hoping it will go mainstream, but there's no reason it should. It's kind of an interesting comparison. The Wii U never caught on mainstream because it's main gimmick (a second screen) wasn't something most people cared about. I am skeptical of bitcoin because I do not see the value of its main gimmick (decentralized currency). The currency we have already works, and I'm not convinced there are many people other than libertarians who really care about how money is regulated.

">Oooook but you miss the part where USD loses a few % per year from inflation

People have dollars to use as currency. In the time between getting paid and spending all the money they will not have lost any meaningful amount of value. Most people don't have savings they just have debt, so inflation actually helps since it reduces the value of your debt.

>I said to try and point out some flaws or issues you have with the tech

Poor scalability (re:confirmation times, transaction capacity), upcoming forks that threaten to fragment the userbase, mining is dangerously centralized (one group once had 45% out of the 51% needed to compromise the network) which allows them to have significant influence to effect the development of the currency in their favor, inbuilt deflation discourages use of bitcoins as an actual currency rather than a store of wealth, most people who are invested in bitcoins are simply holding them til they stop appreciating in value rather than spending them as currency, incentives for mining die off over time which will create incentive for miners to switch to other currencies as rewards dwindle";1;0;False;suninabox;dnna8e7;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

Once the lightning network, or whatever form allows quick, safe transactions, kicks in, it will work just fine.

"> It's not very liquid. I can't spend bitcoin at the supermarket, corner store, Amazon, etc.

There are two views on this - the Bitcoin maximalists and the Bitcoin minimalists. The maximalists believe bitcoin will replace fiat and be accepted everywhere. The minimalists view Bitcoin more akin to the infrastructure of the Internet where applications are built on top of it.

I lean towards the later minimalists view because I don't think a single currency can be applied to the entire global economy. We'll need many currencies but a single blockchain. Not just currencies but there is a lot that can be implemented on the blockchain - rewards programs, credit rating, property registrars.

There is a real problem being solved here - disintermediation of trusted parties. There are so many places where this is used in our world today that it isn't obvious immediately where it can be applied. Same way the web disintermediated middle men and it was difficult to envisage AirBnB and Uber back in the early 90s.

In either of these cases the core blockchain becomes a valuable network and valuable record space. The only failure case I see for blockchains is an alternative to Bitcoin, not all of them failing - it's too revolutionary a concept.

I buy the argument that Bitcoin has become too popular too quickly - before there is enough application, but it is very difficult to undo so many people being so fanatically obsessed with a technology. You're never never going to be able to convince everybody that Bitcoin is worth zero - and attempting to argue it has the opposite impact because of the blowback effect. Tens of millions of wallets, 100,000 nodes, 300k subs here, billions invested, the worlds largest super computer, etc. I don't even know where to begin to create scenarios and probabilities where this might go away - but I can create scenarios and assign probabilities to it growing.

> what is to stop governments from blocking its usage with laws? 

They can try to block the network but it won't work - it's too resilient. China has a ridiculously expensive nation-wide firewall powered by a lot of data and machine learning but all it takes to route around it is a single connecting node obfuscated in web traffic. They haven't succeeded in blocking Tor and Bitcoin should be more resilient since every client can relay traffic

They can attempt to block the interface between bitcoin and the financial system but there will always be jurisdictions that outcompete by allowing it. It's better to know what is happening on Bitcoin by applying regulation to it rather than driving it underground or offshore

I'm completely open to hearing why Bitcoin would fail, but it would have to include a replacement in the argument because you can't uninvent blockchains as they have far too much utility. It would also have to rationalize how hundreds of thousands of fanatics change their minds - today what is considered bad news for Bitcoin sees most of these people rallying to buy ""cheap"" coins and holding on. It's human nature to be stubborn like that.

No, I'm conflating it. That is to say that I don't think a currency is meaningful as an abstract concept outside of the economy it is within: they're inseparable.

"wrong. you're confusing [PONZI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) with [PYRAMID scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme).

Pyramid is not incorrect use of the term at all, and I agree with you that (what you're describing) a Ponzi scheme is incorrect in describing bitcoin, and many people have used it thusly.

Pyramid is a bit unfair, I'll admit, because there is no centralized ""tip of the pyramid"" but technically the people who started it are that, impossible for them not to be.

But would you agree that you recruit a friend to join bitcoin, and their desire to buy some increases valuation of it? That it is more valuable simply if 1,000,000 all want some of it versus 1,000? Just the nature of it makes it a pyramid scheme -- and I see nothing wrong with that, I still contend that all currency must be one.

"That doesn't offer any equalization or disadvantage to the rich vs. the poor though, so it's moot? ie, you get more of the new currency when you have more of the old currency: the advantage transfers along with the fiat.

I'm talking about going from 0 currency to ""now there is currency."" There is no way to do it democratically, perpetually. 

Say you invented PlooploopCoins right now and every person in existence is given 100 of them. What do you do with the people born tomorrow? OK, say you issue them to all newborns moving forward.

What do you do when more people die one year than another? Or when one family has more kids and another family can't have any? And so on... there is no fair way to do it to the point that any truly fair system would hinge on not actually having a currency and just itemizing expenditures with some sort of limit.

"1.  You can spend bitcoins everywhere you said you could not.  Do your research.  There are bitcoin debit cards, sites that allow you to purchase Amazon gift cards, and other P2P options. Overstock has hoarded their BTC from customer's purchases, not traded it for fiat.

2.  Citizens of countries with high inflation are currently and have been using BTC as a currency.  It is a decentralized Peer to Peer network, so it can circumvent the foolish state actors who attempt to ban it.  However, as of right now, most countries have not made it illegal in any way. 

3. The value is going up because of supply and demand. However, there are many more use cases that you just don't seem to recognize, whereas many other investors continue to invest because they/we do. I know it sounds crazy, but some of us don't even care what the price is.

"Yes, there is certainly evidence that it could potentially hit 100k. That would only be like a 40% increase in the growth rate over the past 2 years. It is hard to talk about the growth because it obviously started out as essentially worthless, but a 25 fold increase would not be abnormal considering past performance (which I'm aware doesn't predict future performance).

Bitcoin still isn't ready for widespread adoption though. It really needs to improve the user experience, and the network itself still has some challenges to face (2x fork, scaling, fees, etc). So predicting how likely a rise of that magnitude would be is impossible, and anyone telling you otherwise is likely full of shit.

In my opinion, to get why a lot of people are so excited about bitcoin you really need to be at least some what educated in economics, philosophy, and computer science. Most of the detractors I've heard are usually not knowledgeable in one of those fields (usually computer science), and their criticisms stem from their misunderstanding of that aspect of bitcoin.

So I think it is possible, but no one can tell you how likely, and don't trust the opinion of others, because a lot of them don't fully understand it.

I'm not saying that it'll hit $100K ever, but I'd be willing to take the bet that it's not fading to zero. In fact, it's far more likely to hit $100K than hit $0 in the next 2 years, though I find both scenarios pretty unlikely.

I think if you wait until about 2022 that $25K is very possible, because you have the next halving coming into play and more and more buy in from wealthy funds and individuals who'll help further grow the ecosystem.

Ponzi schemes have one person (or a small group of people) at the top who control ALL the wealth. This is quite the opposite of Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows each of it's users to be their own bank. Meaning, my wealth is 100% liquid all of the time. I can spend it where ever, whenever and however I see fit. Unlike a Ponzi scheme that creates wealth through lies, Bitcoin creates wealth through supply and demand (like gold) and is backed by a global decentralized network that, at it's core, cannot be tampered with by any government or individual person. People are fond of calling Bitcoin digital gold. The beauty is that if you consider all the benefits of crypto currencies vs precious metals, it's fairly straightforward to make the argument that there is much more utility in the Bitcoin network than there is in gold.;1;1;False;p2pcurrency;dnlnhpx;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"Another interesting bit:

The first 25x value was a mere 4 months after bitcoin began trading (Mar 2010 - Jul 2010.) The second (Jul 2010 - Dec 2011) was 1 year, 5 months (or 17 months.) The third (Dec 2011 - Mar 2013) was 1 year, 3 months (or 15 months.) The fourth (Mar 2013 - Jan 2017) was 3 years, 10 months (or 46 months.)

Looking at this we can see general patterns which may not actually indicate anything, but I find interesting nonetheless. The time between the 1st and second 25x events (17 months) was roughly 4x as long as the time between the original valuation and the 1st 25x event (4 months.)  The time between the 3rd and 4th 25x events (46 months) was roughly 3x as long as the time between the 2nd and 3rd 25x events (15 months.) 

Also interesting, is that the time between the 2nd and 3rd 25x event (15 months) is actually 2 months less than the time between the 1st and 2nd 25x event (17 months.) If we ignore that possible outlier, it looks like roughly somewhere between 3x to 4x as long each time we reach another 25x value marker. I'll be interested to see if this holds true (putting us somewhere around 138 and 196 months [3-4x 46 months] from Jan 2017 before it's 25x current value again.) Then again, there's another possibility.

The the 1st and 2nd event were 4x as long as the original price to 1st. The 3rd and 4th event were only 3x as long as the 2nd to 3rd. This is a (very low sample size) *decrease* in the percentage of time added to the next 25x multiple. If the time multiplier continues to decrement, we could see it only being 2x as long as the last 25x multiple, which would put it around 92 months from Jan 2017 (2x 46 months.)

These predictions are unlikely to hold up as bitcoin is still fairly volatile, but may get more reliable with more data (and, more data may be available if I look only at how long it takes to double in value, as that has happened way more often over the same time period than gaining a whopping 25x value.)";1;1;False;kaeroku;dnn04i0;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"Once upon a time, the world used gold as a currency. There is a limited amount of gold on the planet, and as more and more gold is dug up and minted into coins, less of it exists in the ground, so the rate that new gold is dug up slows down until eventually there's no more gold left in the ground and it's all in circulation. Let's say there 21 million tons of it in total, for arguments sake.

The people who mined gold earliest made more gold than the miners who started later. Does that make it a ponzi scheme? The gold is still valuable to people who have never mined gold, and those people are safe in the knowledge that the gold they own can't be magically devalued by other people conjuring more gold out of thin air, only by mining more of the limited gold from the ground.

Sure you want to define everything, where ""the early bird get's the worm"" applies, as a ponzi?

Ponzi schemes are usually designed to collapse at some point. Miners will still have a job to do, even if the last bitcoin has been mined.

Also, there are no promises of future returns. Enter at your own risk.

> the whole system is intended to reward those who started it

Not at all, it's more of an side-effect that those entering earlier stand to gain more than latecomers. Keep in mind though that early adopters also take on more risk.

"Wow, that is an extremely narrow view and misses the larger game of buyers and users and holders of the currency. But you are right in your analysis of miners. Miners produced the coins and early miners produced coins easier, BUT:

Look, if you aren't in bitcoin now, then when you get in and use it to spend, it's worth what you put in, no ups or down.
If you put cash in today, it's worth exactly what you put in. Spend it and you're done. Your transaction fee was smaller than paypal and the ATM. Isn't bitcoin fucking awesome! And no one knows you bought heroin and dildos and all the other stuff you can find on sites like Amazon around the net because it's a nameless transaction.
Meanwhile, there is an increasing yet fluctuating adoption rate in the background, where more and more retailers and users are preferring or accepting or trying and experimenting with bitcoin.
Every time someone adds more money of any global currency into the limited supply of bitcoin, they are buying it from someone else who originally mined it using hardware and electricity through an exchange at the current price. More users for the same amount of bitcoins means the value overall goes up. That is a basic principle of supply and demand on an item with scarcity.
This is where the dollar and the bitcoin diverge.
The dollar decreases in value every year, because it is printed out and not fixed to any commodity, so it has no scarcity. there is essentially limitless paper and ink in the world. On the other hand, there are only a handfull millions of bitcoins, and they are not region locked like a currency.
Meanwhile, teh bitcoin increases in value every year. So far, part of that is a bubble from speculation and a result of artificial supply bottlenecks and liquidity restrictions from hloders within the market....
BUT there is also the overall year to year growth from the increasing adoption rate, and this increasing adoption rate is where people from different countries buy some bitcoin from the supply and spend all or some or hold it, which overall leaves only an ever smaller portion of bitcoins available for newcomers buying from the pool of bitcoins with their new paper currency. Because there is scarcity caused by the stationary units of bitcoins and an increasing adoption rate, the overall trend over longer periods of time is always up, from the weight of new currency removing more and more bitcoins as will the waves after them.
Because the current adoption rate is a few million people, perhaps a single percent globally, you can safely conclude that if the bitcoin adoption rate became, say, 10% globally, say 700 million people, that you would expect a leftover bitcoin in your account from 2017 to be worth that same magnitude more by about 2020, give or take the fluctuations and bubble effects you see in the charts on the short term. Not a scam. Not a pyramid scheme. Supply and demand. Like gold backed dollars were, or gold itself. But no transaction fees above the spot price. No checking account fees. No 3% transaction fees. No international currency exchange fees. No taxes on purchases and sales unless agreed by both parties. Instant transfers (compared to ACH credits and the other traditional financial instruments)
If the 2017 price is fluctuating between $2200 and $4400, you can just about guarantee (speculation based on historical trends) that it reach between $20,000 and $50,000 at the same time it's adoption rate reaches that 10x benchmark from 1% adoption rate of today to 10% adoption rate.
Or 12%, where bitcoin is worth over $60k.
Or why not 20% adoption rate?
This is what hodlers know that you don't and this is why it's value goes up without being a scam. I hope you also purchase some ethereum because it's going to overcome bitcoin in the long term, and it's at a 8% the price of bitcoin right now. Your thousand bucks today could be worth a house in the next 5 years. It would have been worth 1000 houses if you spent that 1000$ 10 years ago. This is what the adoption rate curve looks like. Feel free to go to your favorite exchange and look at the chart sorted by all time.
I'll wait. You can't miss what an exponential growth curve looks like. You haven't seen anything yet. They say ""to the moon"" all the time because when we're all trillionaires our only problem will be deciding which color space-lambos to drive on the moon.
It's funny this still has to be explained after ten years, but here we are, and I don't really mind making a few billion/trillionaires in my wake. You're welcome new guys, and welcome to the show. Don't forget me, this is no bullshit! I just made the bet a winning bet. Don't go into 2018 without a bitcoin in your pocket! You were warned!
My bitcoin address is: 1AKk2CpktpvmRgZtqxB85CMRL6V99FhyTd
But honestly I prefer ethereum right now, with much larger short term growth potentials for the same reasons as above, so if you appreciate this wisdom in a week then send those ETH over here: 0x606b929feca92441754b8ea9e8cd87bb8ece4d2d

In the last year, bitcoin quadrupled from $1,000 to $4,000. The number of people using bitcoin has not quadrupled, the amount of goods being bought and sold has not quadrupled, the number of merchants accepting bitcoin has not quadrupled. That value is coming almost entirely from people buying bitcoins to speculate on them, not spend them as currency.

Less than 4% of the total volume of bitcoins are being traded in any given year. That is not the sign of a thriving currency, its the sign of an asset that's being hoarded and speculated on. The velocity of bitcoin is terrible, and it has been hardwired into the currency by guaranteeing it will deflate over time.

No one wants to spend a currency that will be worth considerably more next month than it is this month. For any vendor that accepts both dollars and bitcoin, why would you buy in bitcoin and not dollars when dollars will be worth less over time and bitcoins will be worth more?

Stability and price are not intrinsically linked. The incentives and attractiveness of speculation are what keep bitcoin volatile.

Do you allow for any difference between speculation and investing or saving in your bubble assumption?  You can trade all day everyday and constantly manipulate the daily value.

"The implication was that we are anxious to sell. That is observably not the case. Most say that they will sell some in the future at a higher price, but not necessarily for fiat, instead in exchange for goods and services. And they will not dump at some arbitrary price, but sell over time.

Further, the implication was that Bitcoin has no value and its only value is in handing it off at a higher price. This is also not the case. Bitcoin is a peer to peer digital cash system. A given amount of btc has value because it is a unit embedded within a system that is in many ways a superior money system. Not in all ways, but in some, and that's enough for people to speculate that they value these units. Money is not useful in and of itself. It's the context that gives money value, the amount that you trust one money network over another. Fiat has value because you trust the network maintained by state x or y. Precious metals have value because they have some uses outside of money, they are durable, fungible, and have a long history. Thus the network of precious metal markets gives gold, silver, etc, value beyond their non-money uses. They are also money units and are valued additionally in that regard.

People trust the Bitcoin network because of various reasons and therefore the units of money have value because they are embedded in that network. Just like worthless dollar bills have value because they are embedded in the USG network.

The core problem is that many see money atomically, each unit having intrinsic value. In fact, money is a network and the units are stand ins for debts owed within the network.";1;1;False;;dnlwefx;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"I am not a hardcore bitcoin zealot, but *this* statement

> Bitcoin is the first asset on the internet that cannot be copy and pasted

**cannot be overstressed.**

Bitcoin proved that digital assets can have artificial scarcity applied. This brings market economics into the Internet era as a purely-digital affair.

Previously assets had to exist somehow. They could have digital representations (electronic receipts, ledger balances, etc), but since those representations could be copied the representations *themselves* could not be assets.

Now digital assets can be assets *on their own*.

That is HUGE.

This is bits-vs-atoms at the scale of Goldman Sachs.

"Holy shit, so much this.

I'm starting to feel like crypto investors (mostly people that got into cryptos due to mining in the last 12 months) are so much into prices and returns that they are absolutely the worst people to listen about cryptos.

Lousy, ignorant (meaning some of them don't even understand exactly what a blockchain is, I'm serious), annoying.

Reading bitcointalk today's pure shit. Everywhere you go it's all ""money, money, money"" and ""omg this coin's so good, buy before too late, this is going to moon"".

Yes I invested in cryptos as well, I trade everyday, but holy fuckin hell, no I'm not sure we're going to replace money with a blockchain, and even less I believe in a world where governments and banks do not avoid tracking our money.

I see the fascination, I do believe some coin's might spread their use around the internet, I do believe that the blockchain technology will have a huge spread with the IoT but at the end of the day, even as an investor, what I care of is to see a world's that more just (which is what the original idea was).

I do know two people (one of them's a moderator on bitcointalk) that I know they mined **thousands** of bitcoins in 2009-2010 when everybody was mocking them for chasing monopoly money.

They were here mining thousands of litecoins later, ethereum, investing and buying.

They are among the richest people on this planet, they ain't billionaires but they have more than enough money to retire on a private island with the Brazzers cuties shoving their cocks in the back of their throats 24/7.

But in fact what they do, what they really care about is actually spreading the utility behind blockchain technologies. They ain't those scamming you (and trust me, they could given their high reputation in the bitcoin community), they ain't those tracking bitcoin's price 24 7, no they are those who truly believe in the social justice that cryptocurrencies could bring.

They are anarchists to their bones, and they really care about stuff like freedom and not being controlled by the governments.

You described it perfectly when you say it stink of used cars salesmen.

"Look, if you aren't in bitcoin now, then when you get in and use it to spend, it's worth what you put in, no ups or down. 

If you put cash in today, it's worth exactly what you put in. Spend it and you're done. Your transaction fee was smaller than paypal and the ATM. Isn't bitcoin fucking awesome! And no one knows you bought heroin and dildos and all the other stuff you can find on sites like Amazon around the net because it's a nameless transaction. 

Meanwhile, there is an increasing yet fluctuating adoption rate in the background, where more and more retailers and users are preferring or accepting or trying and experimenting with bitcoin.

Every time someone adds more money of any global currency into the limited supply of bitcoin, they are buying it from someone else who originally mined it using hardware and electricity through an exchange at the current price. More users for the same amount of bitcoins means the value overall goes up. That is a basic principle of supply and demand on an item with scarcity. 

This is where the dollar and the bitcoin diverge. 

The dollar decreases in value every year, because it is printed out and not fixed to any commodity, so it has no scarcity. there is essentially limitless paper and ink in the world. On the other hand, there are only a handfull millions of bitcoins, and they are not region locked like a currency. 

Meanwhile, teh bitcoin increases in value every year. So far, part of that is a bubble from speculation and a result of artificial supply bottlenecks and liquidity restrictions from hloders within the market.... 

BUT there is also the overall year to year growth from the increasing adoption rate, and this increasing adoption rate is where people from different countries buy some bitcoin from the supply and spend all or some or hold it, which overall leaves only an ever smaller portion of bitcoins available for newcomers buying from the pool of bitcoins with their new paper currency. Because there is scarcity caused by the stationary units of bitcoins and an increasing adoption rate, the overall trend over longer periods of time is always up, from the weight of new currency removing more and more bitcoins as will the waves after them. 

Because the current adoption rate is a few million people, perhaps a single percent globally, you can safely conclude that if the bitcoin adoption rate became, say, 10% globally, say 700 million people, that you would expect a leftover bitcoin in your account from 2017 to be worth that same magnitude more by about 2020, give or take the fluctuations and bubble effects you see in the charts on the short term. Not a scam. Not a pyramid scheme. Supply and demand. Like gold backed dollars were, or gold itself. But no transaction fees above the spot price. No checking account fees. No 3% transaction fees. No international currency exchange fees. No taxes on purchases and sales unless agreed by both parties. Instant transfers (compared to ACH credits and the other traditional financial instruments)

If the 2017 price is fluctuating between $2200 and $4400, you can just about guarantee (speculation based on historical trends) that it reach between $20,000 and $50,000 at the same time it's adoption rate reaches that 10x benchmark from 1% adoption rate of today to 10% adoption rate.

Or 12%, where bitcoin is worth over $60k. 

Or why not 20% adoption rate?

This is what hodlers know that you don't and this is why it's value goes up without being a scam. I hope you also purchase some ethereum because it's going to overcome bitcoin in the long term, and it's at a 8% the price of bitcoin right now. Your thousand bucks today could be worth a house in the next 5 years. It would have been worth 1000 houses if you spent that 1000$ 10 years ago. This is what the adoption rate curve looks like. Feel free to go to your favorite exchange and look at the chart sorted by all time. 

I'll wait. You can't miss what an exponential growth curve looks like. You haven't seen anything yet. They say ""to the moon"" all the time because when we're all trillionaires our only problem will be deciding which color space-lambos to drive on the moon. 

It's funny this still has to be explained after ten years, but here we are, and I don't really mind making a few billion/trillionaires in my wake. You're welcome new guys, and welcome to the show. Don't forget me, this is no bullshit! I just made the bet a winning bet. Don't go into 2018 without a bitcoin in your pocket! You were warned! 

My bitcoin address is: 1AKk2CpktpvmRgZtqxB85CMRL6V99FhyTd

But honestly I prefer ethereum right now, with much larger short term growth potentials for the same reasons as above, so if you appreciate this wisdom in a week then send those ETH over here: 0x606b929feca92441754b8ea9e8cd87bb8ece4d2d

">I disagree. See here and here.

The first link is blocked as malicious and the second link just asserts that metcalfes law is the reason for the increase in value even without any explanation for how, or why previous doublings of the userbase hasn't quadrupled the value before.

If every doubling of the userbase quadrupled the value of bitcoin then bitcoin would be worth considerably more than it is now. So it fails the actual test of even explaining what has already happened let alone predicting what has happened.

This is very lazy pseudo-economics that just assumes ""network value"" somehow maps 1 to 1 with monetary value just because they both have the word value in the term. It's just trying to correlate random pieces of data with the price without any underlying economic theory. It also relies on the assumption that something that can be bought and sold as a commodity acts exactly the same as a telecoms network without variation. There are hundreds of other factors at play other than the size of the network. A cell phone doesn't cost 4x what it used to just because the ""network value"" has doubled when the number of people using cell phones doubled.

How does metcalfes law have any bearing on demand for bitcoins? Are transactions quicker now? Are they cheaper? No. Due to bitcoins poor scaling and systems of incentive, greater network size reduces utility of the currency, especially when most people are buying just to hodl. However bitcoin is designed to decrease in supply which is what is responsible for the speculative bubble.

>I don't see any problem with this.

It means it will stop being a currency like gold stopped being a currency once people started accepting fiat currency. As soon as governments could start paying for things with paper instead of gold no country wanted to spend its gold reserves when they could just spend paper instead since gold reserves appreciate whereas paper depreciates.

"If you use a bank it’ll be hard to understand. Ask people who are unbanked.

People get paid in bitcoin already, you can work and almost live on the blockchain. You will be able to in the next 10 years. 

Important distinguishing word there is “the blockchain”. It seems that if you want to make money on cryptocurrencies look into ICOs. More money was spent on ICOs than in all of venture capital this year (or so I read). You may not use bitcoin in daily life yet but you will use some other blockchain technology. Ben Bernanke is backing Ripple. Developers love Ethereum. There’s a blockchain startup designed at decentralizing what Dropbox does. And some have said that bitcoin may be the gold of the blockchain market. 

Regardless, my point is, a lot of the speculation in bitcoin is directly parallel to the speculation in the blockchain as a whole.

">I was thinking of a country experiencing​ hyperinflation, like in recent years, Brazil or Zimbabwe.

Why wouldn't they just use other more stable currencies that have more widespread usage? 

Which is what they do. Zimbabwe just use US dollars now.

US dollars are far more stable than bitcoin and accepted by far more merchants and have high velocity of money which makes them superior to bitcoin as a currency in almost every way. Not to mention its far more practical for an illiterate subsistence farmer in zimbabwe to just trade pieces of paper and metal than to try and set up a bitcoin wallet.

Bitcoin was designed not to be stable, it was designed to deflate, and deflationary currencies can't work in a system that also has inflationary currency because people will just spend the inflationary currency and hoard the deflationary one.

Gold for all intents and purposes has ceased being a functional currency because why buy something in gold (which will be worth more next year) when you can buy something in dollars (which will be worth less next year). However unlike gold, there is no hard limit on cryptocurrencies. It's practically impossible for gold to become worth nothing because it has unique industrial uses, is irreplaceable and practically impossible to make from scratch without ridiculous amounts of energy and resources.

You can make an identical copy of bitcoin for almost nothing. It's only value outside of speculation on artificial scarcity is how useful it is as a currency, and its value as a speculative asset directly opposes its value as a functional currency.  It's coasting mainly on being first to market. There is nothing to stop a more stable cryptocurrency from replacing it as a means of exchange.

"I started using Bitcoin around three years ago. I really liked it once I just quit trying to learn everything by reading and went ahead and made a wallet. I'm not an investor or anything, I work online and at the time my employers were pushing btc because of the insanely low fees. 




I have listened to different theories about how btc will dominate and be the main international currency and other ideas or a similar nature.



I always thought it would be very hard for it to become mainstream for the simple fact that occasionally a TX would take 25 or 30 minutes to confirm and I couldn't ever see that being practical as a replacement for credit cards or cash as I'd hear so many talking about.



I continued using Bitcoin almost daily up until the chain started bogging down and fees skyrocketed. Then it got better for a short time and then the price started growing and then the fees got so insanely high there was just no point in me using Bitcoin any longer unless I was doing something that required Bitcoin.




Don't get me wrong, I like Bitcoin, I think it's cool, and I still take a little of my pay in Bitcoin for my gambling needs and other bad habits. But I only ever take exactly what I need now as opposed to a couple years ago I'd go ahead and take all of my pay in BTC most of the time.



This is just a point of view from someone who is not an investor of any kind. Like I said, I loved it when it worked fast and had low fees but after this last few months with the crazy high fees like we all had to deal with Bitcoin is not something I have a desire to use anymore unless I need it.



After everyone saw the effect a jump in the value had on the functionality of Bitcoin i just don't see how anyone could still think BTC is going to become mainstream and used by everyone daily.

"Perhaps it is revisionist history for most. My mother even claims she knew it was a bubble because her house went up in value 5x in 10 years. She straight up sold and was begging her brother to sell. Did she know it was a bubble? Hell no. It was just a really good deal. However now she claims she always knew. So your point is valid.

Yet still, I worked at AIG from 2006 to 2015 in their analytics department and we *knew* there was a bubble in the housing market. It was widely reported in academic studies and severely lambasted in media - very similar to climate change and student loan debt in fact. What none of us knew was the severity. And while yes, The Big Short is a great overall summary by Lewis, it doesn't diminish that fact that the combination of mortgage fraud, deregulation, and complex securities had in the severity of the housing collapse. And that complexity was, you're right, widely u known. 

Just like we all know now there's a bubble in the post secondary financial market. But the severity, well shit, I don't want to think about how bad it might be. 

Edit: also without the cdo bundled pension funds in the UK and the entire economy of Iceland invested in falsely rated securities wouldn't have collapsed. To say the shitty mortgage backed securities wouldn't have necessarily changed the global impact if the didn't exist is just false. If that's what you're saying.

"My take is that the increase and new ATHs this year has got btc a lot of attention. Everyone keeps pointing to google trends and coinbase sign-ups as a good reason as to why the price should continue to grow but I see no fundamental differences or real use cases since SW and the halving (and a lot of that was likely priced in at around 400). I see so many new people and a exponential price increase as quite detrimental to the price because based on what I've noticed in /r/bitcoinmarkets there is a lot of new people who are expecting bitcoin to do nothing except go up. I'm not sure how many people will be able to stomach the volatility if it's not going in their favor but we will see. Even Tone Vays is quite fundamentally bearish at this price even though technically bitcoin looks like it could just carry on going higher.

I think a lot of people either are taking the view of never selling/spending their btc(which isn't really good for adoption) and a lot of people think BTC is on the verge of a global takeover(which I think is a bit OTT). People are jumping in expecting insane gains which is a bad sign to me since we've gone up like 25x from the lows and up 7x on the year.

Noone is behind the strings stealing money from a system which needs your participation to float. 

However, **Bitcoin is inherently a commodity currency.**

Anyone interested in economic history generally stumbles across a simple reality: It is beneficial to a community to move away from a commodity currency. 

The benefits of Bitcoin to an individual are inticing. But to a nation they are few and far between. 

And the most important rule of currency comes in to play. 

**Short of an economic crisis, peopple hold value in whatever currency they pay their taxes in.**

Even if Bitcoin starts to see widespread use its not going to replace the currency of a stable economy.

"You're approaching it from a point of view that bitcoin's ideal end-state is to replace traditional currencies.  I don't believe that is a realistic expectation either.  No government will readily give up their own control over their primary currency.

Bitcoin does have it's uses.  It's a great way to store value in failing governments and failing economies.  Additionally it's the most efficient way to transfer money overseas almost instantly for minimal fees.  It also takes money out of the hands of banks.  In America, that's not really a big deal as we like the security our banks provide.  But in other countries where access to banks is limited or not worthwhile, storing money in bitcoin is a good way to go.

"I understand your arguments, but can't one separate the blockchain technology from the coin? The technology itself is great, but the coin?

You don't have to block the exchanges to block the adoption of the coin. You can do stuff like make it illegal for banks to offer wallets to people. You can make it illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin as legal tender. Will people still try to do it? Sure, but you are not going to see Amazon breaking the law, or any other company. 

Look, I am willing to accept that I could be totally wrong. you are right, there are so many variables, and who can predict the future? but, with the wild fluctuation of the value of Bitcoin, I am not feeling the risk. Maybe if it gained a steady 2 - 5% of value per year. 

I'm very interested in seeing where this all goes.

"I looked at a couple of these bitcoin debit cards (which I had no idea existed). This is pretty cool, but it still just converts your bitcoin into local currency when you use it. If I spend 0.01 bitcoins at a store, they don't actually get 0.01 bitcoins, they get the local currency. So we have people running these cards, and every time someone uses it, the bank (is it s bank?) buys the bitcoin back from the user, increasing their horde of bitcoins. It's not actually transferred to anyone. So how does the the bank use it? They have to transfer it back to a real currency. How do they not go broke? They have to continually pump the value of the bitcoin up. 

Are people really using bitcoin as a currency (giving bitcoin and accepting bitcoin), not just using bitcoin to convert to local currency? I'd be far less skeptical if I could go to the corner store and give someone actual bitcoin, not just currency exchange it on the spot. Then I know there is a real economy based on it. As it stands right now, it is just a commodity.

"You're correct, thank you for pointing this out. I've updated my original comment to reflect this. 

Still, I do not believe pyramid scheme is an accurate description of crypto currencies. If so then the stock market would also be  pyramid scheme... Are the original investors of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, the ""tip of the pyramid""?

Per Wikipedia:

> A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

Comparing this to your scenario of recruiting a friend. I would have to apply additional instructions to that friend ""and when you go get another person involved, you'll get paid"". No one is (or at least shouldn't be) claiming that. 

And for that matter, if I recruit a friend to purchase Bitcoin, that doesn't necessarily increase the value of my current Bitcoin holdings. It is entirely possible that my friend goes onto an exchange, places a limit buy order for under spot price, and thereby does not increase the current valuation of bitcoin. Sure, he/she may contribute to increasing the overall *buying pressure*, which, *may* result in an increase in spot price. But that is not guaranteed (and anyone stating so, is lying). Any existing holder of Bitcoin could come along, and sell their current holdings at the price buyers are bidding at, thereby reducing the current spot price. 

In the scenario above, I would have then successfully recruited a friend into the Bitcoin economy, but because my friend was patient and waited for a seller to meet him at his desired price, my own Bitcoin is now actually worth less despite having added another player into the mix. 

I think it all comes down to a common question I see around here... ""What is Bitcoin?"" Is it 

* A store of value?
* A currency, to be used for commerce when trading value for a commodity?
* Is it a speculative investment tool, to be used for (the hope of) yielding higher profits in the future?

Which in my opinion, it is perfectly valid to say it is all of the above. However, due to this digital form of currency being very much in it's infancy (sure 2013 and 2017 were both dramatic years of increased interest, but in the grand scheme of things 7-8 years is nothing) it can be very difficult for some people to accept the first two concepts above. 

**A Store of Value** Gold has been around, and people have put value on it, for thousands of years. Also due to it's (somewhat) finite supply it is rather resistant to decreasing in value due to increased supply. Who knows though, maybe when space exploration advances we'll find some huge supply of gold from an asteroid. Back to Bitcoin, due to it's finite supply, and, (like gold) people are willing to place value on it, it can currently be used as a store of value. Will it stand the test of time though? We have yet to see. 

**A Currency** This is still up for debate, however I am on the side that it is. Adoption of it on a global scale however, is once again, in the very early stages. I'd be very hard pressed to walk around and find a single store in my area that accepts bitcoin, despite living in a metropolitan area. Additionally, Bitcoin will never completely replace Fiat. I sure hope it gains significant adoption globally that I can use it in my every day life, but it will not replace fiat due to it's dependency on the internet. I was thinking about this actually just this afternoon while listening to MPR about the current state of Puerto Rico. I believe over 80% of their power grid is out at the moment... Good luck using bitcoin there even if your local shop accepts it.

**As a speculative investment tool** In it's current state, it is obvious that it is being used for this. Myself being one of them. Many people are betting on it raising in value. Some are simply holding for the day it becomes a certain amount, others are day trading on it. Much to your point though that the more people who join in the space, the less likely the later joiners will benefit (as much) in ongoing gains. Come that day though, the stabilization of the price will drastically improve the purposes of it being ""A store of value"" and a ""currency, to be used in trade, for a commodity"". And those late adopters while may not see gains they can make use of those aspects much more easily.";1;0;False;Kobens;dnlrypu;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"I don't know.  What if all users got a small fixed rate, and early adopters mined, but most of the money went into an escrow account, to pay out other users later?  It would encourage and accelerate adoption equally, but by promising new users payouts when the mining is getting harder, rather than giving big payouts to the already passionate initial users, who'd likely stick around for other reasons (like believing in and developing for the platform) anyway.

There must be a way, if only through digital contracts built on a blockchain, rather than directly creating something like bitcoin.";1;0;False;;dnm9elh;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

The most real fact about internet is that no matter how strong the governments are (or my become) will never be able to limit the existence of an inner society there able to create something that will never be controlled by those censor whales. Bitcoin was the first official money for that society, now followed by dozen of other cryptos, so this has no limit & will never be controlled.
