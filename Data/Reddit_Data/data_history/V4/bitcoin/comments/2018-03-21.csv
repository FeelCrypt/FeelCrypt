"You are living in a totally different reality than I am, it would seem.  In my reality, it's the BTC supporters that jump on literally every bit of positive news about BCH to crow ""BCASH BTRASH BCRASH Roger Ver Faketoshi Jihad Wu"".  In my reality, it's BTC supporters who attacked and slandered every dev who pushed for bigger blocks, to the point where a few of them (who were key figures in the early days of Bitcoin) left the community entirely.  In my reality, small blockers DDoS'ed XT nodes, fought tooth and nail against Bitcoin Unlimited and Classic and even a basic compromised increase to 2mb blocks.  In my reality, it's BTC supporters who constantly resort to insults, trolling, censorship, and blocking to drown out or silence anyone who disagrees with them.  In my reality, it was BTC supporters who, when fees got high, tried to rewrite history and claim that Bitcoin was always meant to be digital gold/""a store of value"", and not p2p electronic cash to serve as a means of exchange for fast, cheap, uncensorable and permissionless payments.

Also in my reality, it's BCH supporters who are bringing back merchants that gave up on Bitcoin when the fees were outrageous last year.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who have developed a means of using SMS to send and receive Bitcoin (Cash), without smartphones or even internet, so that people in poor parts of the world can be their own banks.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who are working to fix and re-enable features in Bitcoin to restore its original potential.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who are sticking to simple, safe, PROVEN approaches to scaling in the short term instead of pushing unproven half-finished ""unicorn"" solutions that risk user funds.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who bring evidence, reasoning, and good faith to discussions about scaling issues, even though they are repeatedly trolled and shouted down for not falling in line behind Core.  In my reality, most of the people who were the fiercest and most prominent proponents of Bitcoin in its early days (when it was uncool, unsafe, and worth very little) have moved to supporting BCH.

When a project forks, be it soft, hard, or both, the whole idea of ""the original"" goes out the window.  There is no longer an ""original"" Bitcoin; there's Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Segwit (soon to be Bitcoin Lightning, as far as I can tell).  Both are Bitcoin. It's not hijacking or deceit to treat Bitcoin Cash like Bitcoin.  Our point of view is just as valid as yours, and there is no authority who can say differently.  And for the record, we DO ""educate the public"", that is the majority of what @Bitcoin does on twitter--it explains the difference between BTC and BCH and extolls the benefits of BCH while pointing out issues with BTC that the BTC community blithely ignores.

Right now it's ONLY the Bitcoin Cash community that acknowledges both sides of the split as valid; visit bitcoin.com and you'll find information on both coins, focused on their shared history. On any site run by a BTC proponent, you won't find Bitcoin Cash mentioned AT ALL, unless it's as ""BCash"", and it's referred to as a scam.  The Bitcoin Cash community doesn't make it personal; we don't look for dirty laundry in Adam Back's personal history, or Greg Maxwell's, or Peter Todd's, or Nick Szabo's.  Hell, most of us even applaud Elizabeth Stark and her team for their work on Lightning Network!  So I'm not sure what kind of warped reality you live in where BCH supporters look like the bad guys, but it has no connection to the world I live in.";2;1;False;;dw0y3l0;Today, I will defend Bitcoin in front of the Finance committee at the Canadian parliament (live);85j822;https://twitter.com/jhamel/status/975712250962087936

"Just a quick look through the two reddits and it's quite blatant the BCH supporters like to attack BTC. 

I've said that both sides have relevant points in the scaling debate. 

As for the sending of payments via SMS. That is something I will look into and is definitely a very cool bonus!

As for lightning being a unicorn. It isn't. It works, it has been proven to work. It did require a leap of faith though. I will give you that.

It is a shame the rift that has been caused by the politics of the scaling debate and there is definitely actors on both sides that are culpable. But me personally, I see a lot of discussion on technology from Core and a look a shit talking from Cash. In fact, just look at Ver's twitter and it just straight up attacks Core.

I do think that in the long run, we will see which direction the market will go. People have freedom of choice with these things. I will be telling people about 2nd layer solutions and sidechains. And you will be telling them about 0conf TXs. Both are valid ways to scale. Both have pros and cons. 

Anyway, let's agree to disagree and hope that all of this back and forth doesn't lead to Ethereum just obliterating both of us.

"bitcoin accomplishes two things at once: the security of the blockchain with securely transferring financial value.

both work together elegantly and (keyword) securely. Yes there are thousands of other alt-coins, each with their own special feature. but none have 10 years worth of battle-hardened security built into its blockchain and protocol. that's what makes it stand out: security.

a new coin coming out today may have some fancy new bells and whistles. that's all fine and good. but how's its network? its developers? how many bugs has it fixed? how many attacks has it defended against? it takes time to build a secure system against all of those things and still execute that fancy new feature in a way that is secure.

bitcoin is the first to do that; secure transactions thru a secure blockchain that has 10 years worth of data as proof that it weathered the storm and is stronger than ever. would you place $10000 on a new coin's blockchain that is perhaps 1 week or 1 month old? or would you place it on a blockchain that has 10 years worth of built-in security?";1;1;False;Ttatt1984;dw204pz;"""Bitcoin will be the single global currency of the internet,"" says founder of Twitter & Square";8617n5;https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/976315822397444098

"**Minitel**

The Minitel was a Videotex online service accessible through telephone lines, and is considered one of the world's most successful pre-World Wide Web online services.

The service was rolled out experimentally in 1978 in Brittany and throughout France in 1982 by the PTT (Postes, Télégraphes et Téléphones; divided since 1991 between France Télécom and La Poste). From its early days, users could make online purchases, make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, have a mail box, and chat in a similar way to what is now made possible by the Internet.

In February 2009, France Telecom indicated the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections.

"You're right, that doesn't mean that it won't be replaced, but why would it (be replaced)?

The only appeal it has is that it is the truly neutral currency of the future that can't be manipulated or supplanted by even the biggest players' efforts. If the community has enough foresight to know the most likely ways that might not become true and avoid them, why on earth would one of the plethora of premined money grabs supplant it? The elephant in the room is that there is no way to hide the obvious profit motive behind each and every one of them. They're tainted. They're not neutral. Whereas the original Bitcoin community were simply trying to build a 21st century currency. There was no profit motive back in 2009. It was just monopoly money and a dream. Every single altcoin can be traced back to a developer who cloned the Bitcoin code base, rebranded it, tweaked it, premined it, and ICO'd. Where are Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney now?

There's no way to hide the greed of altcoins, and it's yet another reason why Bitcoin is really, truly a great invention.

"When you buy something over the Internet with USD, you're most likely paying with a credit or debit card.  In any case, the use of credit or debit cards is most definitely not free.  

The credit card processing companies charge fees, generally between 1% and 4% of the transaction amount, to the merchant.  Most credit card processors forbid the merchant from passing those fees to the customer so the prices for products and services appears to be the same for cash or credit payment methods.  However, the credit card processing fees get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for every product to everyone.

Bitcoin, in it's current form, is not anywhere near a finished product.  The best comparison is that it's a pre-AOL and pre-WWW internet experience.  When the applications, like Lightning Network, are fully developed and widely adopted, spending bitcoins on the internet will be an amazingly simple process.

"**Bitcoin will become the world’s single currency, tech chief says**

Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade, Jack Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley’s leading entrepreneurs, has said.

Despite recent weakness in the value of bitcoin and concerns that it cannot currently process transactions fast or cheaply enough to act as a currency, Mr Dorsey, who is chief executive of both Twitter and the payments company Square, believes that bitcoin will overcome these obstacles and will be used to buy everyday items such as coffee.

Bitcoin is the world’s most popular digital currency and the best-known application of blockchain technology. It exists only as strings of computer code in an immutable, distributed digital public ledger. Created nine years ago, it came to prominence last year as its value rocketed to $20,000, turning some of its early adopters into billionaires in months. Its popularity led to an explosion of rival cryptocurrencies.

In November, Square said it would enable users in America to buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app. Bitcoin’s value has dropped sharply since then amid fears of a regulatory clampdown and warnings of a bubble. Yesterday it was trading at $8,803.

Mr Dorsey insisted that virtual currencies built using distributed ledgers would be the next big breakthrough decentralising technology. “The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” he told The Times. This would happen “probably over ten years, but it could go faster”.

As bitcoin became more widely used, it was up to payment processing companies such as Square to make sure it was widely accepted, he added.

Mr Dorsey is a bitcoin investor himself and this week was revealed as a funder of a start-up called Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. His comments highlight a debate among bitcoin enthusiasts about how best to transform it from a store of value into a means of quick and easy payments. Mr Dorsey accepted that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency”.

“It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,” he said.

The entrepreneur is in London this week to promote Square and declined to answer questions about Twitter. He co-founded Square as a mobile payments company in the US in 2009 and brought it to the UK last year. It is known for its small white credit and debit card readers that plug into smartphones and tablets. It offers next-day settlements to merchants in competition with the legacy card payment firms such as WorldPay and Barclaycard and rival start-ups such as iZettle.

Square is launching an instant deposit service. Merchants can use it to get funds into their bank accounts about 20 minutes after a transaction.

Mr Dorsey said that cashflow was a huge issue for small businesses and the ability to get paid instantly was crucial in enabling many of them to restock.

Although technically true you also need to remember that more saving=more future consumption. Right now saving at a bank is a little hard for the everyday person, savings and mutual fund returns  typically suck and don't even beat inflation. Now we have Bitcoin, which is deflationary and an easy store of value for the average Joe/Jane and keeping funds locked up is also very good for the price as it contributes to Bitcoins current scarcity.

"It really depends on how any individual uses credit cards, which are largely a First World luxury anyway.  The responsible way to use credit cards is to charge purchases to your account and then pay it off at the end of the month; however, I'm well aware that a large portion of credit card account holders use them to finance large purchases.  This behavior is the driving force behind the greatest redistribution of wealth in history, as consumers pay outrageous interest rates for purchases.  (As my grandfather used to say, ""Don't spend money you don't have on stuff you don't need to impress people you don't know."")   /endrant

In any case, I understand your question to be more about how to build a credit history without traditional credit cards.  Take a step back and realize what role the credit card processing company fills.  The only value they provide is that they provide liquidity for consumers, merchants, and banks in exchange for a fee for facilitating the transactions.  The LN would allow you to cut out the credit card processor and deal directly with the lender, whether it be a bank or an individual investor.  That credit account would be reported to the credit bureaus and help you establish a good credit history.

The second part of your question is how to finance major purchases, like cars and houses, by borrowing bitcoins.  When bitcoin is ready, it's price will be very stable. When appreciation is stable, there will be speculators and investors who will be willing to loan their bitcoins out for major purchases in return for interest payments.

"It's hardcoded into segwit that it lowers the fee/kb, I dont know how you can misunderstand that unless you try really hard or have no idea at all what you are talking about.

1sat/byte regularly gets cleared within a few blocks, imo its way too cheap to use the scarce resource that is a distributed ledger. Basically you're saying that you want everything and you want it for free. Fee level will be a tradeoff between price and difficulty to run a node (decentralization). You take decentralization for granted until you don't have it anymore, and then it's too late.  

No blockchain has a working concept that solves anything beyond what bitcoin does. You care so much about picking the ""winner"" that you don't understand what this is about at all.

100% understood but it's not a good thing to have people spending while it's still impractical, could drive some away. It's also a good thing to have lots of people save it while the price increases and then once there is mainstream vendor adoption there will be more people ready to start using it.

"**Shill**

A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.

In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or ""marks"" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working.

bitcoin is a protocol. open-source. it facilitates transactions in a secure manner. its that security that gives it its first-mover advantage and will continue to make it superior to anything that comes later. nothing superior can take its place........ unless a time machine is invented and a blockchain is started and attacked and made resilient over 10 years of its existence.";23;3;False;Ttatt1984;dw1sbb6;"""Bitcoin will be the single global currency of the internet,"" says founder of Twitter & Square";8617n5;https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/976315822397444098

"For anyone interested, here is the article supporting this opinion, though not much of an article: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bitcoin-will-become-the-worlds-single-currency-tech-chief-says-66slm0p6b
> 
> Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade, Jack Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley’s leading entrepreneurs, has said.
> 
> Despite recent weakness in the value of bitcoin and concerns that it cannot currently process transactions fast or cheaply enough to act as a currency, Mr Dorsey, who is chief executive of both Twitter and the payments company Square, believes that bitcoin will overcome these obstacles and will be used to buy everyday items such as coffee.
> 
> Bitcoin is the world’s most popular digital currency and the best-known application of blockchain technology. It exists only as strings of computer code in an immutable, distributed digital public ledger. Created nine years ago, it came to prominence last year as its value rocketed to $20,000, turning some of its early adopters into billionaires in months. Its popularity led to an explosion of rival cryptocurrencies.
> 
> In November, Square said it would enable users in America to buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app. Bitcoin’s value has dropped sharply since then amid fears of a regulatory clampdown and warnings of a bubble. Yesterday it was trading at $8,803.
> 
> Mr Dorsey insisted that virtual currencies built using distributed ledgers would be the next big breakthrough decentralising technology. “The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” he told The Times. This would happen “probably over ten years, but it could go faster”.
> 
> As bitcoin became more widely used, it was up to payment processing companies such as Square to make sure it was widely accepted, he added.
> 
> Mr Dorsey is a bitcoin investor himself and this week was revealed as a funder of a start-up called Lightning Labs, which specialises in a technology that can potentially make bitcoin cheaper and faster to use. His comments highlight a debate among bitcoin enthusiasts about how best to transform it from a store of value into a means of quick and easy payments. Mr Dorsey accepted that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency”.
> 
> “It’s slow and it’s costly, but as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,” he said.
> 
> The entrepreneur is in London this week to promote Square and declined to answer questions about Twitter. He co-founded Square as a mobile payments company in the US in 2009 and brought it to the UK last year. It is known for its small white credit and debit card readers that plug into smartphones and tablets. It offers next-day settlements to merchants in competition with the legacy card payment firms such as WorldPay and Barclaycard and rival start-ups such as iZettle.
> 
> Square is launching an instant deposit service. Merchants can use it to get funds into their bank accounts about 20 minutes after a transaction.
> 
> Mr Dorsey said that cashflow was a huge issue for small businesses and the ability to get paid instantly was crucial in enabling many of them to restock.

Personally, it is hard to imagine Bitcoin with a limited supply and constant hardware based mining to become a single global currency. At one point mining won't be profitable, and the amount of hardware needed to mine will push our energy consumption, plus generate a huge waste, especially in China, since they are not big on recycling.

Hashcash was not a cryptocurrency. Nor was it a blockchain. It was just a proof-of-work mechanism to reduce email spam. It did not compete with Bitcoin in any way.

Bitgold was a proposal. An idea. Never came to fruition. Never actually competed with Bitcoin.
