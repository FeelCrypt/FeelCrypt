"My ledger doesn't receive firmware updates without my connecting the ledger, inputting my pin, and then initiating an update from the computer and approving the upgrade on my ledger.

It isn't entirely impossible the device can be remotely accessed. Your trezor is better in this respect since it's open source, so people have looked at the source and don't see any code that could remotely be used for remote access.

But I've absolutely monitored the traffic going to and from the ledger, and the PC apps are all open source, so they can't perform the remote update unless you manually update them first anyway.

To protect against this attack, you might simply wait until someone you trust has checked the open source PC apps (or check them yourself) before loading them into your PC.

It's wrong to think that anybody could just submit trezor updates to computers all over the internet without getting malware onto our machines first.

Finally, if used as a cold wallet, you can absolutely generate some addresses on one mnemonic with an offline pc, then load another mnemonic for routine use. Even if the trezor is compromised, it will only be aware of the current set of addresses, so it can't compromise the cold wallet addresses that are no longer in memory.

In short, you're being appropriately paranoid, but as long as you keep your trezor offline and maybe watch trezor open source development for signs of remote access, you'll be fine.";4;1;False;HackerBeeDrone;dpll1cr;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/

This is a good comment. The points you raised are why I feel uneasy getting a hardware wallet. You gotta feel 100% sure that there's no funny business going on and I wouldn't be able to get that feeling by trusting that the device is secure. I can, however, create a wallet on an offline computer, memorize the seed and sign the transactions offline as well.

Other thing is. For example for Ledger Hardware Wallets are their business. Why should they scam a handful of people. It makes much more sense to befriend customers satisfy them and build a brand. With cryptos getting more and more public they can build market lead which in the long run can bring them way more money than one time scamming.

"Say I've got the equivalent of 400 BTC in crypto and I want to trade alts. Putting 5% of these 400 BTC on an exchange ain't totally crazy.

I try to never let more than 5% on any single exchange although at time after crazy pumps I went above that. For example I had a huge Sia bag back from when Sia was one of the very last alt to pump although nearly all of them had already pumped, so I loaded waiting for a pump: and when Sia pumped, suddenly I had like 8% of my ""net crypto worth"" on Poloniex (not a safe place to be IMHO) and it took a while to reduce my counterparty risk because I kept hitting daily withdrawals limits.

Never said that at all. Been in this space for 4 years and we are all aware of the risks. But you need people having 21 btc on an exchange to trade/sell to keep the economy going. If everyone followed the rule of keeping all coins off an exchange there would be no coins for you and I to buy. Now what exchange you use without due diligence is another story although history has shown trust != safe. But if you plan on holding only then coins should be in a wallet you control. ;4;0;False;brassbanana;dplt24w;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/

"Electrum 3, which was just recently released, supports SegWit with hardware wallets.  I think it should be possible to sign a transaction on an offline computer using Electrum with Trezor (but I haven't tried it).

Also, even if the Trezor Wallet website requires you to update firmware, you could keep using old firmware with Electrum.

For some protection against malicious firmware, you can compare the firmware fingerprint, shown on the Trezor screen by the bootloader during a firmware update, to the expected fingerprint for firmware built from the open source code.  Even if you don't build the open source code yourself, other people could build it and publicly post the fingerprint.  An old post related to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/4pcb3j/trezor_firmware_update_does_not_show_fingerprint/d4jub17/

The bootloader can also be compared to the open source code, by running custom firmware that reads the bootloader, as discussed in https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2k80rw/trezors_bootloader_source_code_is_now_on_github/  (though, probably most people won't do this; but maybe the fact that some people will do it is enough to keep the manufacturer honest)

"Most improvements in security over trusting the manufacturer require some technical knowledge. For example, you could plug the trezor only into an offline PC and transfer signed transactions via QR code so you can validate that no extra information is being leaked. It's not hard to compile code yourself, it'll certainly take more time though.

Honestly, an offline PC with a program to sign the transactions is even more secure, it's just not remotely as convenient.

">Does Trezor require elevated privilages to update firmware?

No, it uses the same communication channels it uses to transfer the transaction data on. If you can sign transactions on the TREZOR utilising a host machine, that same host machine should be able to also update the firmware. However, I'm under the impression that you need to put the TREZOR into a ""update mode"" (by holding the two buttons while plugging it in, as described [here](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/updatingfirmware.html), then confirming you wish to accept a new update) before it will accept an update. This, of-course, is assuming that the firmware image on your TREZOR is the same one as on Github (Who knows? I know I don't), and the source/firmware/bootloader on Github actually requires that (Once again, who knows? I didn't read the code).

>If all else fails, you could always consider a paper wallet.

"There is a fee for everything. 

So in the simplest sense, you pay a fee to the miners to move your coins from one address to another. You'd pay that fee if you moved it from one Ledger managed address to another, the Ledger to the exchange, an exchange to the Ledger, etc. etc.

Now, what some exchanges do is charge you a flat fee to withdraw. I know Bittrex does this, I assume other places do as well. When you're charged a flat fee, that is generally going to take care of the mining fees plus a little extra for the exchange to pocket. Some exchanges might even pay your fee, just because they already took a lot off the top when you bought BTC from them. You'd have to look. But there is never really anything as a ""free"" transfer - either you're paying the fees at the time of transfer, or you're using a service that has already taken enough money from you to pay the fees.

Plus it’s common to store the mnemonic seed in Cryptosteel in the case there’s something wrong with your HW wallet. Paper is just paper and will always be weaker than most other materials.

Careful, bitcoin.com is advertising Bitcoin Cash as the real BTC, take their information with a grain of salt.

"Well a paper wallet is one option, a hardware wallet with an offline backup is probably better.  Just get a cheap thumb drive and periodically back up your wallet / BTC addresses.  ""Write the entire wallet passkeys"" starts to get dangerous because if you screw up 1 letter you are referencing an address that you don't own.  The idea is just to keep the backup somewhere off the grid, fireproof, floodproof, theftproof.  Anyone who says it has to be paper is just going too extreme.  

Think of your off-grid backup as the bank--you can access the money but it will take some work.  Your on-grid money in your hardware wallet is like the cash you have in your billfold/purse--enough to get through the week/month, but if you plan to buy a car you're gonna have to break into savings.";5;1;False;diesel_rider;dplrcl9;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/

"Electrum's official recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash: https://electrum.org/bcc2.txt

> We recommend to proceed as follows:

 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet, entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds at risk.

Only install [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/) in a separate computer or VM because
> ...the default behaviour of Electron Cash is to silently copy all your Electrum wallets into its own directory.

"Ethereum doesn't support it did it once and bitcoin people hate it because they can't believe other tech uses blockchain and has value that isn't based off a speculative bubble.

Hard forking (more or less) is when you force a change/rollback in the blockchain.  It happened after the first major ""ICO"" in ETH fucked up their contract code and an industrious ""hacker"" siphoned off millions of dollars exploiting a mistake in the code.  This was early on in Ethereum's life cycle, and arguably a mistake that suggested that the blockchain isn't truly immutable but could be manipulated if the consensus was to do so. Call it a 51% attack equivalent.  Since then the team has made it clear they do not intend do that again.

"> Stick to a Linux machine when connecting your hardware wallet

Still doesn't mitigate a manufacturer attack, Windows, MacOSX, Linux, BSD, whatever, if the manufacturer wishes to push a malicious update to the device and you agree (For whatever benefits it adds), you're still fucked.

>only put the machine online when you absolutely have to.

Utilising Trezor's official wallet (Which is the only wallet as of current, I believe, that supports SegWit), you have to have it connected any time you utilise the wallet.

>only send a small amount first to test the legitimacy of the target address before sending larger amounts (protect against clipboard attacks, malware and mask addresses).

As I said, the TREZOR works magic against malware attacks (All of the attacks you described). My issue isn't that, I firmly believe that as long as you follow best practices (Double checking the address on the TREZOR against an out-of-band method/etc...) the TREZOR is secure against anything but the most sophisticated malware utilising unknown zero-days in the TREZOR's firmware. My issue is manufacturer attacks, where they purposely push malicious (signed) firmware to the device. Obviously it'd kill their business, but at that point they've got a kiloshit-ton of BTC.";3;2;False;technifocal;dplk834;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/
">My ledger doesn't receive firmware updates without my connecting the ledger, inputting my pin, and then initiating an update from the computer and approving the upgrade on my ledger.

That's what it claims, but here's my question, and obviously it's hypothetical. What if your Ledger has two update mechanisms, one that allows you to patch small functions without your consent (Like uploading a new function and providing a jump instruction over the existing function, storing it purely in RAM. It'd take like 1-2KB of RAM, something I'm sure the physical hardware has left over), and one that fully overwrites the firmware which requires your consent?

In that example, without your knowledge it could be updated to send your PIN and seed back over the USB data transfer channel.

>It isn't entirely impossible the device can be remotely accessed. Your trezor is better in this respect since it's open source, so people have looked at the source and don't see any code that could remotely be used for remote access.

But I didn't read the code, and even if I (or someone else) did, I didn't compile the code, cross validate it against the firmware that was patched to my device, etc...

And even if I did all of that, who's saying that there isn't firmware on the device that live-patches firmware to add malicious components?

>But I've absolutely monitored the traffic going to and from the ledger, and the PC apps are all open source, so they can't perform the remote update unless you manually update them first anyway.

Monitoring the USB traffic would only help if you were watching the backdoor being utilised live. What happens if the functionality is built in, but not utilised yet? Maybe waiting for even greater adoption until utilisation?

>To protect against this attack, you might simply wait until someone you trust has checked the open source PC apps (or check them yourself) before loading them into your PC.

Unfortunately (From a security point-of-view, it's very convenient otherwise) the Trezor's official wallet is a website, which means the host machine's code could change at any time without an update being directly installed by you. I suppose some sort of Chrome extension could detect changes to the code, but really, who is running that? And even if you did, I wouldn't be surprised if the TREZOR chrome app could modify the code after the first app had already validated it as not having changed.

>It's wrong to think that anybody could just submit trezor updates to computers all over the internet without getting malware onto our machines first.

I don't think ""anybody"" could, I've very clearly detailed this would be a manufacturer attack, nothing else. The manufacturer (Or someone with their signing key & direct access to their web servers to host the malicious firmware for download with their official client) would have to do this.

>Finally, if used as a cold wallet, you can absolutely generate some addresses on one mnemonic with an offline pc, then load another mnemonic for routine use. Even if the trezor is compromised, it will only be aware of the current set of addresses, so it can't compromise the cold wallet addresses that are no longer in memory.

Fair enough, I suppose that is a valid point-of-view, however it somewhat degrades the TREZOR's usefulness as ""easily spendable cold storage"".

>In short, you're being appropriately paranoid, but as long as you keep your trezor offline and maybe watch trezor open source development for signs of remote access, you'll be fine.

Like I said, I do use my TREZOR, I have a decent (In my opinion) amount on it, but I have more than that in a paper wallet because:

1. I don't see myself needing to spend a large amount immediately, and if I do, it's worth the hassle of making a new paper wallet, acquiring my paper wallet from where it is stored, restoring it, sending the money to the destination and the change to my new paper wallet.
2. I honestly don't trust my TREZOR. I trust it more than I trust a wallet on my desktop, but I still don't trust it.
3. My paper wallet doesn't have firmware updates\*.

\*Although I do need to update it soon, as the wallet I used was _not_ BIP{32,39,44,49}. It was an Armory wallet from ~2012-2014 (Not sure), and while Armory still exists, it's a very unique format that is only accepted by that one piece of software (From what I know).

"Put it this way, the TREZOR (in my, unqualified opinion) is theoretically great against malware attacks, but falls short on manufacturer attacks (I.E.

"Your answer and my question are different (I think).

For example, if I had a cryptosteel and the following letters fell out of it:

`aaaaaaaaaabcceeeeeeeeffiiiiiiiiilllmmnnnnooqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrrrrssssstttuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuvzz`

The output from this command:

`$ echo 'acquire antique equal equip frequent inquiry liquid mosquito quality quantum quarter question quick quit quiz quote require square squeeze squirrel unique amazing breeze flavor' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -o '^....' | grep -o '.' | sort | tr -d '\n'`

I immediately know we can discount these 10 words because they contain two bs:

> baby  
> bamb  
> bomb  
> bubb  
> bulb  
> cabb  
> hobb  
> rabb  
> ribb  
> rubb

We can also discount this word because it contains more than two ms:

> mamm

These words due to more than one 'v':

> valv
> velv
> vivi

We have now disqualified 14 words, taking us down to:

1/21841352414974605143073041582941798236684288000th the original problem size. This is only where I get stumped. Obviously, you've only got two ""m""s, so when bruteforcing, let's say you start with:

>some

Then followed up by:

>roma

You immediately know that all the rest of the words in the BIP39 seed contain no ""m""s or ""o""s (we used one m and one o per word, we only had two for the entire seed), we only have three more ""r""s, a handful more ""a""s and quite a few more ""e""s.

You would also know that this seed could never contain the following words (701 of them) as they contain a 'm' or an 'o', which have already been used:

If you're either rich or crypto rich (or both)... I mean: if these 21 BTCs are not your entire life savings, then lawyer up.

I wouldn't hesitate: the second they do that to me, I go to the fanciest fiscal lawyer in my hometown and have him send a letter to Bittrex asking them to give me access to my coins immediately or this would go to court and I'd ask for compensations, my lawyer fees paid for, etc.

They do that to my account and I lawyer up if they don't get their shit in a hurry (as in: I leave them a few days before they have to call their own lawyers).

I suggest you purchase a Trezor hardware wallet. You eliminate the third party risk by using it. Bittrex is a large exchange and I assume they won't cease your money without a valid reason. I guess they froze your assets because they didn't have enough information about you, ie KYC (know your customer). Bittrex have to comply with very strict laws about KYC, which means that if you have an outdated KYC document, for example a two year old bank statement, they might want you to get a new one before you get your money back.

Why don’t you have those in a wallet? On a related note, I had my account disabled last month and it took a week for them to respond to my ticket. My account got false flaged and was put on the OFAC banned list.  I just had to verify some information and the support guy reinstated my account. It was quite frustrating due to lack of communication on bitrex  part and the long time it took to get a response.

Centralized exchanges should be extinct, the same way banks should be extinct. Decentralized exchanges are congruent to cryptocurrenies, while centralized exchanges are taking us back. We're all dependent on governments with centralized exchanges, but we are immune from interference and slave legislation from government through decentralized exchanges.

"Having 120K on an exchange I do NOT find extreme. Serious traders need this amount for larger trades and margin. Making small trades of 500USD does not make sense anymore when you have 21BTC. Normally you would have at least 50K USD open positions (short/long) or something.

"Fake.  FUD.  OP is a liar.

Warning signs and proof:

1- OP pretends to be a day trader and to have $120K stuck at Bittrex, and pretends to give ""10% back to the community as a gift"".

Seriously, someone would really give $12,000 ""to the community"" just like that.  Yeah, sure.

2- The 2nd screenshot of OP ""November 09 Portfolio"" https://i.imgur.com/ev9159y.png lists plenty of balances with completely exact ""round"" numbers:  1000.00000000 , 10000.00000000 , 500.00000000 , 40000.00000000 , 2500.00000000 , 2000.00000000 , etc.

Anyone whom has every purchased bitcoin or altcoins in his life knows that you never get perfectly round numbers - with the % of fees, the rounding, etc. - especially not for **all** your balances, that would magically arrive all at 00000000 digits!  Any normal balance would like like:  1002.10231623 , or 248.74284241, etc.


3- And the last nail in the coffin:  See OP Reddit post history, of just 5 days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7aqza8/how_to_protect_my_bitcoin_before_the_fork_while/

Title:  How to protect my bitcoin before the fork while my funds In Blockchain.Info
> Hello as I mentioned In the title, **Most of my bitcoin savings In blockchain.info** What to do to make sure my coins are safe and how can I access B2X after the fork I'm thinking to move them to Bitcoin core You think It's a good idea? Thanks

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7aqza8/how_to_protect_my_bitcoin_before_the_fork_while/dpc7s0n/

> Thanks guys for the replies, A quick question after the fork storm Is over I can Import private key back Into Blockchain.info Wallet to retrieve B2X or minority chain coins?


4- If that was not enough, OP already pretended to have $125,000 blocked on Bittrex, but on Oct. 13th - 9 days before what he pretends in this post (and bitcoin price was much lower then, so he would have needed much more than 21 BTC to get to this amount).

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/769a8c/decentraland_mana_just_added_to_bittrex/doc9uz3/

> They're [Bittrex] currently blocking my account for more than 125,000$ and without a reason 

So, yeah, Redditor for 5 months pretending to be day trading with $120K US of money (on a single exchange only), whom doesn't know how private keys work on cryptocurrencies.

Good one, you managed to get to /r/all   But you're fake.

"Wow this is crazy and to be honest, I am very surprised at Bittrex for not providing you support to help you out in this terribly stressful time. 

I was locked out of my Bittrex account about a month ago when I upgraded to a new iPhone and forgot to manually re-enter all of my 2FA codes from my Google Auth app. Luckily I contacted Bittrex and they had me provide very detailed information about myself and my account while also sending them a selfie with my passport/license clearly shown. After sending the selfie, they almost immediately turned off my 2FA so I could login.

Some exchanges offer auto-sell addresses. When depositing Bitcoin to these addresses the exchange will immediately execute a market sell order and credit your account. Doesn't really solve the problem but perhaps when your holding fiat on an exchange the laws change a bit.

"I'm an idiot, I thought the whole keeping bitcoin on an exchange was the same as like a wallet/key thing?  I'm kind of just starting to read into all of this because I'm kicking myself in the ass for not investing fucking years ago (mainly due to being a fucking opiate addict up until recently, and that is where all that money went.)  trying to find something so when I do take the plunge (thinking in the next few weeks, gotta pay bills and shit before I can invest anything in anything) to store somewhere safe, I also didn't like the whole idea of an exchange holding my shit, but I thought it was the only option.  Something that made me backout a bit ago when I was sober for a bit was whenever Mtgox happened, that scared me off.  But I've been lead to believe exchanges aren't the only ways of storing your coins.

If there is a thread you could point me in, I'm just about to read the sidebar and double check (I Think I checked it before, but I'm not positive) and see if there is anything that may answer my question.  I constantly get pointed in the direction of coinbase, which I'm fairly certain is an exchange.

*1) Getting verified: Passport (spread), proof of residence, selfie of yourself holding your passport.*

*3) Proving your Email by sending a screenshot of your email box.*

*4) If support doesn't answer send back a ticket or message.*

*5) Some patience and never give mentality (true for everything in life).*

*It was long and painful but in the end if you don't give up you will get your coins back.*

">OP pretends to be a day trader and to have $120K stuck at Bittrex, and pretends to give ""10% back*

He's willing to give 10% if someone can help fix his problem. So what? If he believes his money is really locked up with no hope in sight, then paying people to help doesn't mean anything. If I had a bunch of money tied up in altcoins (looks like he only owns alts) I'd want it out of bittrex ASAP because altcoins are more volatile  
 
&nbsp;
>*completely exact ""round"" numbers:*

When you buy an altcoin with bitcoin on the exchange, it's usually a round number.. That's not unusual at all. Considering everything he owns is an altcoin, this is normal.  

&nbsp;

>How to protect my bitcoin before the fork while my funds  
 
Just because someone is not sure how to split their bitcoin cash safely and is asking for advice does not make them a scammer.  

&nbsp;
>before what he pretends in this post  

I can't understand what your 4th point is so I'll ignore it.


&nbsp;

>So, yeah, Redditor for 5 months pretending to be day trading with $120K  

5th point?: So what if he's a redditor for 5 months and says he has 120K US dollars. That means nothing. Plenty of people have more then 120K US dollars and don't have reddit accounts.

**Everything you said really means nothing. It's all circumstantial.** 
Maybe he is a scammer, I don't know. What I can tell you is your long rant of so called evidence is just mumbo jumbo. 

You didn't convince me of anything there. His username looks weird. Roman numeral 4 followed by 666. But I'm not about to start judging him on that either.

"No. For one thing the account that contains his coins is technically not his. He has no direct control over it. The exchange owns that account that has the money.

Hard forking is not something that can be done lightly. It must be a community consensus on order for that to happen. I'm not convinced that people would be willing to hard fork for anything less than a cataclysmic event. Plus it destabilizes the value of the currency.

"The 2x gangsters are no part of Bitcoin.  It is not in any way theirs. They have no claim to the name of any of the project's resources.

They have only attacked it, and the Bitcoin and Open Source communities.  

To your metaphor.. it's like they made a cheap knockoff and tried to sell it as the bona fide article.  Not even ""like"", that is *exactly* what they have attempted, not only with the 2x scam either...

We've seen so many hostile takeover attempts / scams:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x, etc...

It will not be the last of their hostile takeover attempts. They are destructive imitations.  None of them are Bitcoin.

They are not even legitimate altcoins, and in no way ""forks"".   Trying to steal the name and reputation of another project is shady, shady business. Discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Cryptocurrency.

That's as far as the ""car crash"" metaphor goes.  2x is a fake.  It would have been good to see it crumple.  

Still, good if they have given up on this 2x scam. It was DOA anyway. They don't even have a dev team. Nobody in their right mind is going to trust Jihan and his band of disreputable mining outfits with anything of worth. Not unless they are in on the scam themselves. 

There are plenty of actually trustworthy mining outfits and they have been supporting Bitcoin all along.  Now that SegWit is activated, it's time to get on with safe and sane scaling tech it opens the door for!

Such ""Big Blocks NOW!"" crap from gangsters such as Jihan, Ver & Co is just more propaganda, and again, they are no part of Bitcoin.";1;0;False;Terminal-Psychosis;dpmjzp8;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

"Buying an actual asset is not pure gambling, it's risky in the financial sense, sure, but not as risky as a futures contract. You do actually get the thing you've invested in. If you buy shares in a company, you can actually turn up to shareholder meetings and vote, and you will get paid if a dividend is declared, you actually own a chunk of the company. futures, cfs, bets, swaps etc are different. They are agreements between two parties to exchange money according to some point of reference or calculation, based on a completely unrelated asset which at no point does either party need to own. Some market makers do actually buy assets to hedge the contracts their clients take out, because they make their money via fees, but that's not a feature of the contract. 

If I buy a kilo of gold, whether I take receipt of it in my home, or pay a service provider to hold it for me, I do actually own that gold. Maybe I'm 'gambling' on its value changing, but that's not the same as just placing a bet that the price of gold will increase in the next 7 days by X amount, without ever purchasing any gold. If I'm wrong, I just lose money. If I actually bought gold, and it's value didn't rise by as much as I expected, or drops, I still have it. I can keep it for a long time to see if the price ever gets back to where it was, I can use it, to make jewellery or whatever else.

"Right!

And to be honest, I'm REALLY happy to see someone have identified it as a reason for how volatile this market is.

Once you're fully aware of all the little tricks your mind likes to play on you, you kind of look at the world like: ""oh man, I know this, but look at all these people who are unaware and just fall prey to their own mental biases so often...""

So when OTHER people show they are aware, I get really giddy because I feel like very very slowly the world is waking up and eventually the significance of these biases won't be quite as significant as they are now.

It may have a LOT to do with the no-go on S2X fork.

"I'm fascinated by the phenomenon of ""experience"" and how people negotiate their investment decisions based on the kinds of volatility and results they have personally experienced.

There's a new kind of uncertainty in the air right now for new people (BTC or BCH - one victor?)

"If you don’t want to go off impulse and are looking at the long term investment, I think it would be wiser to go with eth or litecoin during the hype train.

I believe ETH and LTC are far superior to Bitcoin which seems like it’s more of a “stock” than currency  in the past year.

Eth has amazing tech backing it, and Vitalik is a genius who steers the community to technological advancement rather than pushing the “get rich” mentality and hodl memes, he says if you want to make money, design a dApp rather than buy and hold.

Both eth and LTC have much better usability - fast and cheap to use, bitcoin is a pain in the ass to use and will only get worse... 9 year tech is ancient in today’s world.

Ex: I bought 2 games from the same website, one with bitcoin and one with litecoin.
litecoin transaction approved within a minute and cost $0.01 USD.
bitcoin transaction took 4+ hours to approve (I used a higher than average transaction fee) by the time it went through the game was out of stock, took me 2 more days to get it - thankfully support was cool about it.

"Because every rally comes to an end followed by a correction period. Their were strong incentives to consolidate one's portfolio in BTC leading up to the segwit2x fork but now those incentives are gone and as people are re-balancing their portfolios, the rally will lose it's momentum and begin to retrace.

Considering the size of this last rally, I also expect a lot of people to take profits off the table which will also stifle upward momentum.";3;0;False;leon_oswald;dpmlxqc;I bought yesterday.

What a great lesson. It forced me to actually write out a plan that eliminates the emotional hype in my head. And will quell some of the dissapointment when stuff crashes.

It won't be the last time or the last coin to take flight. Happens everyday on something. If I was really worried about BTC's longevity, I would reconsider but I'm not.

"I'm there with you. I decided to take the leap into Crypto finally and I figured this fork would go like most and it would be a good opportunity to get in, earn some free coin, invest in alts, ride all the waves that I've come to see take place around this time etc.
Little did I know that the exact fucking moment I bought, the unthinkable would happen and the fork would be cancelled. Just my fucking luck, and I now know why so many hate these forks, it causes a lot of chaos and division amongst the community. 
I did make a noob mistake of not dollar cost averaging which I knew better to do but it totally slipped my mind when I made the purchase because I was thinking about all my plans for my alt spread, the forked b2x, getting my wallet set up for the fork etc. So I accidentally went all in and transferred it to bittrex so I couldn't just sell off when I heard the news like everybody did. I went ahead and just got out for now at a loss of $600, because at this point that's all I'm willing to take a loss on and I have no idea what is going to happen going forward but excepted a slight correction just not till after the fork. It looks like the correction is happening now so might as well get it out and try to get back in at the bottom maybe and let all the chaos, dust, and fud clear a bit. Oh well, we can just write it off as a capital loss on our taxes. Unfortunately for me this was not a good intro into the space at all, Coinbase was a nightmare dealing with as well.

"I can relate - bought at $4900 when that was an ATH. It dropped the $3300 within a week and like an idiot, I sold and flipped it to ETH, which has had a few blips but overall been stagnant. I just dollar cost average now. Every friday, I put $200 into gemini and just do a market buy. 

There's smarter people than me who can time swings, but on a long enough time scale, bitcoin will continue to go up and up. 

I look at is as in investment that I believe in. I believe bitcoin is the future and will continue to go up in value. It may lose 10% today, 50% next week, but long term I know it will go through the roof. 
Think of it like buying a good company, like a Johnson and Johnson. If the price drops from $140 to $70 per share overnight, it doesn't change the fact that's its a great and valuable company. If anything, I'd just buy more shares at $70!

Then if you invested back in to btc when the price dropped to 200, you could have bought 1875 bitcoins. Then in 2017 when the price hit 7900 this would have been almost 14 million dollars!

"Because traders don't make decisions based on feelings, they follow a strategy. ""Normal"" people make decisions on feelings and lose some value to the traders.

This is why hodling is the way to go. It is very hard to have the balls to drop money into an asset that is freefalling, and that is a requirement to succeed at trading.

Exactly the same is true in stock markets. When something is rising in value normal people start buying it, when in reality they should be unloading it. When a stock has gone down for some time normal people sell it to not take more losses, when in fact they should be buying it.";1;1;False;varikonniemi;dpn297s;I bought yesterday.

"I said that years ago when I bought at like $800; shot up to $1.5k then crashed to $300 (Ball-park numbers). Wasn't going to sell at a loss so just held and basically just ignored the fact that I owned at all. Came back this year - and hey look, that paid off.
