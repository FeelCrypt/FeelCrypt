You directly contradict yourself. The value of the dollar has to be established in exchange for something else. the most pertinent, in the case of a currency, isother currencies. This is exactly what I am arguing. The keep the value of the dollar up relative to other currencies.

"Well that’s the problem. No one is investing in it to use it as currency. The huge inflation of value makes it a completely foolish thing to do. You wouldn’t spend a quarter if you knew it was worth only a dime yesterday. You’d hang onto it, because tomorrow it might be 50cents. 

People spend money because they know it’s worth the same or less tomorrow.  

It’s being bought and sold, but not used as intended. It can’t be used as currency unless / until it stabilizes in value.  If it is known for wild fluctuations, then that absolutely ruins the confidence in its stability which has the effect of ruining its stability. 

So it’s now a commodity with no underlying value (given that its primary purpose has been destroyed with rapid value growth). Stabilization for a few years would help, but it might be too late. The Constant “bitcoin is skyrocketing” narrative certainly isn’t helping long term. It’s helping to add short term speculative value, but that is ultimately unsustainable. Commodities all have function which insures against crashes. Knowing that something like oil has real world value helps to prevent it from simply being valued at 0. Nothing stops bitcoin from tanking to nothing, except people’s belief.  

It has the value foundation of currency (nothing), and is only functional as a commodity. It’s a big problem that no one seems to recognize. But they will. ";1;0;False;crybannanna;doox14q;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

I think it's most likely that the author just used the wrong word and would gladly fix it if notified.  Fixing it would look like this:

">But logically the market should realize

Everything you need to know about how you don't understand economics or human action is summed up in this one quote.  

You believe a ""market"" is a thing that exists, thinks, reasons, has sakes, rights, duties, etc.  A ""Market"" doesn't exist.  It is a descriptive label about a group of individuals.  

Anyway, the explanation for your broader point is: 

1) You're wrong and it's not a Ponzi scheme. 

2) You're right, but those involved believe they can still get some benefit out of it. 

3) You're right, but those involved are subject to the gambler's paradox and don't yet understand it.  


People fall for scams all the time - during their period of ignorance, their actions are logical based upon the information available to them or within the narrow scope of their myopia (willful or not).  Their actions are rational when you consider the data they're basing their actions upon.  Taking their choices out of context is unhelpful and doesn't say anything about whether their actions are rational or irrational.

"Why would I use Bitcoin as a currency over USD? Ignoring deflation/inflation, because deflation actually hurts usage of Bitcoin as currency (if 1btc is worth $6,000 today and $7,000 tomorrow I'm not going to spend that BTC, I'm going to sit on it).

Using USD via CC or even cash is easy and fast and is accepted literally everywhere in the US. Inflation isn't a real concern in the US, although it is in places like Venezuela. Beating inflation with investments is easy enough, and an inflationary currency increases spending and investment relative to a hyper-deflationary currency like Bitcoin. 

I just don't see it taking off as a currency, and worry about those who have leverage over it more than I do the US government controlling the USD. There is enough concentration of BTC holdings and computing power (mining ops) that is an unknown quantity, and unlike some people I trust the anonymous community far less than government, especially insomuch as that community is influenced by nations hostile to my ideals such as China (anti-free speech, authoritarian, etc). That's a concern to me since the majority of mining power and trading volume of BTC is in China (or was, if that's changed recently?) and if they control enough of the system they can alter it. 

If it's going to be used as a currency, it'll have to get faster too - transferring USD to BTC took far too long when I threw a little pocket change in the mix.

"You see the big green bar under the price jump?  That is someone/manyones buying a large volume of bitcoin.

Since stuff like this is based on market/commodity style orders, people buy or sell to these orders.

These buys usually have a target price, and are usually done because of speculation (in a normal commodity, they might be done for actual production demand, but this is a fictional currency with 0 actual production demand).

In short, someone bought a bunch because they want to make money.

After such large buys, the price usually falls slightly, as people sell off at the new price.

I just created my first reddit account because I was intrigued with this post.. So I've been following bitcoin a few years now, and I never bought it up until a month ago.. I bought it at 3600 (5 bitcoins). I thought to myself that trading would make me more money instead of holding and boy was I wrong.. Had I hold my 5 coins I would probably make more than 12K in profits.. But guess what? I sell and trade and when it's all said and done I only profited 1200 dollars. At the time bitcoin kept fucking with my mind... Whenever I buy, bitcoin would either show no movement for days and just decrease in price... And when I sell, bitcoin would just shoots through the roof. Now my money is left in exchange, and I'm trying to get in on the low and hold that bitch.. It's a shame... Went from 5 bitcoin to now I can only buy 2 bitcoin. Hopefully it go down again, so I can get in at 3 bitcoin. Then I'm creating a wallet..  No more trading for me.. Lets see how far it can go up in price... REMEMBER, when bitcoin drops it's a good sign that it will beat the last high.. The more it dip in price the more investment comes in play... I see it happens all the time. Imma be that guy that just going to hold it for the long term. Imagine 1 trillion market cap by in 2018..

Wait a year, then capital gains is 0% up to 70k of your income (gains + whatever you make from work) and 15% from 70k-400k. ;1;0;False;somanyroads;doogoij;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

I also know people far more intelligent than me who believe in bitcoin and completely understand it, and regularly invest, so I copy them and this doesn't go for just bitcoin. Big companies may be hesitant on accepting bitcoin because yes they're putting the company on the line and peoples jobs which is irresponsible. Once the price settles again, they will accept it. Companies dont invest in bitcoin, they take payments to pay it's employees. Although less companies are taking payment, people are paying each other, especially in places like Venezuela.

Bitcoin has the same property of limited supply, but many advantages that gold doesn't have.

"I think your reading comprehension is palpable. 

At no point did I say the BTC is a fancy penny stock, I compared its rise and market reactions (market psychology) to those of penny stock pump'n dump schemes. The current drove of buyers come for one reason only, and that's the meteoritic rise in price, and the following publicity. Volatility alone confirms this. 

Do not for a second think that the majority of buyers are seasoned blockchain experts, or have a deep knowledge in cryptocurrencies. It's PURE speculation at this point. 

What would happen to the divine BTC (or other cryptocurrencies) if some other shiny technology came along, and those smart ""investors"" deemed it to be a better investment? You can try to sell shit for $xxxx a pound, but if there are no buyers, you won't get it sold. 

Same goes for currencies. The buyers ultimately set the price. The S-curve (cumulative adaption curve) fits for successful technologies. It's too early to say if bitcoin will be the winner. Did BetaMax follow the S-curve? No, VHS did. Same goes for cryptocurrencies - some will become winner, others will disappear. And the S-curve will eventually become irrelevant when the next tech comes along and supersedes the previous.  

It sounds like you're too emotionally invested in cryptocurrencies, and simply can't read straight without throwing a tantrum - grow up, or take of your polarized glasses.  ";1;0;False;trackerFF;doof2h1;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

"> *You copy over your Bitcoin keys to wallets that supports the new fork to access those coins*

This might be OK, but the truly paranoid won't do this.

Nobody knows how secure the new wallets are. There hasn't been enough time to study the source code and ensure there are no backdoors. And the people behind the fork haven't proven to be trustworthy.

To keep your bitcoin safe, you need to ensure the private keys in your wallet are safe. If you keep your wallet encrypted and ideally offline, you're safe.

That means it's not safe to just ""copy over your bitcoin keys"" to the wallet for the new fork. That wallet could steal your private keys and steal your bitcoin.

So here's how to do it securely.

1) Transfer your bitcoin out of coinbase into a Bitcoin Core (bitcoin.org, not bitcoin.com) encrypted wallet you keep locally on your own computer (or better yet, multiple copies offline on multiple new USB drives that have never been used for anything else).

2) Wait for the fork.

3) After the fork, keep waiting at least a week or two more to make it unlikely transactions can be replayed.

4) In Bitcoin Core, make a brand new wallet that doesn't contain your old keys. Transfer your funds from the old addresses in the old wallet to the new addresses in the new wallet. Now the addresses that held bitcoin before the fork are empty, and the new addresses in the new wallet hold your funds.

5) Keep your new wallet encrypted and offline.

6) Now that your bitcoin funds are safe, you can copy the old keys into the forked wallet. The funds you had before the fork in the old addresses will show up there, and you can shapeshift them out of the forked chain back to bitcoin if you wish.";31;3;False;procsy;dooli8z;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png

"> Anything that makes like (life?) simpler, accuracy be damned, I guess.

I think promoting this sort of thinking is one of the main ways Donald Trump attracted voters. He gave people who don't practice complex thought (unfortunately a very large percentage of the country) what they like best, simple answers to extremely complicated issues. All economic issues are clearly China's fault, or all crime is clearly just committed by Mexicans and Muslims. Those examples clearly aren't true (to people who think critically), but that essentially was/is his message. In reality, complex problems have complex, multifaceted solutions that aren't possible to simplify into one or two words. However, people who don't understand this wanted someone to blame for why their lives aren't what they want or why they're scared and Trump gave it to them. They gave him their vote. Therefore it's not at all surprising to me to find a Trump supporter spouting such simple and inaccurate drivel.

That has two answers:

(1) That's  because Satoshi hadn't discovered the malleability bug. If he had discovered it, he'd have implemented something like Segwit himself.

(2) Depends on whether you think the EDA to be more significant in its impact than Segwit, which does seem to me to be the case, as the EDA causes Bitcoin Cash to oscillate between one block every few hours and one block per minute.

"#Why the Bitcoin rules can't change (reading time ~5min) 

Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.


First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.


Myth: Miners set the rules by voting


False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.


But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE


I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, **your client also validates**. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, **your client is coded to simply ignore them**, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules.


The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.


Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.


Right now you are **sovereign** in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.


What do I mean by sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change. But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

"Okay, here's the fundamental situation. Right now, there's one ledger (blockchain), that has a record in it saying ""/u/Whonucknuck has Y coins"". When a split happens, that means there's now two ledgers (two forks in the blockchain), and each of them derived from the same history, so now there's two records that say ""/u/Whonucknuck has Y coins"", one on each fork. So, you then have Y coins over here, and also Y coins over there. But they are two distinct things in two separate accounting ledgers, so you can say you now have Y coinA coins, and Y coinB coins.

The question then becomes, which one do you care about? You could either say that one of the two is ""Bitcoin"" and carries with it the monetary value the original ledger had at the moment of the fork, or you could say the other one is ""Bitcoin"". And that is one of the key cruxes of this whole debacle is about. But unlike a standard Democracy where those in favor of the minority option _have_ to acquiesce if they're outvoted by the majority, if you control your private keys, you can pick for yourself, and the minority group could become the genesis of a brand new community.

So, you as a user after the fork have a few main options to pick from:

**Pick one coin and ignore the other completely**. You say coinA is your new ""Bitcoin"", and you think coinB will just shrivel up and die shortly. So, you can just find others who believe the same, and follow news updates about that coin, and continue on your merry way. The downside of this option is that when you send your coins (e.g. ""I, /u/Whonucknuck sends Z coins to /u/MidnightLightning""), if you're not doing anything to prevent it, _both_ ledgers will record that transaction. So in effect, you actually sent me Z coinA coins **and** Z coinB coins (But you said you don't care at all about coinB, so you ignore that).

**Pick one coin and sell the other**. If you say coinA is your new ""Bitcoin"", and you don't want to support coinB at all, you can sell your coinB coins in exchange for coinA coins. To do that you need to find someone with the opposite view from you (someone who thinks coinB is the new ""Bitcoin"" and wants to get rid of all their coinA coins). You swap with them, so you end up with twice as much coinA coins, and they end up with twice as much coinB coins. If the communities supporting the two coins are fairly evenly-split, these sort of 1:1 trades will be possible. But if one side turns out to be in a big minority, and the majority on the other fork wants to dump all their minority coins, the majority would likely be willing to do so at a loss, trading 2:1 or more, driving the price down of the minority coin. Choosing this option, you've made a profit in coinA coins (as much as doubling your share, but possibly just earning an additional fraction on top). But if you're wrong and the community shifts away from coinA to coinB, you may find the purchasing power of your stash is diminished from what it was (Bitcoin Cash users are in that situation now).

**Keep both coins**. You can just keep your assets of both, making sure to keep transactions separate when sending coins to other people (""replay protection""). You don't loose any coins that way, and initially your portfolio will be worth  twice as much! However, likely one of the coins will start losing some value (whichever is even slightly in the minority), and the longer you hold the minority coin, likely the lower the price will go, so the benefit of keeping both will diminish over time, likely. And at some point you may wish to cut your losses and sell one coin or the other, but that's up to you.

That's only a problem if you intend spend coins AND keep your (remaining) coins on both forks.

"> 3) After the fork, keep waiting at least a week or two more to make it unlikely transactions can be replayed.

If you're just moving your coins from your own address to a new address, time alone won't be enough to prevent replays. Only if the coins moving contain in the same transaction coins from a coinbase transaction after the fork would that guarantee replay protection.

If neither side creates replay protection, I believe the next best way is if one side has significantly less hash power, you can do it with a ""replace by fee, not valid until block height X"" transaction. Pick a block height at the tip of the longer side, and transmit. As soon as the longer chain confirms, you have until the slower chain reaches that height to broadcast a replace by fee transaction (higher fee than the first) to send it somewhere else.

"It's very much alike.

If you're familiar with Git, commits are organized in a chain, with each commit referencing a previous commit, forming a history/branch. A fork in git is two commits referencing the same previous commit, meaning the branch splits into two after some point.

In Bitcoin, the blockchain is much like a Git branch, with each block being like a commit, referencing a previous block. The main difference is that every block is signed in a way that requires a lot of computational effort —which is not required in Git— so after a few blocks are chained one after another and signed each on its own, it becomes extremely difficult to modify any of them and still keep the signatures valid. The signing process is also distributed, so people (miners) compete with each other to see who gets to be the first one to come up with a valid signature... and the process of deciding which signature is valid, is also distributed, which a series of rules coded into the software that accepts or rejects blocks which meet them or don't, thus deciding whether to use them or not as the base block for the next one.

A fork in the blockchain is quite similar to a fork in a git branch: at some point, two or more people create blocks that would follow the same original block.

Normally, only one of these blocks would be picked as ""the next block"", based on the rules coded in the software... but if some people are running different software versions with modified rules, then some people might pick one block, while other people might pick another and keep building their chain upon it. This leads to a fork in the blockchain, to people potentially receiving several kinds of blocks and only accepting the ones that match their blockchain and the rules their software is enforcing to build upon, with a blockchain that is united up to a point, and splits/forks/branches from some point onwards.";21;1;False;jarfil;dooks4w;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png

"If you fired up an old Bitcoin node, say 0.10.0 for example, you'd sync and follow right along with the latest Bitcoin Core developments all these years later. Your client wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, Bitcoin Gold fork, or the Segwit2x fork. It would follow the original chain, noted as the furthest removed ""fork"" (Segwit1x) in the first picture. This is what the second picture is saying.

The owner of Bitcoin.com, creator of the first chart, has made a public bet of 1000 Bitcoins (currently over 6m USD) that Segwit2x will overtake the current chain. The futures market, which allows people to trade on the upcoming fork ahead of time, shows the opposite happening. So it's in his best interest to change the narrative.

I think the censoring has been toned down a lot now, and it happens less and with less abstract rules. But initially some of the censoring that happened here left a bad taste in my mouth. I tried the other sub for a while, but I thought the r/btc users were unusually hostile and found myself coming back here for discussions. I'm still not completely happy with how this sub is run, but I don't think it deserves the hate it once earned.

Ironically, /r/btc seems to be against BTC now, and in support of BCH (aka Bitcoin Cash). One thing the BCH fork does is raise the blocksize to 8MB, which you could argue is *closer* to Satoshi's original suggestion, but it also messes with the difficulty adjustments in a way he was strongly against. Without another hard fork to fix this difficulty change (called the EDA), there's a good chance BCH will hit their halvening years ahead of schedule, and complete their mining much further ahead of schedule. This is a problem as there isn't enough of an economy established yet to incentivize miners to mine blocks without fixed payments. This change also means blocks are mined at less than a minute for days, and other days blocks are further than an hour or two apart.

Not to get too technical, but the big argument in favor of not having an unlimited block size is that it doesn't scale well. With a 1MB block size, there's a max of 7 transactions per second. On blackfriday there's 150m transactions, or 1736 a second. So the blockchain is growing 1GB every 4 seconds. This is roughly 38TB a single day.

Again, oversimplifying to keep things from becoming too technical, Segwit, while being backwards compatible, makes it easier for offchain transactions, such as those on the Lightening Network. (There was some FUD about the Lightening Network (LN), but it's open source and doesn't give any of the developers kickbacks or patent payments or anything like that. Banks hate it as much as they hate Bitcoin. Etc.) The offchain transactions that are possible with something like the LN can easily crush the current credit card processing limits with just the 2 to 4mb blocksize limit segwit grants.

The two subs still come down to the Bitcoin Core developers vs not. Core is still the most actively developed, and best tested Bitcoin node. The core git repository is literally 1000s of commits ahead of it's closest fork, the segwit2x client. Other attempted forks have suffered from lack of development, bugs, and exploits. This has kept the core client in the strongest position. This is why there isn't much market confidence in the segwit2x fork. A dangerous exploit which could have resulted in the loss of people's bitcoins was recently patched out of the segwit2x client - thanks to core developers btw.

There have been so many attempts from different parties to take control of Bitcoin. But there's so much money and power involved, this is bound to happen. It makes it really hard to judge people's intentions and can lead to some bad actors. I feel the core developers are still working with Bitcoin's best interest in mind, and will win out in the long run. But if not, all the Bitcoins you had at the start of the year will also exist on multiple other chains and you can just choose to use one of those instead.";10;1;False;DannyDaemonic;doojw42;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png

"This is correct. A soft fork uses internal governance to adjust rules = one Chain. Within context of Bitcoin, this means like ‘all passwords must be 8 characters’ to ‘all NEW passwords must be 12 characters’ and so on. The rules can become more restrictive, but never less, without a hard fork (as I understand).

A hard fork resets the rules or ‘constitution’. If there is programming, money, or social backing, then another constitution is always possible. This can happen at anytime.

However, practically speaking, persons prepare for such an event and then wait for a period of social unrest (such as a ‘necessary’ soft / hard fork), and then try to introduce their chain at said time of confusion & fear.

There could be a new Bitcoin fork everyday, but it simply wouldn’t get much press unless it coordinated its timing with other controversial events, and presented itself as the ‘neutral arbitrator’, ‘for the people’, etc.

Each hard fork can effectively reset all rules, if they want. I don’t know how it affects accumulated Hash power, etc (like will BGold have the historical Hash power of Bitcoin, or restart from 0?).
