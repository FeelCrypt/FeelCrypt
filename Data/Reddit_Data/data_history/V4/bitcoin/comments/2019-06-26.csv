"Bitcoin will never exceed more than 21,000,000 in quantity. No one can change that.

If an online video game company comes along and created 100 ""Sword of Truth""s, noting they would never make more, they easily could break their own rule at the risk of pissing off 100 users. But if the company wants to expand and reach more members they could make 1,000 more of them. 

Bitcoin exceeding 21mm coins would break the protocol, and it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.

If you own a single Bitcoin, there are only 20,999,998 people who could ever have more Bitcoin than you. And what happens when no one wants to sell their Bitcoin for less than $100,000 each?

There’s been so much speculation about the cyclical nature of bitcoin over the last 9 years. Moonmath.win has a logarithmic cycle that is unbelievably accurate as far as value stores go. So it could be a system of cyclical supply and demand and were seeing larger quantities of people slowly move value into bitcoin due to various economical factors. I do agree though with everything you’re saying and that a new ATH is pretty much necessary to maintain the cycle. Otherwise I’m not sure what we’ll be looking at lol. it definitely has some tie to the down turns in economies and currencies globally. It’s too coincidental that negative stuff to the USD happens and then btc goes up.;10;2;False;d-dub3;es3h8sd;Me waking up to bitcoin this morning;c5njc4;https://v.redd.it/t5yxcfbe2o631

A limit order is an offer the sell something for price X. The opposite of a limit order is a market order. A market order is buying or selling at the best price currently available on the market.

Anytime your local currency is shitting you’re going to move your money into the quickest and historically best earning asset on the market - btc.

So it definitely plays a factor.

"In mid November of 2017, I sold a big chunk of my bitcoin holdings after it had grown 1,000% in 11 months basically because it had become too risky (as a percentage of my portfolio) to keep it in bitcoin. I did so, even though 2 weeks later it got as high as $20,000, because there was so much uncertainty (what would happen when future trading opened, Lightning Network was just starting to be used, high fees were weighing on people's perception of it as a ""currency,"" people were still trying to use the ""BTC is only for criminals"" narrative, etc. etc.) 

This time around, it feels completely different. I still hold bitcoin but my confidence level is completely different. Maybe it's because I'm a grizzled veteran and have lived through a huge downturn. I think it's more because of the sentiment out there. 

Thanks to the community and development of bitcoin over even the last 18 months, virtually ALL of the above things mentioned above no longer are being mentioned. Credit to the Bitoiner's who are the ones really driving this bus. 

I really believe this is the proof it's not about price. Price follows growth, development/advancement in BTC.";3;1;False;bitcointheboardgame;es3pmso;Me waking up to bitcoin this morning;c5njc4;https://v.redd.it/t5yxcfbe2o631

"I'm gonna tell you a story about a guy called enzo_the_cat. He was an early adopter that saw insane gains within the first year of mining and trading. ""This is awesome, he thought, now I can get a BMW E39 M5!"". So he sold. 

Now, if he had sold a couple of years later, that E39 M5 would have been a Mclaren (because Lambos are tacky). 

But here's the twist: he kept some of his most precious cryptos. Because he believed in the tech, the awesome community and because some drunk guy had told him to ""hodl"".

Does he regret his decision? NO. Because he had some of his best memories with that M5. And some of those memories where worth a lot more than a stupid Mclaren. Because he met the love of his life on a BMW car meet. 

And, since he is a true hodler, he will always have BTC. No matter what the market thinks it's worth at the moment. He is not rich, but from time to time he sell off some to fund the most important thing in life: life itself. To him, Bitcoin is the ultimate commodity of freedom.

">There doesn't necessarily need to be more ""volume"" for the price to increase. If everybody decided to not sell any of their bitcoin, the price would increase indefinitely until someone decided to sell, which would be the new asking price.

That would only be the case if there was absolutely 0 elasticity in demand and no limit on the amount of wealth in the world. For any demand elastic good, you can't just constrict supply and expect demand to stay constant and price to increase because people aren't willing or able to buy as much of something that costs $1,000 as something that costs $1.

In the case of speculative demand its slightly more complicated since people don't actually want the asset for any reason other than to make money, so immediate economic substitution isn't as obvious. It doesn't matter if $5 of copper can do the job of $500 of gold if all you want gold for is for it to be worth $600 and copper isn't increasing in value as fast.

In order for someone to pay a billion dollars for a bitcoin for anticipated speculative gain, they'd have to believe they could make speculative gains on that billion dollar bitcoin, meaning finding someone else being willing to pay more than a billion dollars. For the person who bought a bitcoin at 6 cents and sells it for a billions dollars its a great deal. Is anyone going to believe they can buy a bitcoin for a billion dollars and sell it for 16 quintillion dollars, which is the equivalent gain? No.

So there's a natural form of diminishing returns with any purely speculative asset as a consequence of needing exponentially more money to see the same gains, and since most speculators are attracted to a high rate of returns, they will naturally switch away from speculating on things as they hit diminishing returns which is why speculative bubbles are shorter lived the faster they grow.

""everyone just decided not to sell at a lower price"" is not an explanation. No one wants to sell at any lower price than they have to. Something has to have happened to change peoples willingness to sell.";1;2;False;suninabox;es42puu;13,0000 boys, we’re vertical again;c5rwel;https://i.redd.it/vv9hnuz19q631.jpg

"> First of all, there is an ""unlimited"" amount of ""wealth"" in this world for as long as governments are allowed to print money.

Money isn't wealth, its a token for wealth. If you double the amount of money in the world you don't double the amount of wealth, each unit of currency now represents half as much.

>You say, ""It would take 21 quadrillion dollars to pay 1 billion dollars for every bitcoin"" but you're just using a number that sounds big and scary today to refute my argument.

I'm talking about the actual amount of wealth a billion dollars buys right now, i.e. adjusted for purchasing power, i.e. the value of a dollar right now in 2019, not the value of a dollar after you've printed quadrillions of dollars. It would make no sense to say ""bitcoin could go up to a billion dollars"" if what you actually mean was bitcoin staying exactly the same value as it is now but dollars just becoming worth less. What matters is the purchasing power adjusted value. How much gold, steel, wheat etc you can buy with each unit of currency.

If you printed 21 quadrillion dollars you would not make 21 quadrillion dollars of wealth in order to exchange for bitcoin. For how much wealth there is in the world, at the current value of the dollar, there is not more than 300 trillion dollars of wealth in the world at most.

Saying ""bitcoin could be worth a billion dollars! (so long as it means hyperinflating the dollar so that now a billion dollars is only worth what $10,000 was worth in 2019)"", is a dumb trick. When people are talking about bitcoin being a million dollars they mean in present value, they don't care if bitcoin is worth a million dollars because the dollar is now worth less. Bitcoin is worth trillions of dollars right now if you don't mind them being zimbabwean dollars.

>Yes you can expect demand to stay constant because of a unique feature that bitcoin has, it's infinitely divisible

That's not a unique feature of bitcoin. Banks and private payment processors regularly move thousandths of a cent, they could move trillionths of a cent if they wanted to. Most money is just numbers on a computer somewhere.

"No you're completely wrong. 

First of all, there is an ""unlimited"" amount of ""wealth"" in this world for as long as governments are allowed to print money. If governments decided to buy bitcoin the price would go up so much it would hyper-inflate most currencies, because they can create money at will. 

Yes you can expect demand to stay constant because of a unique feature that bitcoin has, it's infinitely divisible. You're right, if something increases from 1 to 1000 dollars that would put it out of the price range of most people, but if I could divide that object almost infinitely then that barrier wouldn't be there and I could still buy a fraction of what you're selling for the money that I have available to invest. 

You say, ""It would take 21 quadrillion dollars to pay 1 billion dollars for every bitcoin"" but you're just using a number that sounds big and scary today to refute my argument.

"There doesn't necessarily need to be more ""volume"" for the price to increase. If everybody decided to not sell any of their bitcoin, the price would increase indefinitely until someone decided to sell, which would be the new asking price. 

This happens on a global scale every second of every minute across hundreds of exchanges, the average price across all of those exchanges is the one you see on CMC. (which is why the price you see on coinbase is always slightly different than CMC, CMC just takes the average of all exchanges to get a global average price) 

But if nobody on earth ever sold bitcoin again, and millions of people were all bidding to try to buy those bitcoins, the price would just increase vertically until there was enough supply to meet that demand. Everyone has a price they'd sell bitcoin at, but in theory, if bitcoin is truly ""priceless"" the price could hit a million, a billion, you name it. 

That's what's happening now. People always look too heavily at the demand side of the supply and demand equation, that's a fallacy. Supply and Demand are equally important in determining the price of a finite asset.

In short, if demand stays constant and all of a sudden supply gets greatly restricted, the price will go up without any new ""volume"" entering the marketplace. But alas when the price goes up people tend to pay attention and demand/volume increases as well, which creates the snowball affect you're seeing now.";41;5;False;;es3vjp8;13,0000 boys, we’re vertical again;c5rwel;https://i.redd.it/vv9hnuz19q631.jpg
