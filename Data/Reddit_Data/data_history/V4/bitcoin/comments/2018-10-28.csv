Please beware there are many fake bitcoin mining/clouding out there, I got scammed twice before I met a genius hacker who helped retrieve my bitcoin. The whole plan was so smooth I could not doubt it. Bitcoin is actually a great investment option but one thing I discovered over time is that it is not possible to mine bitcoin so donâ€™t be deceived. I invested $25000 on a particular website called eurekaminingblock, I monitored the profit yielding but got locked out of the account before I could withdraw. I went online and met this hacker bitcoinretrievalgenius who helped me retrieve my bitcoins back in few hours. You saved my life and I will forever be grateful. I referred my friends whom we got scammed together right away and they got help too. You can contact bitcoinretrievalgenius gmail com. Thank me later!;1;0;False;GregAnthony1477;e8m8eof;Bitcoin investment was a great idea;9kp8x6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kp8x6/bitcoin_investment_was_a_great_idea/
