I tried to get my dad to invest in bitcoin 6 years ago. He had no job and no money but he inherited 700,000 dollars from my grandma passing away. He ended up investing in real estate. My parents are divorced and I thought there was a lot of potential in bitcoin. He ended up buying 7 houses in North Carolina and was renting them out. He basically lives off the money he makes through that and makes about 3000 a month. He bought the houses in a short sale but I calculated it and if he invested in bitcoin it would be worth close to 40 million dollars. I still regret not investing myself. I had saved 2000 dollars over the summer from working and instead of saving or investing I cashed out and bought a computer. I was 13 by the way.;5;2;False;Oogutache;dxrafnj;Rekt;8dyjg3;https://i.redd.it/os7rw10wrbt01.jpg

"> So much speculation and dreamy eyed optimism in there I don't want to begin

It's funny because I'm the last to be called dreamy eyed. I'm not totally sold to the tech for that very reason. There are a million real world hurdles for ever becoming fully effective.

I was explaining to you how valuable the tech is *in theory*, not in practice. Aviation back in 1900s was ultra valuable as well but if some guy went along and said it may not ... take off ""for this, that and another"" reason, I'd agree with him.

But if there was another guy (you) saying that it won't work even in theory I'd disagree and give him (you) an ideal progression of things.

Truth is, aviation became big early due to the two WW and the immediate need of it that they presented, without them we may still be flying on monoplanes... but the value in the idea/tech was *there* all along... which is exactly what I'm telling you (about the blockchain). Not that it will take off, I'm as sceptical as you, but why it is *actually* a good idea that may well not take off.


Btw learning code is a relatively easy skill. It's like me telling you that the entire premise of buying stuff is learning basic arithmetic, but guess what, an increasingly mathematized world forced people to, and most are naturally good with arithmetics anyhow ... as will be with code once society becomes digitized enough. We're the first gen of overt digitilization , give it another 50-100 years and see how basic coding would be a common knowledge... it cannot not be...";1;0;False;Steven81;dxsrnhg;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"Pretty much every community you're in in real life is self-moderated.  And the early internet was as well, at least with email discussion groups.  You pay attention to the content you are interested in, and ignore, or even personally censor, content that you are not interested in.  The whole system is censorship free because it's decentralized.  You get to control only what you say and pay attention to, but you don't get to interfere with what anyone else says or gets to hear/see.  That's the only healthy way to have a system, since it removes discrimination by the majority.

This is why Bitcoin was invented.  It's obviously not perfect, and isn't really decentralized, as the developers have the ultimate say in how it works, but the ideology behind Bitcoin is to at least have it be as egalitarian as possible, with the control being open to anyone who wants to participate and has the resources to do so, instead of being governed entirely by corporations.

When some group gets to tell everyone else what they can and can't do, we automatically both miss the chance to use the resources that the repressed individuals have to offer, but we also cause them to act aggressively in retaliation, in some way.  Which is why you see so much spam, trolling, conflict, and generally negative interactions in these kinds of communities.  If you want healthy interactions, you don't start out from the beginning by harming people (using force/violence in some way, physically, emotionally, intellectually, or philosophically to prevent them from doing what they would really like to do).";1;1;False;Turil;dxrzjzl;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"I didn't say it was stolen from blockchain. You've missed my point. My point is that blockchain does not exist in a vacuum of perfect space. to function in REAL society it requires the same amount of trust that current systems do.  And that trust has already been violated. 

You're defending blockchain as if it was still a theoretical paper. Not actually working in reality. And in reality we see that it's not a better system at all.  And even if you could lay out a very long winded answer to why you think it IS better, the debate shows that it's at best, marginally better. Which doesn't argue well for turning the entire system upside down. We already have an anonymous way to make transactions, it's call CASH. 

>So I don't trust anyone but myself, that's the point of using a trustless system.

Perhaps you are very skilled at writing software. When the seller
proposes the smart contract, you take an hour or two to make sure that the contract will withdraw only an amount of money equal to the agreed-upon price, and that the item ‚Äî rather than some other file, or nothing at all ‚Äî will actually arrive. The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed ‚Äî that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal 50 million dollars. But yours wont. It‚Äôs not trustless, you‚Äôre trusting in the software (and your ability to defend yourself in a software-driven world), instead of trusting other people.

In the end you have to rely on one of four things,
each of them characteristics of the ‚Äúold way‚Äù: 
either the author of the smart contract is someone you know of and trust, the seller of the item has a reputation to uphold, you or friends of yours have bought items from this seller in the past successfully, or you‚Äôre just willing to hope that this person will deal fairly. In each case, even if the transaction is effectuated
via a smart contract, in practice you‚Äôre relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself.";1;1;False;DeathbyOstrich;dxreyws;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"> decentralised payment processors 

You still need to trust them.

>I'm relying on my capacity to read code alone

MOST people cannot. 

>To do that we can have coding being taught alongside reading and math on all people, we have to standardise the way those contracts are written (so that anything going on in them can be a semi-general knowledge).

A ton of requirements for all this change. For not much gained. Not enough gained to spur the change that you say is needed. It's almost silly.

">  Blockchain is trustless

yes. but the software need to exchange isn't. 

> (yet you ignored)

No I didn't. The entire premise of your assertion rests on *everyone* learning to code, or trusting someone, or something else to handle their coin.  Which is not any different than what we have now. 

>You do realize that 30-50% of wealth production is lost to corruption each year, right? A trustless system cannot be circumvented. I cannot think of anything more valuable than several dozens of trillions each year. Like literally, everything is puny compared to that.

So much speculation and dreamy eyed optimism in there I don't want to begin.

"No you defined the blockchain as if it is a theoretical structure. Since I've actually used it end-to-end I didn't.

Obviously it's not a tech ready for mass adoption, which is why it is in speculation phase, but it *is* functional end-to-end.

If you want mass adoption you'd need decentralised exchanges and decentralised payment processors playing the role of the ""3rd parties"" that we currently have...

>In the end you have to rely on one of four things, each of them characteristics of the ‚Äúold way‚Äù

Not really, I don't rely on any of those, there is nothing revolutionary in doing that. I'm relying on my capacity to read code alone, that never happened before. Just one piece of ""book knowledge"" to secure me against anyone and everything, I only trust myself.

No system has ever given that in the past. I always had to trust unelected ""masters""  in anything I ever did. Just one of them being a crook it was always enough for corruption to start ... and guess what , they/it always was. It's basically how corruption works on a trust-heavy system, even if 99.9% of the system being honest 0.1% is enough to create a great economic (or otherwise) loss.

 It's an asymmetric danger. Basically what the blockchain solves. Basically all you need is to know how to read smart contacts. To do that we can have coding being taught alongside reading and math on *all* people, we have to standardise the way those contracts are written (so that anything going on in them can be a semi-general knowledge). Heck for those who don't want to learn coding they'd only have to trust just one person (just one who reads the contract) instead of myriad others as it stood with the current system.

It *completely* eliminates the trust issue if you are open to learn coding and minimise the danger if you don't.

Yeah, that's revolutionary by my counting. Especially if more and more institutions adopt it, creating a trustless layer wherever the connections between  institutions/people exist (so you can always check *all* the steps of your ""transaction"").";1;1;False;Steven81;dxrzgl9;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/
"> You still need to trust them

You don't if they use the blockchain to decentralize. Blockchain is trustless

> MOST people cannot.

Which is why I included most of everything else I wrote (yet you ignored).
In brief:
A) you only need to trust one (the one who reads the code for you)
*or* (b) you only have to learn one skill. A *stark* contrast to what currently exists.

> unrealistic

As unrealistic as people knowing basic math and reading 100 years ago.
