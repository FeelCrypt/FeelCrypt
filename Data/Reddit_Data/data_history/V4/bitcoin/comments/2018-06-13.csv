"Only Bitcoin has an extensive network of nodes to enforce that scarcity. If Bitcoin Cash actually had full 32 MB blocks (their current limit), it'd instantly centralize, and then be trivial for the government or another party to inflate the supply. The touted ""coin limit"" of a cryptocurrency is meaningless unless you can enforce it. ";1;0;False;vakeraj;e0ksxcy;That's why you come here;8qety0;https://i.redd.it/mqyor0jn0h311.png

Just curious, why is it you believe Bitcoin (BTC) is the only uninflatable currency...?  BCH or BTG have the exact same supply limit as BTC, for example, and some other crypto-currencies also have a hard supply limit with diminishing mining rewards and are likewise set to be deflationary rather than inflationary over time.;1;1;False;sph44;e0kqvfr;That's why you come here;8qety0;https://i.redd.it/mqyor0jn0h311.png

"> The price declines every year. Doesn't go up every year.

Are you talking about Bitcoin?  June 2018 it's hovering around $7K, June 2017 it was around $2K, June 2016 around $500, June 2015 around $200-250.  If you go back 8 years it was worth less than 1 cent.  So could you explain what you mean when you say the price declines every year...?

"Sir Tim Berners-Lee released the internet for free to the world without a trademark or patent, even though he knew had he applied those things he would have become the richest man in the world overnight.

But he also recognised the Internet (TM) would have then become a diaspora of corporate Intranets that would have meant humanity having no ability to access one universal source of knowledge via a single TCP/IP layer.

Satoshi released bitcoin without patent, trademark or brand in the exact same manner.
