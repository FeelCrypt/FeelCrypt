"Yeah, but if Bitcoin fixes its issues via second layer tech like Lightning, and then goes on to add what amounts to an ‚Äúopen world‚Äù programmable environment with side chains, then goodbye alt coins. 

Lightning is now in beta on MainNet and so is RootStock. And everything is looking very good. 

Bitcoin is the only battle-tested turtle in this race, with a massive head start.

"In that case I'll give you a very clear example that has been tried and tested: Litecoin. At this point in time, there is absolutely no reason to use Bitcoin over Litecoin. Litecoin can do absolutely everything Bitcoin can do, except faster, and cheaper. Things have gotten so bad for Bitcoin that it is cheaper to sell your Bitcoin for Litecoin, incur market fees, do a speedy on chain LTC transaction and incur cheap LTC transaction fees, and THEN buy back into BTC on the next exchange, rather than doing an absurdly slow and ridiculously expensive on chain transaction using BTC. That's how bad things have gotten. At this point, there is zero reason to use BTC over LTC. It's so bad that I actively advise crypto newcomers to avoid Bitcoin pretty much all together. 

All the BTC fanatics ever have to respond with is that the lightning network is coming, and that it will turn everything around! But guess what, it's not here, and likely won't be anytime soon. Bitcoin can't even do smart contracts to give it some added utility. ""But but but, Rootstock!"", sorry, that's not here yet either. This has always been the common theme and the talking point with BTC. Bitcoin can just implement the upgrades that newer blockchains implement, but it never ends up happening. Back in the day the hype was colored coins, today its lightning and rootstock. Same shit, different year.

"How in the world are they pushing? They are having extreamly exclusive clinical trials to tests it's not ffectivness in treating PTSD because other scienctist have done this thing called gathering evidence and have found that MDMA has potential to help with PTSD. If you were not such a fucking moron you could very easily look up the history of MDMA and see that it was originally making strides in use for therapy before it hit the rave scene and the government banned it. Just because some people abused it doesn't mean it magically loses its benefits. MAPS has existed since 1986. This is not some new thing. They have led the way in countless studies on the drugs effictivness and potential for helping people. The fact that you don't give a shit about that is sickening. 

Why don't you quit with your strawman bullshit (I'm sure you'll have to look up what the strawman fallacy is too since you clearly haven't seen a classroom since highschool so I'll wait).... My comments and arguments are directed at you misrepresenting what MAPS is. What the pineapple fund sounds their money on is irrelevant to that topic. Feel free to bitch about them not donating to starving African children all you want but that's not what I commented about (hence building up a straw man to detract from the actual point of my comments since you are unable to argue against them). 

You are seriously ignorant on this subject. How about instead of throwing a tantrum like an illiterate baby you put that big brain of yours to work and read up on MAPS or PTSD. If you seriously think people suffering from PTSD are not worth helping idk what to tell you other then you're an asshole. Nobody is getting ""high"" off these trials. These are severly I'll people who have tried all the other forms of coping with PTSD and who are trying something as a last resort. Something that has very promising results. Please explain to me why helping people with PTSD is bad in your mind? Read the fucking abstracts of their research. These are not millions of people getting in on this. It's small groups being given small doses. Even if it was some conspiracy to get drugs on the streets the amount of drugs they'd be able to gather would have zero impact on the drug market. Your comments are simply asanine. These people are not given MDMA and sent home. They are under observation while on it. How in the world anyone can confuse that for anything nafarious is beyond me. It's truley sad that you literally give zero fucks about actually educating yourself. You're ego is so large that you actually think you know more about this topic without spending even a second looking in to it then the countless researches who have soent their entire careers researching this.

"This is awesome.

But here is something depressing about this. The drug has already passed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Now it costs 25 million for a chemical that has probably very few physical drawbacks. And when will it be available in other parts of the world.

Think how expensive that is. Imagine if you had PTSD or something like that and you had to wait 10 years for all these trials to pass. People who have been under small-arms fire can't take chemicals which might be mentally dangerous to them?! You can even go skydiving or do extreme sports. I think after a drug has been deemed physically safe, it should be already legal to get it. 

There are probably other psychedelic medicine which might be useful but it will equally long and expensive process to get them through.

It is just ridiculous. There are many snake oil sellers out there but I think we should really think about risk aversion rationally. When it comes to medicine, we don't. Below is a great example of that.

"I heard a TEDx talk about a teenager who witnessed a suicide, which he suffered PTSD from. He told EMDR had a pretty high success rate for PTSD. 

Now I'm not at all against treatment with MDMA as I'm a user of itself, but there is good seeing there are other viable options for people who may not be comfortable with it. 

Here's the link to the TEDx talk, pretty interesting and depressing.

"Before anyone talks shit about this, MDMA was originally produced to be utilized in psychotherapy and showed a TON of promise in treating PTSD and use in couples therapy. 

It wasn't made illegal until it's wide use at raves in the late 80's and early 90's. Also, most ill effects of MDMA are due to it's adulteration with other substances (methamphetamine, bath salts, speed, etc.) which isn't an issue with clinical trials. MDMA on its own, in small doses, is relatively safe.

"I will not go into why a decentralized system is better from a economics point of view (because frankly I am not an expert on that), but instead more the day to day.

One time PayPal was hacked. Not MY PayPal account, but apparently PayPal in general. This hacker managed to send several thousand euro from my account to someone via PayPal. Luckily my bank noticed and called the Police who informed me of all this.

The Police and myself got PayPal to reverse the transaction, but they still charged me with a bullshit fee and froze my account. A FEE for getting money stolen because THEY fucked up their security.

They off course never opened my account again. I am now excluded from using PayPal again. I wouldn't want to anyways. 

They ban a lot of people actually. If you search for it you can find countless stories about how PayPal just closed the account of businesses or donation accounts because essentially PayPal didn't like the business or the donation cause. PayPal also kept the funds in those cases.

Banks aren't really better in that then PayPal. I got my bank accounts frozen several times because of bullshit reasons. Luckily I was able to get them unfrozen after some days. It sucks to not be able to access your money at all and your only recourse is to talk to the bank to convince them to unfreeze. Which sucks because they are the ones who froze the account in the first place.

That is the beauty of a Centralized Payment System.

With bitcoin this could not happen. Censorship resistant means that your transaction will be treated like any other. No one can Freeze your account. No one can ban you from bitcoin. A huge part of that is the decentralized nature of bitcoin. No one has the necessary control to ban someone. A miner could try to do it, but there are always other miners who will include your transaction.

Decentralization also means that the Bitcoin system itself is better protected against outside forces. Governments or other such actors might try to shut bitcoin down. They could shut down individual nodes or miners, but they couldn't shut the whole thing down because of the decentralization.

You could say that I would not have been able to reverse the transaction on Bitcoin because of the immutability and that is true, but I think that such a situation is much harder to create with bitcoin. I am responsible for the security of my Private Key (and therefor my Bitcoins) not some central place that can be hacked because they don't give a fuck about security. 

This immutability also helps me with securing my Bitcoin, because it is a big part of the ability from anyone to Verify the Bitcoin Blockchain for themselves. I only need the Node software and a copy of the Blockchain and I can verify the validity of any transaction.

You can implement mutability on top of immutability, but not the other way around. I don't see your point.;2;1;False;Tulip-Stefan;dsgklox;Microsoft restores bitcoin payments after ‚Äòworking to ensure lower amounts would be redeemable‚Äô;7paxoq;http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/technology/microsoft-restores-bitcoin-payments-after-working-to-ensure-lower-amounts-would-be-redeemable/news-story/1c875957f470944709497dcfa6ec5fd2
"The most attractive property to most people is that it has a fixed supply, unlike fiat currencies (which are inflationary for the most part). In fact at some point (likely already), Bitcoin becomes *deflationary* since the rate of coin loss, due to loss of the controlling private key, will exceed the rate of issuance. But in the long term, as people get better at safeguarding private keys, we can expect the coin supply to remain relatively constant and have minimal impact on the value of Bitcoin.

What does this mean? Simply holding onto Bitcoin won't cause it to decrease in value as dollars do today, so it can be looked at as a store of value, similar to gold (the supply of which also inflates at a rate slower than fiat currencies). But it also has several advantages over gold: you can send it anywhere in the world in an hour, to anyone, without asking anyone's permission. It is easier and cheaper to store securely. It can't be counterfeited.

Now of course, there remains some debate over whether the store of value use case *on its own* is sufficient, as Bitcoin of course has no intrinsic value to fall back on during an economic crisis -- whereas gold has some basic utility in fashion and electronics, for example. This utility does not contribute to a significant portion of gold's price today, but some believe this utility is necessary in order for anything to serve as a stable store of value. Some others would argue that Bitcoin's utility as a means of exchange and immutable ledger *does* give it intrinsic value -- it is the only way to transfer ownership of something across the globe in a permissionless way, and that ability provides intrinsic value to the system. In a more general sense, it can be seen a globally-accessible database where anyone can store anything and it will remain for all of eternity, regardless of who wants to shut it down. This tech didn't exist before and is tremendously useful across a wide range of industries.

Finally, one of the most hotly-debated topics is Bitcoin's utility as a currency for day-to-day transactions, like buying coffee. Since it was proposed as peer-to-peer electronic *cash*, many want Bitcoin to be usable in all of the same ways cash is today, including point-of-sale purchases. This requires transactions to be cheap (no or negligible fees) and fast (seconds). In the early days, Bitcoin was both of these, today it is neither, and the issue is scaling the system in a way that maintains decentralization. It may be possible that there is no way to scale Bitcoin to thousands of transactions per second while maintaining its current level of decentralization and censorship-resistance; or rather, it may only be able to scale as quickly as advances in computing, which is far slower than the rate at which demand is growing right now. So, other currencies have emerged which trade some amount decentralization for lower fees. Bitcoin has chosen to preserve decentralization at all costs, since that is the property that makes it unique from everything else, and it is one of the few cryptocurrencies which have taken a hard stance on this, which is where a lot of my confidence comes from.

So, why would people be willing to reintroduce counterparty risk? Well, if it turns out people actually do want to spend Bitcoin like cash (in the future once its value stabilizes), the simplest way to support all of the use cases of cash today is to build them as layers *on top of* Bitcoin. An extreme example would be: everything works as it does today, but instead of transacting in USD, you transact in BTC with your credit/debit card, and the settlement networks between banks and creditors use large transactions on the Bitcoin network instead of SWIFT and clearing houses. Everything above the settlement network is identical, and the only property of BTC that is preserved to the consumer's benefit would be its fixed supply. But of course, in reality we'll likely see more disruptive changes in the layers between the Bitcoin network and the user which will allow preservation of other properties; Lightning Network is one such proposal.";5;0;False;farsightxr20;dsgnple;Microsoft restores bitcoin payments after ‚Äòworking to ensure lower amounts would be redeemable‚Äô;7paxoq;http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/technology/microsoft-restores-bitcoin-payments-after-working-to-ensure-lower-amounts-would-be-redeemable/news-story/1c875957f470944709497dcfa6ec5fd2

"Decentralization implies the system can't be shutdown by a single entity (or minority of entities). If you build a decentralized system on top of a centralized platform, then the platform itself can simply be shutdown by its owner or someone who is able to coerce its owner.

"Being decentralized means it's impossible for a power or authority to shut it down.  This grants value because it means you can rely on the system 'always being there'.  This also grants censorship resistance, meaning a power or authority (doesn't have to be a government, could be Comcast) can't prevent you from transacting with someone you wish to.  

Because it's decentralized, you also don't have to worry about the central authority suddenly not existing anymore.  For example, if a company went out of business, suddenly it's stocks are worthless.  Similarly, if a government rapidly devalues their currency for one reason or another (usually severe financial crisis) the general population of that country doesn't suddenly find themselves without the means to purchase food (see Greece, Zimbabwe and Venezuela for recent examples).

And based on [this blog post](https://blog.bitpay.com/microsoft-chooses-bitpay-to-power-bitcoin-payments/), that provider is BitPay.

Now remember that BitPay was going to [stop processing payments under $100](https://blog.bitpay.com/minimum-invoice-update/) in December before [backpedaling two days later](https://blog.bitpay.com/invoice-minimum-change/).

Maybe they started pulling the plug on Bitcoin payments when Bitpay first told them about the new minimum, then were pissed off when Bitpay bailed on that two days after the public announcement.

It's hard to say exactly what happened, but there's a 100% chance it was related to BitPay since Microsoft's reason for re-instating bitcoin is that they ""worked with their provider"" to allow lower bitcoin amounts.";166;4;False;signos_de_admiracion;dsg62fn;Microsoft restores bitcoin payments after ‚Äòworking to ensure lower amounts would be redeemable‚Äô;7paxoq;http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/technology/microsoft-restores-bitcoin-payments-after-working-to-ensure-lower-amounts-would-be-redeemable/news-story/1c875957f470944709497dcfa6ec5fd2

"I am currently still awaiting a payment reversal(that was my fualt!

I would never have purchased this under the bitcoin payment option, today, tomorrow and or in the alternate reality. For one, we would weed out scams and shade like the one I happily contributed to with my mastershitracecard. 

I hope you are truly do not fall for the payment reversal bullshit campaign. 

Learn to spend with people who will send that shit back, many will out of simply being a human... There are many times where someone sent to a wrong address and that person, company, org sent the funds back when they able to. 

This is one of the huge problems with money period. You need a central party to control the aspects of what you  had/have control over. We are adult enough to understand the importance of making sure that when we spend, we are intending to do so. This is part of the lesson, if it means you made the mistake once, I am sure you will learn the lesson(with bitcoin), with masterraceshitcard!

"I don't understand why we constantly look to Bill Gates for advice on frickin everything.  People act like he's some genius businessman.  He was born at the right time with the right neurons.  He was basically handed the PC business on a silver platter by IBM.  He even sent IBM to another company because Microsoft didn't work on OSs, at the time.  Luckily that other company botched the deal and IBM came back to Microsoft.  He did have the foresight to see the PC revolution but all he did was start a business on something he had a passion and talent for.  Everything else was timing and luck.

It's like taking business advice from Mark Cuban who basically sold a worthless company he didn't even start to a clueless Yahoo at the height of the dotcom bubble.

"And this is just the beginning of what is going to be an incredibly cutthroat environment - with this much money at stake you are going to see more manipulation, hacking attempts, slandering, FUD, and insider trading than ever before. 

We are already seeing much of this with Coinbase. Just look at the Bcash debacle and the R.I.P.ple rumors and you see how much money there is to be made. When you are so big and powerful that you can swing the market with a mere rumor of you supporting a coin then what is to stop you from exploiting that? 

Centralized exchanges are making an INSANE amount of money! Look at what Cryptopia just said - they are making $1 million per day running their exchange. 

Now the ecosystem is filled with coins controlled by ""marketing teams"" and ""CEOs"" there is going to be so many ""deals"" being made to the benefit of the few. 

This will cause a crash and regulation will then step in because it is really the wild wild west right now. Once regulation kicks in it's going to be all over for so many people. 

That's why the future is decentralized exchanges and atomic swap platforms like BarterDEX and others. When there is no influence and support is community based and coins are never delisted it becomes a living breathing being and not something to be controlled by one person.

"A comment very telling of how little experience and success Microsoft has in the fintech space, as really all they ever worked with is retail through payment processors and OEM licensing. 

Why anyone gives credence to the perspective of retailers in relation with the crypto space is beyond understanding. Retail in the current financial system is like L10, yet somehow they have the necessary expertize to figure out what should be done with a settlement layer? They wouldn't know what a settlement layer looks like if it was served to them on a plater. Case in point, Bitcoin.

Not to mention the current retail layer works just fine. I'm perfectly happy using a VISA NFC plastic card to buy my groceries. I have no motivation to modify that.

"The problem is that there really isn't anyway to accomplish those two things without giving up the fundamental benefits of Bitcoin.

How do you control payment reversals? There's no good way to handle that in a decentralized manner. Hell, even in centralized situations it's almost always decided in favor of the purchaser and the seller is left out to dry (and sometimes even hit with chargeback fees). There really is no way to do that in a good manor, and I don't think there needs to be. Paper cash works just fine without any way to reverse transactions that are made with it, and if the two parties really don't trust each other then that can be handled at a higher level by an escrow service just like it is today. It shouldn't be integrated into the money directly.

As for the value, there's also no way to wave a magic wand and fix that. Anything that doesn't have it's value controlled carefully by a government will fluctuate as demand changes, look at any precious metal or any stock. Eventually, as liquidity increases and mining payouts decrease, the value of Bitcoin (or it's successor) will stabilize reasonably to a point where you can put your money in it and be reasonably confident it won't disappear overnight because a disgruntled early adopter dumped their life savings.

Who's not allowing it? Who's losing money? If there is a demand in the marketplace, business people will rush in to fill that demand, because there is profit to be made.

Better? How? You said yourself that idiots are allowed to vote. And you have this army of politicians currently accepting bribes and playing favorites in the market.

How is it that ""people are greedy"" but somehow, there are some politicians out there who are not greedy or able to be corrupted?

>Wrong. Bell Labs breakup wants to have a word.

>Do you know what economies of scale are? Nobody is ""forcing"" you to buy their stuff, you have no choice because we allow mega monopolies. This doesn't magically go away if the government does, it just makes it easier for them to get away with it.

You got part of it right. By ""we allow"" means government creates. It actually does completely go away if we get the freedom to choose. Why would you keep buying from a big company if they provided crappy products? In a free market, you simply vote with your wallet. An entrepreneur will gladly fill in the gaps and compete with crappy bloated companies, but the market has to be free- so these companies aren't government-connected corporations.

>Wrong. They buy any competitor that threatens them with a ""better"" product.

And you can simply not shop at this company. Again, if this company isn't serving the market, an entrepreneur will step in and gladly serve that part of the market and take your money. We don't need government's ""help"" to make this happen.

>And because money is king in this world, nobody stops it because they can't and don't want to. The bigger you are, the more money you have, the more efficient at making money you are, and competition is easily squashed or subverted. Hell, in this ""post-regulation"" world, underhanded tactics like corporate espionage and sabotage go unpunished.

""Government regulation"" just means they will help the businesses who bribe them. Regulators are easily corruptible. In a free market, you don't have anyone to bribe. You have to make a good product or service, or you die. This is the only way to truly regulate the market.

>What you are describing doesn't and will never exist.

Why not? Because you'd rather have a corrupt system with bribes and kickbacks?

>Regulation is the only way to make this better

I agree, but not with government regulators who instantly become corrupt by lobbyist (bribe) money. Let the market take care of crappy bloated business by simply not shopping there.

>I don't know who brainwashed you but it sure has worked, Big Money is your enemy with zero empathy or want to make the world better.

Brainwashed? Right. This is what our public schools do, and they are certainly not teaching free market principles! ""Big Money"" can only be stopped by allowing natural competition in the market. More government regulation means pure crony capitalism, and it just gets worse from what we have today.

They will be eliminated as a source of competition. Being bought out, hostile takeover, or otherwise. There are no rules against it and it's profitable to make sure nobody cuts into your market share. Those who do just get swallowed.

>Who's not allowing it? Who's losing money? If there is a demand in the marketplace, business people will rush in to fill that demand, because there is profit to be made.

Those who are on top. You're imagining some kind of equally-segmented circle chart but you really just need real-world examples to see it's just like that game where a small fish eats slightly smaller ones until it's huge. 

Economy of scale comes into play and nobody can compete once that happens. What kind of laws are there right now that are preventing you from competing with Wal-Mart? Even other (smaller) giant chains are getting pushed out.

>What I'm talking about is actually based on people's desire for profit.

Ditto. 

>What do you think lobbying is? What happens when a corporation hires someone to give money to politicians? How are those politicians stopping or slowing down corporations?

Outlaw lobbyists and make all campaign contributions equal. Problem solved, and the public doesn't get swayed by giant budgets.

Your first mistake is you either don't realize or don't care that what's most profitable is almost always bad for humanity. Low wages, higher prices to maximize profit margins, elimination of competition. Just like in the late 1800's when kids went to work and got black lung and business acted with impunity. Deregulation does NOT work.

Your second mistake is assuming people will just be able to ""vote with their wallet"", as if every market is somehow profitable enough for even 2 let alone more competitors selling the same thing. 

Regulations don't hold back innovation. This is a bizarre rhetoric that boils down to ""I don't want to have to pay for the impact my business inflicts on human life"".

an-cap is just some discussion board stuff, it doesn't exist in the real world.  There is no question that there are too many laws now but the anarchy stuff just goes too far in the other direction.  The ideal is somewhere in between over-regulation and anarchy.  It is a difficult problem that can't be solved by some Ayn Rand quote or a meme.;1;0;False;MillyBitcoin;dsg1tdh;"Jamie Dimon: ""I regret""¬Ä¬ô calling bitcoin a fraud";7p6jar;https://www.ft.com/content/e04e359a-e9e9-3f8e-8e2f-3f4373e5efb0
his argument may be goofed but he has a point: anarcho-capitalism is fundamentally self-contradictory.

"~~Nothing~~ What is stopping bitcoin from being used in fractional reserve banking? All that is required for a bank to be using a fractional reserve banking system is to take deposits and make loans. Alice deposits all her currency into the bank. That bank shows her balance as X. Bob takes a loan out in the amount of Y. The bank keeps a small portion of Alice's money, the reserve, in the bank and uses the rest to give out loans to people like Bob.

If you give your private key or transfer your bitcoins to another entity that controls the private keys, then they can easily lend that bitcoin to someone else.

Currently, the thing stopping bitcoin loans is the dramatic price appreciation of bitcoins. It would be terrible to take a loan of 1 bitcoin back in 2012 and have to pay that bitcoin back now.";1;1;False;;dsfvi0m;"Jamie Dimon: ""I regret""¬Ä¬ô calling bitcoin a fraud";7p6jar;https://www.ft.com/content/e04e359a-e9e9-3f8e-8e2f-3f4373e5efb0
