"> every legitimate election watchdog committee on earth, Including the Carter Center, declared Venezuela's elections one of the most sophisticated and democratic election systems out there.

Not what they say now

https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela-020419.html

> “In 2012, I applauded Venezuela’s use of electronic voting machines as exemplary in the world,” said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. “That characterization since has been misused by Nicolas Maduro to suggest a broad validation of Venezuela’s election system as a whole and of subsequent elections that The Carter Center did not observe. In fact, The Carter Center and others routinely have expressed concern about government interference in recent electoral processes. The Carter Center has not observed elections formally in Venezuela since 2004.”

More importantly, he's the guy who out of nowhere, with no process, just declared himself interim president of Venezuela. Of course he's going to do everything he can to disrupt Maduro's government.

Don't forget, or perhaps you weren't aware, that every legitimate election watchdog committee on earth, Including the Carter Center, declared Venezuela's elections one of the most sophisticated and democratic election systems out there. So, be careful when you are backing the word of an individual like Guerdo, who would so cavalierly ignore all that in a crisis in order to further his own gains.

Thankfully, his power move is now dead in the water.

That was the reason he nationalized the oil industry, to use the country's natural resources to develop the country rather than to further enrich the oligarchs.

"Essentially, the situation in Venezuela can outlined like this: Before the election of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela was one of the most inequal countries; there were large slums of people sitting right next to huge mansions of others, and there was really no middle ground between these two classes.

Hugo Chavez was elected as president by devoting his platform to the representation of that slum living under class of people, and that is how he was able to win the election by a strong majority. What follows is characterised by a desperate struggle between opposing corporate interests and government interests.

"Funnily enough many 'third world' countries I have visited would probably keep going and do just fine - or at least, much better than most 'developed' countries.

Pretty much any country that has cities/towns surrounded by fields with fresh local produce and no dependence on supermarkets and factory-produced, centralised food supplies that come from thousands of miles away (ie most of the 'developed' world).

This would basically be a preparatory measure for any place that wished to do better, ensure most of the local produce is kept/consumed locally and that it's sufficient to feed the populace - and export the remainder. This is basically the opposite of what happens now though and the engineered western markets are embarrassing with some of the loops that are jumped through, that have made local farming impossible.

There's also countries that survive presidential coups and other uprisings, which you'd expect to trigger some kind of collapse, but in reality, people just go about their daily lives, the food is still available and most people are perfectly content.

In the west though, you'd know for sure on day 1 because the media would propel everyone into a furious frenzied drama - there would literally be some guy sitting in an office, photoshopping little headline images with #DOOMSDAY, and that would be a dangerous-as-fuck time to be around.

"I'd say a general engineer's mindset would be what was required. The ability to problem solve. It's funny, up until maybe 50 years ago, I'd say most people had a fairly well rounded skillset. You didn't need to have a degree in architecture to build a house, and the architect didn't need to hire a carpenter to build the frame and an electrician to run the wiring.

When my father was 21, he built a 24 foot fiberglass sailboat from scratch. No one taught him how to do it, he just decided he wanted a boat one day. So he sketched out a rough blueprint based on drawing in a book he had read, went out and got the lumber and balsa for the frame and spent every day after he got out of his job working on it. Eventually he bought an old, broken down, 30hp marine diesel engine, rebuilt it and dropped it in. He planed down a ~30 ft mast, built up the cabin and sewed the nylon sails with his late mother's sewing machine. After about 10 years he bought a bigger sailboat, but he kept the one he built and (now in his late 60s) just recently decided to sell the other one and put the one he built back in the water- besides a bees nest or two that had found their way in over the 20 years it had been out of commission in his back yard, and it needing a new engine (as the almost 50 year old one had corroded beyond repair) he got it ready to sail again in a month.

He also welded the trailer from scratch so he could tow it back to the water (he had originally had it brought to his house by someone else).

He also completely rebuilt a house, including putting the corner of the house on jacks single handedly demoing and re-laying a third of the stone foundation.

I was lucky enough to inherit some of those traits- but I lack the patience and attention to detail he has- so while I can look at what materials are available to me and knowing what needs to get done, accomplish most complex tasks without being taught, I tend to produce much rougher solutions- simply practical- while he's able to produce results that look like they came from a mold.

He also built a computer controlled CNC machine in 1988, completely from scratch- including making the control boards and writing the drivers in straight C, on a feeding printer (with no monitor and before there was an internet to reference code from or even higher level C libraries). I recently found the code for it- about 400 pages long with the handwritten marks from debugging it using only a set of LEDs and by observing the behavior of the machine.

Nowadays, most people can't even paint their own house. ";7;0;False;Nycmdthroaway;eickdzh;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png

Continuous economic growth for 70 years straight (excluding WW2 where everyone was getting butt fucked) (yeah they were also booming through the great depression)

Had extremely high calorie average consumption. Actually more than the US in the 1970s

They went from a primarily agricultural society to and an industrial powerhouse, becoming the second to make a nuclear bomb, the first to make a hydrogen bomb, the first animal, man, and woman in space (this is more political but they were incredibly tolerant. They were the first to grant woman's suffrage, and had 4 women on the politburo), the first satellite, and the first probe to orbit the moon. Again, at the time they were doing all of this, they were agriculturally based only 50 years before....

And the biggest point, they fought with the US for 30 years on who was the world's super power. They were either the first or the second (I would argue 1st tbh) biggest world power.

Actually there's NO reward for those that work because they're eventually taxed to death to give money to the people that don't. That's why they eventually leave the working class. There's no advantage whatsoever and then like you said, the country eventually runs out of other people's money to distribute and then implosion.

1) Private banks can just print money out of nothing and charge interest while still printing regardless and causing mass devaluation of labor.

Honestly no idea. I've never played the game, have no desire to. They're all suicide bots, and I don't know what they're doing. The first few learned how to make gold and then taught subsequent generations. Fairly simple machine learning using convolutional networks in a GAN. When one gets banned, the scheduler destroys its container and starts a new one to replace it which creates a new account from a new IP (I have about 24 million residential IPs), runs through the tutorial, and starts farming. I don't know what that farming entails - it looks from my logs like some of them are mining, some are cooking, some are fishing. There is a periodic linear regression that I run over the action sequence of banned bots to try to humanize their behavior, I am not sure how much it helps but I can say with a fair bit of certainty that my system is more sophisticated than whatever they have in place to detect botting.;1;2;False;ex_nihilo;eicyvy3;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png

"I was talking to a cab driver from Africa a couple years ago. I think he was from Ghana, but I can't remember for sure. Anyway, he was saying that the Chinese were buying up thousands of acres of land in Africa. The first thing they'd do is build a razor wire fence and a concrete landing strip. Then they'd start drilling for water (I'd assume they did extensive geological surveys to find areas with viable aquifers.) They'd set up irrigation systems, fly in fertilizers if necessary and start farming- and within a few months they'd be shipping 2 flights a day back to China, have moved in a thousand workers to man the plantation and built up a small, completely isolated city where the farmers lived. They didn't use any local workers- they basically were just buying up all the fertile land in Africa. There's plenty of fertile land there- the problem is the water table is usually too deep for the local people to be able to afford to drill down far enough to be able to get enough water to properly farm it. That and when the locals do actually start farming decently irrigated land, they don't crop rotate and they end up depleting the soil within a few harvests- the Chinese have the manpower, technology and money to take advantage of the land- all they need is cheap land with plenty of sunlight and they can grow year round.

Now according to this guy, they were actively shipping it back- they do already have quite a population to feed, but I also have to assume, based on the scale and the methods he was describing, that they are planning pretty far ahead as well- since mainland China already has plenty of fertile land of it's own and they apparently are buying any land they can get that can be farmed.";5;1;False;Nycmdthroaway;eichktk;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png

"That last source is extremely dodgy, because they go on to criticise all previous election even under Chavez, in contradiction to every major electoral watch dog. So ignoring that last source as it should be rightly ignored, I'll just address your first source.

It doesn't read like a claim of rigged elections, it just reads like the carter center throwing out a clarification statement due to negative publicity they have likely received. Let's break it down:

> In 2012, I applauded Venezuela’s use of electronic voting machines as exemplary in the world

Okay, so what's changed. I Assume they'll explain that in the very next sentence.

> That characterization since has been misused by Nicolas Maduro to suggest a broad validation of Venezuela’s election system as a whole and of subsequent elections that The Carter Center did not observe.

All this is saying is that Maduro used the Carter Center comment as positive publicity. Well, why wouldn't he? It doesn't contradict the first statement.

>  In fact, The Carter Center and others routinely have expressed concern about government interference in recent electoral processes.

That is a substanceless statement that is just PR maneuvering to retroactively cover their ass given that the Maduro government is now in the target of the US government.

> The Carter Center has not observed elections formally in Venezuela since 2004.”

But many other election watch dogs have.

">You'll be trading favors, food, water, and bullets.

And eventually gold.  Everyone laughs at gold but once the immediate crisis is over gold has a lot going for it.  It's hard to counterfeit, it doesn't rust, it can be melted and reshaped over and over, it's physically beautiful, and easy to carry.

You literally couldn't design a better medium for barter.  There is a reason all cultures spontaneously assigned value to gold without a central authority pushing it.  You'd give up your car right now for a big enough piece of gold.  Anyone who claims gold would be useless to barter with has never held a piece of gold in their hands.

That is not actually a bad plan.  If you took away currency from everyone and simply redistributed it slowly, it would increase in value and the prices would decrease as well, but it would be easier to introduce a new currency instead and peg this to the new one at its high inflation rate.

"Blame Trump,....really?

This started under Bush, and continued under Obama. 

Before Hugo Chaves Venezuela had more oil exports than Saudi Arabia. 

Then the Socialist government seized all the oil wells, and refineries, and kicked foreign oil workers, (experts) out of the country.

Oil production quickly dropped to ZERO. Hard to export, or ""embargo"", something that does not exist.

Promises of free stuff drove out all other businesses. Hard to compete with ""free"".

Have a bakery? You are now ordered to work all day to give your bread away for free.

Then you have no money for flour.

Now there is no food. 

The government fixes the problem by printing more money.

Now you see the basic problem with Socialism. It's all about productivity, money is just a place marker that has no value without things to buy.

There is NO US embargo with Venezuela. You want to sell them food? Go ahead, oh they will be paying you with currency worth 1 millionth a Euro.

You want to become a Billionaire? I'll send you a Zimbabwe  $1 billion dollar note. For awhile everyone in Zimbabwe was a billionaire, ...still couldn't afford to buy food.

Presumably because the bank has to obey the law and hence respect international sanctions and because the [president of the Venezuelan national assembly asked them to do so](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/28/uk/venezuela-juan-guaido-maduro-gold-withdrawal-gbr-intl/index.html) in order to prevent Maduro appropriating the gold for himself.

> Guaido said government officials loyal to Maduro were attempting to sell off its foreign gold reserves in the UK and relocate the profits to the central bank of Venezuela,

> ""I am writing to ask you to stop this illegitimate transaction,"" Guaido wrote in letters sent to British Prime Minister Theresa May and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.
