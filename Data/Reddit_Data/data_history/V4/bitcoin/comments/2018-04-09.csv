"Yeah in the documentary the only credible witness in the entire thing was probably the scientist and everyone else was absolutely morally bankrupt and I wouldn't trust to give a truthful statement at all they were literally career criminals and people that would lie cheat steal assault or kill or rape for money. 

I think his connections to that criminal underworld on the on the island initially gave him a feeling of power but it probably backfired for him as the ex gang members he hired and his Entourage were probably feeling empowered themselves and probably got into things outside of what they were hired to do that brought heat on him. 

These were characters that would probably take it upon themselves to take out a perceived enemy of his just to find themselves in higher esteem or as a broader  plan to blackmail or extort him. It would be hard to argue that there weren't several or dozens of people that were targeting him for kidnapping extortion etc etc to the point where the national government itself probably was in on it too. 

They probably heard through the grapevine that this guy is a gringo with a lot of money who is getting too big for his britchrd. Also in the documentary you can see they actually raided this compound found nothing, found the leftover remnants of the lab he had with that researcher and that was it. 

That was probably a blatant Shakedown by the government's most powerful enforcement agency so needless to say half truth, no truth, may be entirely lies, there's probably way more to the story that will never be known but I would say the shadiest thing and the most believable thing was the researchers testimony.

Sought for questioning as a ""person of interest,"" McAfee fled to Guatemala, and after being arrested there on accusations of entering the country illegally, he suffered heath-related issues and ultimately was expelled from Guatemala and sent back to the US, where he has lived since.

>	The murder case of Faull has never been solved.

>	Burstein uncovers allegations about the Faull murder. Most notably, McAfee's caretaker, Cassian Chavarria, claims on camera that McAfee ordered him to wire $5,000 to McKoy with instructions to kill Faull because McAfee thought Faull poisoned his dogs. When Burstein confronts McKoy in the movie with this information, however, he denies it.

And

>	A man named David Middleton, whom subjects in the film say McAfee suspected of breaking into his house in Belize, was beaten to death. Men who claim to have been involved in the beating speak in ""Gringo"" about the incident, saying McAfee hired them.

And

>	Then there's a disturbing recollection by microbiologist Allison Adonizio, who was working for McAfee developing antibiotics derived from jungle plants in Orange Walk. She alleges McAfee drugged her one night and raped her.

"> Which is why deflationary spirals aren't avoided by ""people can just invest in businesses above the rate of deflation"", because people are invested in companies and assets with a wide range of returns, and deflationary spirals start first by incentivizing people to get out of the safest lowest yielding investments/assets into hoarding cash, which simultaneously increases the deflation rate (and so causing a runaway effect where higher and higher % ROIs become less profitable than holding cash), whilst unbalancing the economy by incentivizing high risk high yield ventures at the expense of low risk low yield ventures.

Even the safest investments are going to pay a higher nominal return than the prevailing deflation, though.  The reason some of those won't achieve the higher nominal return is that some of them will fail and pay nothing.  So its not an obvious move to refuse to invest in the safest bets just because the economy is deflationary.  The safest bets are less likely to fail than the riskier bets.  Some people will pull their riskier investments and others their safest ones.

Another element you are not factoring in is that as prices decline, the cost of a company's inputs declines as well, making them more profitable.

These forces work against the spiral.

">If its always possible to invest in companies above the rate of deflation, why would anyone be invested in anything less profitable than that? Why isn't everyone only invested in the companies that have the highest growth rates?

The higher the possible return, the higher the risk of loss, particularly over shorter time periods.

No one can tell for sure which investments will have the higher returns or when they will have them.

So people don't only put their money in the investment's with the highest returns because they are not sure which ones they are, and opinions differ on which will have the greatest payoff.

This is why speakeasies and casinos boomed in the 1930s even though people were going broke in other more stable businesses, because those vice businesses have higher profit margins than things like farming and so still attracted investment whereas investment in stable low margin businesses dried up and forced lots of bankruptcies, exacerbated by the fact that deflation was driving the cost of low margin goods below the cost of production and so it was impossible to make a profit on much marginal farmland.

It's not a sign of a well functioning economy where people are going out of business producing food in a nation with mass malnutrition, yet people are doing well in businesses on selling moonshine and letting people piss money away on blackjack and roulette. This completely disproves the idea that ""deflation would only discourage trivial consumption, people would still spend on necessities"", the opposite happens because necessities have low margins whereas luxury goods and entertainment tend to have higher margins.";1;1;False;suninabox;dx2hyv8;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"> Even the safest investments are going to pay a higher nominal return than the prevailing deflation, though

Why would that be?

If deflation is at 2%, why can't there be a safe investment that makes 1%? Do you think there are no such investments in the economy? Deflation has been as high as 10% on the gold standard (when gold was continually being produced, but hoarded faster than it was produced), you can't imagine a safe investment that pays less than 10%?

>Another element you are not factoring in is that as prices decline, the cost of a company's inputs declines as well, making them more profitable.

You're treating deflation as a one shot thing rather than a continual process over time.

If a farm spends $50,000 on seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, etc, and there's 10% annual deflation, it doesn't matter if those same materials will only cost $45,000 next year, they still need to make $50,000 on that years crop to break even, which they won't be able to if the price of crops drops below the cost of production. Otherwise they would be better off just doing nothing and holding the cash.

A farm itself is an investment. If you own a $1,000,000 farm then 10% deflation is knocking off $100,000 off the value of the farm, meaning even if the farm is profitable it can still be more profitable to sell the farm for cash.

Unless all businesses see instant returns on investment then deflation is degrading the profitability of those investments over time relative to cash. the longer the time between investment and return the worse the effects will be. Cash can only buy more if people selling now get less than they used to, there's no getting around the fact deflation profits holding cash at the expense of people not holding cash.

Deflationary spirals aren't hypothetical, they happened all over the world during the Great Depression, you can crack a history book and find real world examples of everything I've said here.";1;1;False;suninabox;dx379hl;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

"Howdy there sir/madam. I encourage you to not try and time the market by waiting for the ""next stock market crash."" If you're uncomfortable putting all of your cash into the market at one time... maybe put half of it in and then set up a re-occurring automatic buy every week or so. This will help you ""cost average"" even if there is a bit of a slump... 

Currently I'm in Vanguard VTSAX fund which tries to mirror the total *stock* market. I am not claiming this is the ""best"" one by any means... but the expense ratio is currently .04%. I think there are a few others that are slightly less expensive than this.

Also a conservative method of investing is the ""age rule"" which basically means you ""should"" have whatever age you are of your portfolio in bonds. For example if you are 30...70% of your portfolio ""should"" be in stocks and 30% in bonds. There are great bond funds out there as well.

I encourage you to do your own research and make an informed decision. I'm not a financial adviser... just a random guy on the internet. Good luck!

"Time. Nobody can time the market... just time IN the market

Basically my theory of investing (in anything largely traded) is that nobody knows wtf is going on. I'll use the stock market since it's more ""conventional"" and there is more data.

Think of how many really really smart people there are all trying to do the same thing. They are all looking at the same data and trying really really hard to make a good decision on the value of stocks. When you have that many people doing the same thing the outcome is usually going to be pretty close to the same thing... it becomes almost an organism itself.

So if it's all the same... and nobody is theoretically any more informed or better than anyone else... how do I chose? The common denominator is fees. I can't pick which adviser or fund will be better than any other one (because nobody knows wtf)... but I can control the fee that I pay.

This is one of the primary reasons that low cost fee index funds have become the norm for ""smart"" investing.

Crypto there isn't that much in terms of fees (unless you're day trading)... so just time in the market really. 

I'm not an financial adviser but this is the theory that makes sense to me... and I try to follow it.";4;1;False;nordicminy;dx3b3pe;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto. All your TA means nothing;8b0v18;https://i.redd.it/26bocgtchxq01.jpg

"Okay, so apparently I need to expand in more words, because what you're saying here runs directly counter to the post you ""This!""d to.

1. If it were obvious to any non-idiot that prices were imminently going to decline or crash, then there are more than enough non-idiot market participants who could go ahead and turn a tidy profit by correcting that error, and in so doing they would have already caused the price reduction to happen. Asserting that such a thing is ""obvious"" is to assume that you know better than the collective pricing information and analysis of the rest of the market.

2. While you're waiting for that ""Oh so obvious, any day now, any idiot could see it"" crash, the market will continue to market. Maybe the crash you're predicting arrives, but it comes several years from now; maybe late enough that even at its bottom you still would have been better off by buying sooner. And ""even at its bottom"" is itself optimistic because it implies being able to *recognise* the bottom of the market in the middle of a crash - more likely than not you either spring too early and the crash continues around you, or you wait too long thinking the recovery is just a little bounce.

3. This is not an argument that only applies to day-trading or multiple entries / exits. The maxim of ""time in the market not timing the market"" doesn't differentiate between trying to pick a time for a single trade vs multiple trades. It's all market-timing.

If you think you have better information, better analysis, better instincts, better timing, or better luck (enough of them in combination to beat the market) then go on ahead and make your speculation. I don't know, maybe you're right and there really is money just sat there on the table for the taking, that everyone else was just too idiotic to see.
