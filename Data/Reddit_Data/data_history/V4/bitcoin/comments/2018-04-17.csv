"Can I just go on a brief rant right now? 

This is why people have no idea what companies are doing with their data, or how they are being tracked. I'm sure some larger companies may spell it out in the thick textbooks that are their ToS, but most dont and nobody has time to read them anyway. These permission requests need to be broken down into much further detail. I have no problem with giving permission to allow sceenshots to be saved to my device, but allowing complete access to my photos and media seems sketchy. It is too vague, and provides too much access to the developer who I am just trusting to not misuse those privileges. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you are a trustworthy dev, but I just don't see why something as innocent as saving a screenshot needs to have so much access to my personal information. Hell, at least split the permission request into read and write privileges. These permission requests are the best way for the user to understand what information is being used and how it is being used. Therefor, the requests need to be more exclusive, and they need to include a ""more info"" button that at least takes you to dev notes. It can't be too hard to implement and it will make so much of a difference. 

I have never written an app where I needed permissions, so I dont fully understand how permission requests are handled. I just think there are a lot of people freaking out right now with the Facebook news, and for good reason. Most are simply uninformed, but even those who try to be informed cannot be. Everything is too hidden, and it is usually by design. Permission requests are directly in front of the user when they are installing, usually in a bulleted style for quick and to the point delivery, but they are always too vague. The user has no idea what information is being used or how unless the dev is nice enough to share his secrets, which we are then just supposed to take their word for it. Fixing these requests is the first and biggest step to improving data privacy and security.

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. ";26;2;False;thudrs;dxhoj8r;Crypto Rider - A free game I made about racing on Bitcoin and other crypto's historical price graphs! (more info in comments);8cpgxx;https://i.redd.it/jwhypb5p5bs01.gif
Hey, this happens on iOS but not on Android. I am not sure if you can decide when it is shown on Android. I'll certainly have a look into it. To be honest I may just get rid of the screenshot saving feature, as the majority of people probs dont save screenshots. And I dont want people getting worried when the permissions box appears.;4;0;False;TipToeTiger;dxhvqyw;Crypto Rider - A free game I made about racing on Bitcoin and other crypto's historical price graphs!

Hi, yeah I totally get what you're saying. I think I am actually going to remove the screenshot saving function in a future update. As I bet the majority of people who actually share/save screenshots is very low. It's the first time I have actually tried to make a save feature and to implement it was quite easy. Android requires you to add the permission request inside the code otherwise the game crashes when the user tries to save the screenshot. I think the wording that Android use to ask the user for permission is very lacking in detail as you said. Hopefully it is something they can fix for the future. But I hear you man! I don't think anyone wants someone to have access to their personal stuff, it is certainly the hot topic right now and rightly so.;12;1;False;TipToeTiger;dxhvwf7;Crypto Rider - A free game I made about racing on Bitcoin and other crypto's historical price graphs!

"Hey, I was thinking, the game is great, but the little countdown to start is a little annoying. Maybe have it like geometry dash so you instantly restart at the beginning, or you can choose to have a small menu when you crash that you can activate in settings. I was also thinking that maybe the different crypo coin vehicles would have different looks, like a motor bike etc. at last, if they were upgradable in speed and control. These are my suggestions, but the game is great where it already is. Thanks!

"Here is some honest constructive criticism.


1The one thing that has been bothering me, is that you can’t flip the other direction.if you over flip, you lose.

2 This is quite minor, but if you are holding down on the screen on when you are on the ground and then you launch of an unexpected jump, then you start to turn and ,as I said in the last one, can ruin your game. If all of this is intentional, and for difficulty, then never mind, it is still a great game.

3  This is minor, but there should be a difficulty indicator on the tracks. One star = easy, three stars  hard.

4 Maybe you should add a slight difference between the cars, idk.

This is a great game nonetheless.";6;0;False;Llama_g0d;dxhkfz8;Crypto Rider - A free game I made about racing on Bitcoin and other crypto's historical price graphs! (more info in comments);8cpgxx;https://i.redd.it/jwhypb5p5bs01.gif

"Just played and I think the concept is great! But as a Trials player I’m finding it hard without being able to “lean forward”. I think the game would be more fun with a accelerator button with the ability to adjust lean forwards and backwards. Perhaps have a look at Trials Frontier for an idea of what I mean.

"A small note: on android, without Google play services (aka the Google spyware) it pops open a warning dialog twice, then hangs.

I can imagine you depend on some Google libraries (though it would be good to have more apps without it) because of push notifications, firebase or some other Google backend. But in that case, either close the app, crash it, or continue with limited features. Play services lib/wrapper has APIs for this.

Yes, my phone is completely Google-free. And yes, I am aware that I am that annoying 1% user who is far too loud about it. But I thought you might want to know and learn.
