So many athletes and lottery winners are now poor. Why? They spent like they were rich and became poor.


People who break six figures and buy a new luxury car and an overpriced condo would quickly be in the poor house if they lost the six figure job.


Whereas the person who buys a cheap car and a reasonably priced mediocre home and invests the rest will be wealthy even if they lose the six figure job (depending on how fast)

"It's almost the polar opposite of gold.

Gold does not corrode or physically degrade. If you're holding a gold coin, you'll still be holding a gold coin when the world is burning. You lose your access to bitcoin as soon as you lose your internet connection.

The laws of physics place a limitation on how much gold is around in the universe. Bitcoin might be limited by its business rules but that doesn't mean much if it keeps forking or when someone else comes up with a better alternative with more mainstream appeal.

Gold is a stable store of value because it's inverse relationship to the economy. If the economy is booming, you get much more return on investments in the economy and the gold price predictable flattens out or sinks a little. If the economy is volatile, that same stability is attractive and gold prices predictably rise a bit.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, can fluctuate in massive percentages based on nothing more than negative or positive media attention. It's the opposite of a good hedge against turmoil because it's value twitches like a paranoid delusional's self esteem.

Ultimately that means that gold is a good hedge alongside other investments. It won't make you much money in the long run but it won't lose you much money either.

Bitcoin is barely an investment. It's more of a big gamble. If you ride the wave you can earn a lot of money and if you're unlucky, the whole thing will burn down around you.";20;6;False;TheSecretMe;doizahc;Trying to play it cool with my life savings in Bitcoin;772kkf;https://i.redd.it/anre9v8z5hsz.jpg

It seems like a lot, but the value of all gold in the world is at 8.2T, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see Bitcoin’s eventual value approach that.

I really wonder if people understand what we r dealing with here. Bitcoin provides things that have never been available in the history of mankind. It provides the freedom to trade without permission of any kind. No government allows you to do this. This is true freedom. It provides mathematically sound money that can’t be cheated. Sure there will be scams and theft, but the system as a whole can’t be rigged in the way it is now and forks don’t matter. The market chooses just like it chooses everything else even if there are many other alternatives available. It provides a secure store of value that can’t just be seized or taken from the owner. You can hold it without anyone knowing or having to pay to protect it like with gold or money in a bank. People put high valuations on Apple because they sell electronics or google because they deal in information but I promise u that nothing is more valuable to people than secure money. Even if bitcoin is just a precursor to another coin, don’t underestimate its impact.

Basically, anyone who collects a paycheck (including millionaires) is middle class. Earning six digits makes you no where near “rich”. Yes, you’ll be able to buy lots of hookers and coke and you’ll be better off than most...but let’s not kid ourselves

If that paycheck stops coming, you’ll lose your lifestyle.

"No, the same strategy does not work for Enron or Goldman Sachs, because part of it is to not convert back into fiat for the sole purpose of holding fiat -- ever.

Don't try to time the market. Buy small amounts in regular intervals. Then hold. I mean, sure you can go and try to call the tops and bottoms. Maybe you increase your USD holdings with it short term. But it's not an efficient way to significantly increase your net worth long term.

Diversification is a great general rule of thumb. But this is a very rare opportunity one should recognize and seize.

I don't know why survivorship bias should apply here. No hodler has really ""died"". The only bitcoin owners that lost value (in theory) have been owning bitcoin for a maximum of five days. Everyone else who bought and didn't sell is *far* better off. This is what I'm advocating. Buy and hold.

While it makes sense to cover your ass when suggesting crypto to friends and family, the truth is, bitcoin has an insanely good risk/reward ratio. This is ""once in a lifetime"" level stuff.

Some people see more clearly where this thing is headed. If those people invest more than you would deem appropriate, they're not necessarily crazy. To the contrary.

"There are a number of ways to discuss valuation. First, let's assume a best case - world currency adoption. We have 21 million BTC spread among 7 billion people. The average wealth per adult in the world is $52,800 according to Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Report 2016. So if we multiple $52,800 by 7 billion - we get a total of 369 trillion in total wealth. Divide that over the max of 21 million bitcoins, we see that $52,800 is equivalent to  0.0000001 BTC.

Even if we are off by a factor of a million, that brings $52,800 being equal to .0568 BTC (or $929,577 dollars per BTC).

Push that to a factor of a trillion, then $52,800 is worth 56.82 BTC - or $929 per BTC (which we are already past). 

All that said, what is worst case? All the major governments of the world outlaw crypto today and they all go to a fraction of their current value.

I imagine the reality will lie somewhere between the best and worst case - but with that said, we have at least a few orders of magnitude up in valuation we can go pretty easily.";2;0;False;cosmicv;dojrr2v;Trying to play it cool with my life savings in Bitcoin;772kkf;https://i.redd.it/anre9v8z5hsz.jpg

"No, I don't agree. I don't think you know what frugal means or how rich people work. This is from wikipedia:

> In the context of some belief systems, frugality is a philosophy in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) ""expert"" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.

You're talking about being a good business person, not about being frugal. A frugal person is someone who spends little money and avoids any expensive social things. You talked about a dude owning 6 houses being frugal. LOL. The definition is simple. You can't throw around tons of cash and call yourself frugal because you made good investments. Should I call a millionaire art collector who clips coupons frugal? Fuck no, they just had the money to buy a guaranteed asset, and the other stuff they do is just idiotic behavior they picked up somewhere that has nothing to do with their wealth.

The whole ""driving an old truck"" thing is such bullshit anyway. Cost of car ownership is well known, and the cost of maintaining a late model sedan is cheaper than that old truck. Getting a Chevy Spark base model will be more cost effective than that old Ford truck. I've known people who brag about their cheap Toyota trucks....and I've seen them drop $2k-$3k on repairs every couple of years on something whether it's transmission, engine, or suspension work. Get a new Chevy Spark, drive it for 20 years, then send it to the junk pile. No reason to keep maintaining old cars, they just wear out eventually.

Rich people get rich by being good at business and investing. If you've ever known CEOs, they are extremely charismatic and they are obsessed with making money and making clients happy. Of course following budgets is important, but a good business person will spend gigantic sums of money if it makes sense to do so. This is highly opposed to being frugal. Some people have recently tried to change the term frugal to simply mean ""cost effective"", but that's in no way what being frugal means. Nobody in the business world talks about being frugal.

I've only seen this reversal online where people basically say the most rich people are the most frugal. I'm like, are you kidding?

"ICO, Bitcoin, Ethereum need people who understand Economics & Business Management. I am a CPA, and own a small practice. The liability of work makes it no longer attactive, and the free crypto meetings have become more profitable through shared knowledge.

My most optimal move is to hire an office manager, convert to C-Corp (to sell shares, or maybe LLC), get 2 part-timers, begin Crypto study sessions as an after school item, continue with meetings but spread them to residentials leveraging current attendees, & continue whoring myself for tokens on blockchain. This will create huge societal wealth with huge networking advantages, with a developing talent pool which will require management and coordination.

I am also running for Mayor against the Wrestler Kane.

"What? Everything is results-oriented. That's the whole point. If, in 200 years, cryptocurrency investments prove to be more stable than the S&P 500, what then? (Not saying this is remotely viable, but I'm proving a point). They become the ""smart"" investment.

Whether or not an investment is ""wise and calculated"" depends entirely on its outcome and your risk tolerance, especially with the markets as random and volatile as they are. The only thing that's changing in your view is the timeline. While any expertise in the financial sector could be considered a gambler's fallacy, betting on companies that you think will continue to succeed (Facebook, Google, Walmart) are GOOD bets, just like betting on a technology that you think will succeed is a good bet.

"The more effefctive way of doing a state sponsored attack on the Bitcoin network, would be if current hashing power was taken over. China really is the only nation that could feasibly do this now, by seizing all the large-scale mining operation and production facilities. And I’m not sure it’ll be that for long.

It would still be a huge operation and it would always be a PoW change away from being neutered completely but at least the investment and roll-out time is smaller and risk of the ASIC miners produced ending up supporting the network (which is otherwise very real) is avoided.

It would halt the network and trust would be lost in transacting on it but peoples balances would be fine and it would by no means destroy Bitcoin. Frankly, I think there's a case to be made for it strengthening it longer term due to the attention it would bring and the added feather to the cap this newly proven resilience would provide.

While a 51% attack certainly is not a joke, people *way* overestimate the destructive effect it could have.

"That is your opinion, which is fine. You named the stock with the largest market cap in the entire S&P 500... so maybe your current method for research is likely misguided. I think it’s really hard to generalize the entire stock market based off Apple. Stocks with good valuations don’t have to be laggards, likely they are just less researched by professional analysts. If all stocks were fully and correctly priced, I wouldn’t be able to continue arbitraging assets that are less researched (which can be a day, a week, or a month before a correction in price is made). Try small cap or mid cap stocks, which are usually less researched across the board. 

Because I think it’s a net good to help the public understand markets, I suggest you use ratios and figures in tandem for screening criteria, such as P/E, PEG, Market to Book, Dividend Yield, Current ratios, and positive operating cashflows. Using these together can help you determine a good valuation, but knowing what values are “good” may require some knowledge of finance and is up for you to decide.

"Originally I was charging $20, which I collected twice. However, ‘assets under management’ has grown from a half mil to $4 Mil in about 3 months. Two ICOs are forming, and last meeting I just listened while others made presentations. One speculator has made ~8 recommendations for over 50% To 300% gains. Far more than ‘hodl’ but something impossible for us to do solo. Another invests only but splits profit.

Growing the asset pool & splitting research activity has increased the wealth faster than the $20 fee. We now got a China man attending for NEO & Walton Research. Last meeting, he was explaining to us how old Chinese emperors us to value poetry above all. And so parents encouraged their children to be poets instead of mathematicians, and this lead to a weakening of the economy & a lot of starvation. And added, ‘like American parents do now with that ‘be whatever you want’ right?’

But Z, current shadow emperor, has been growing industry and their population is doing good. He asserted that Chinese are very nationalistic, which is as I suspected. So rather than ban crypto, most likely is that he’d make a state coin. He said in China you are allowed to say whatever you want, so long as you don’t criticize the government or Z. He said elections are in name only.

This amount of research would have taken weeks, but we get it for milk & cookies, & for sharing our own. Worth far more than any amount of $20 fees, which would have prevented him from coming. We got another guy setting up mining rigs, etc. specialization which is not possible solo.

Just realize that in 20 years or so, crypto will be so mature after the emission slows, services get developed speculation stalls. The blockchains will be up and running.

The recent price action of Bitcoin is nearly identical to the price action of many penny stock pumps. Note that I'm not calling Bitcoin a pump or fraudulent; I would like nothing more than for it to succeed. But you can't ignore price action, and usually such price action is followed by a sharp or long decline. Financially, there's no reason why Bitcoin's price action would behave differently from existing types of assets.

">It provides the freedom to trade without permission of any kind.

Just like any other kind of trading that's not fiat. Or fiat for that matter. Plenty of shady cash trades going around.

>It provides mathematically sound money that can’t be cheated

For now. The bigger bitcoin get's, the most interesting it becomes to make a major effort at cracking or derailing it. There are zero guarantees it's future proof.

>It provides a secure store of value

No, it doesn't. One of the primary qualities of a store of value is that is has a predictable value once you retrieve it. Bitcoin does not. Over the last few weeks bitcoin fluctuated by some 25+%. That's not predictable at all.

>It provides a secure store of value that can’t just be seized or taken from the owner.

Like those silk road bitcoin?

>You can hold it without anyone knowing

In a public ledger where every transaction can be traced

> I promise u that nothing is more valuable to people than secure money

I suppose that explains why bitcoin is struggling to actually gain any traction as a mainstream currency

"Money has 3 different characteristics required:

1. Has to be a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin cannot be used to buy many many things, so it doesnt fufill this criteria

2. It has to used as a unit of account: i.e. Prices are described in bitcoin. This is very rare and is not widely used as a unit of account

3. Store of value i.e. Money holds purchasing power over time. This is a characteristic of bitcoin. However, since the value if bitcoin rises instead of decreases, it means it isn't valuable to buy something with it. So since it is an investment, people will not use it as currency. 

This is why small inflation is a good thing. It pushes people to spend instead of save. This is why deflation is a bad thing. 

So no, Bitcoin is not a currency. ";1;0;False;The_Cheezman;dojhe3d;Trying to play it cool with my life savings in Bitcoin;772kkf;https://i.redd.it/anre9v8z5hsz.jpg

"Please take your money out. What you're doing is madness. I have met a lot of gamblers who have taken your attitude that they can kill themselves if it doesnt work out because they're already depressed. This is an unbelievably common attitude. It rarely ends well. Chances are you wont, you'll just be miserable and possibly turn to drugs.

But your equation makes no sense. Bitcoin has just rocketed up 25x in 2 years. It is valued at 100 billion dollars, whilst in the midst of hard forks, stuck transactions, mutliple regulatory risks, and a failed ETF. Sure, we might go to 25k in this run. But we might do exactly what we did after the last 2 bull runs, and drop 90% in a short period of time. And this time, maybe enough people get burned that it's outlawed in most countries. 

So your best case equation for the near term is 5x your money, worst case 10% of your money. 

Your financial goals are to have 5 million dollars, to live your life as you wish. That's $200k a year with the 4% rule, plus a 5 million dollar retirement blowout. If you cant be happy with that, you never will, so it's a good goal. 

Now you say you already have 1 million. 

Lets try a different investment strategy. 

lets put 500k into a mixture of historically strong market trackers, aimed at the sectors you like most. You may have to endure a market crash, like in 2008, but so long as you dont sell, the economy will always recover(failing armegedon, in which case this is all meaningless, anyway), so we can assume a 6 -10% yearly return on this, depending on risk, and a bit of luck.

lets take the other 500k and split it into 3 chunks of 166k

Put the first chunk into a local property you can manage. Use what should be a clear 6-8% income from rent, if you manage it, as your passive income. That's 10k+ a year income before you lift a finger. And the property will act as a savings account which should beat inflation.

lets take a 166k and put it into your passion. a business or idea you've always wanted to pursue which could pay off big time. Or maybe someone elses passion. you must have ideas for high risk/high reward local businesses that you could try your hand at. Aim for a high book value proposition, where you buy equipment or property which act as a store of the capital, rather than something which speculatively consumes your money.

the other 166k. put it into bitcoin. Hell, do some research, and hit a couple other cryptos if you want. look for high return. but put the bulk in bitcoin. 

Lets establish a time frame. Lets say 8 years. You'll be 43, still very young, and fit enough to live as you please. Also, as you admit, bitcoin might take 5 years to see the gains you wish, anyway. 

Now lets do the math. On your 500k, you're making, lets say 8% a year. That's not impossible on that quantity of money, with some diligence.  After 8 years of reinvesting the interest, that's almost $100000.

Your flat? Well, if you dont spend the income from rent, and assuming a historical value growth, it amounts to almost $350k

Your business? Well, who knows. Maybe it tanks, maybe you only make back your asset sales. But maybe it does a bitcoin. Maybe you get lucky. Lets say you do. lets say you make 3x your investment. Thats almost 500k

Now, the bitcoin. Well, lets assume you're right, and it goes up 10x from here. Thats $1.6 million.

All together now... You've turned your 1 million into $3.4 million. But, the important bit, you've exposed yourself to a fraction of the risk. 

In one scenario, yous stand to gain 9 million, but lose 900k. In the second, you stand to gain only 3.4 million, but you can only really lose 300k(bitcoin, and business venture) The other assets, although the may have ups and downs, have such intrinsic value, it would take an economic apocalypse to end them. You cant lose so long as you dont sell them. 

So, if your goal is to actually have 5 million one day, and live the life you want, the fastest way there is to follow the second plan. The fastest way to guarantee youll never have it, and be forced to actually deal with suicide, is to gamble on bitcoin. I say that as a believer in bitcoin. but it does have risks which could drive the price to zero. That's what makes it such a harsh gamble. 

You are just 8 years away from being worth 3.4 million, if bitcoin meets your expectations. With that 3.4 million, you could pull in an eternal income of over 100k, while beating inflation on your underlying. Compound that for just another 8 years and you would be vanishingly close to 5 million. And at no point did you risk ruination.

"No way it goes to zero.  No way anyone loses everything.  Zero percent probability.

I mean, of course you want to keep a little money in the old system, but don't expect much from it.  I expect my Roth to pay for a couple of nice vacations or a new car when I'm old enough to collect my money, but it will be a very small part of my portfolio in a couple of years, an afterthought. 

A hypothetical person with a million-dollar portfolio could have $100,000 in bitcoins (that they bought for $25,000 less than a year ago) and the rest in stocks and bonds.  Contribute the max to their IRA.  Not buy another coin.  And in two years, they'll have $835,000 in stocks and bonds, and $2+ million in Bitcoin if they hodl.  Or stocks and bonds may tank (more likely), and the Bitcoin will still have appreciated.

"That does tend to be true, but that usually isn't what made them rich. When Elon Musk first decided to be an entrepreneur and said he figured he could live off of $30/month eating Ramen-type food every meal. He didn't get rich by saving the extra money, he got rich by leveraging everything he had into his ideas. Paypal payout of $150M - all went back into SolarCity/Tesla/SpaceX. His net worth keeps compounding - but it has nothing to do with the $7/day he saved eating Ramen.

Very, very few people really get rich from the salary of their job, leaving investments and frugality aside.

The 'ultrawealthy' often get to that point by taking on 5-10x their net worth in debt for some venture or investment with the goal of multiplying the investment many times over. 

i.e. You have $200,000 in liquid assets that you use to make a down payment on a $800k-$1M loan. You then use the loaned money to buy assets which can produce long-term cash flow in excess of the interest payments. So then after 10-15 years, you have millions of dollars in assets plus the consistent cash flow. All built from that initial $200,000 that you successfully leveraged. 

It is risky and that's why most people don't ever even think about trying something despite the life-changing potential.";1;0;False;ThomJeffers;dok1zgp;Trying to play it cool with my life savings in Bitcoin;772kkf;https://i.redd.it/anre9v8z5hsz.jpg

This is how i see bitcoin. If you understand that it is a boom bust high volatility game you win. If you understand that every 4 years it will halve and its value will increase and statablizes you win. You lose if you walk away or hold indefinitely.  Its a investment vehicle that allows a small investment to reward holding it. If you after 5 years of holding it arent diversified into the same amount of fixed income assets or property that will provide you with passive income to live day to day or ivest elsewhere you miss the point. Buy in and sell high and never sell low. Sell into other cryptos that you will hold hoping 1 out of 10 or out of 100 will make you money.  As we get older it is harder to recover when the market goesdown.  Investing wisely is key to mental health.

"$100x100=$10,000... sorry, I’m a numbers kind of guy.

$100-$2000 seems reasonable based on the growing size of the small BTC economy. Over $5000 seems a little ridiculous for outdated crypto technology that has problems scaling to large amounts of transactions. Also from several conversations with BTC buyers, it screams bubble imo... which is why I exited the market at $4800. Also several industry surveys for investors have come out saying the consensus opinion is that BTC is a crowded market, if not the most crowded.

I’m an Investment Analyst that functions as an asset manager at an investment bank (my peers and I manage a smaller portion of  investable funds while my boss (a senior VP) manages the big money). As a Libertarian, BTC seemed appealing, so I flirted with BTC for a short-time as an investment opportunity and thought of pitches for BTC at work... but my research pointed to a speculative bubble that could go higher or collapse at any moment... so instead I gave a presentation on why our assets should not be allocated to BTC, and possibly exploring other options in the crypto market. My boss and I made a bet for fun, guessing when the bubble would collapse, my guess was by the end of 2017. His guess was sometime in 2018, since he thinks the US government will eventually crush BTC, but the US federal agencies tend to be slow to regulate some markets, especially with the current administration.

In my opinion, a crypto backed by the full power of a developed government or real assets of an organization. I don’t think BTC is the future, but other cryptos have the potential to be.

I’d recommend 100% Bitcoin, until you have $200,000 in. After $200,000, I’d recommend beginning to Diversify (Mutual Funds).

If you have less than $20,000, it is more profitable to focus on improving your current income & ability to save. I spent $1,500 making giant signs promoting Bitcoin Meetings for ‘free’ & I am beginning to see huge returns, along with my transition from Accounting to Crypto- Accounting.

"Personally I'm tired of having bitcoin regret. I had it years ago when it was worth a few bucks and I looked back and it used to be *pennies*. Then I had regret when bitcoin broke 15 and I looked back to when it was worth only a dollar or two. Then I had regret with bitcoin hit $500 fucking dollars, god I'd be a millionaire. Then it hit $1000 and I nearly cried. Then when I heard of Ehtereum I decided I didn't want the same to happen with it, so I started buying it. Bitcoin was about $2000 at the time and I was sure it had done all the climbing it would do, no way I'd see significant returns any time soon. 3 months later it was $4500.

">A bank account is just a set of numbers in a computer made up by the bank, the net of the transactions between these virtual accounts is what settlement does, typically on a daily basis. DAILY not 10 mins.

I'm talking about confirming transactions between bank accounts and retailers, which happens in seconds. The money doesn't need to move instantly but the transaction needs to be confirmed instantly for these businesses to work.

Peer to Peer blockchains cannot confirm transactions this fast by nature of the technology, which is why people are relying on VISA cards that sell bitcoins and transfer dollars rather than sending bitcoins directly.

You're not talking about using bitcoin as a peer to peer blockchain currency if its primary use will be through a centralized banking system which doesn't transfer bitcoin on the blockchain but simply transfers a proxy unit in an external system.

Firstly that means your reliant on a banking system with direct centralized government control of the medium of exchange, which invalidates the whole notion that Bitcoin avoids reliance on centralized government currency.

Secondly, that proxy unit would become the de facto currency since no one would actually need to exchange it for bitcoin so long as they could exchange it with banks and businesses, just like no one needed to exchange gold-standard dollars for gold so long as people were accepting dollars. Meaning you've just replicated gold-standard dollars except it will be bitcoin-standard dollars. Except no bank or customer will want to do that because they don't want to be limited by a pegged currency because customers want to borrow money and banks want to lend it. So they would just keep using fiat currency because it allows you to borrow and lend more money than there are bitcoins available. And no one wants debt in bitcoin since it increases in value over time.

> Do you understand how banks work? You think they pass money around in real time??

They can confirm transactions almost instantly. High frequency trading occurs on a scale of nanoseconds. There will never be nanosecond bitcoin transactions.

>Re- stability ah so you are arguing bitcoin is better off in a 2 year bear market because that was more stable??

A greater percentage of people with bitcoin were actually using it instead of just speculating on it.

>I agree stability will come with actually usage, it will also come with speculation simply because the market cap

Speculation prevents people from using the currency because it keeps inflating the price.
