Coinye, formerly Coinye West, is an abandoned scrypt-based cryptocurrency that became embroiled in a trademark infringement lawsuit for using the likeness of American hip hop artist Kanye West as its mascot, despite West having no affiliation with the project. The project was abandoned by the original developers following West's filing of a trademark infringement lawsuit against them.

I don't disagree with the network penetration point.

As for the valuation of bitcoin, I personally think there’s numerous ways to look at it, in fact numerous ways you need to look at it. just like with stocks. There’s fundamental & technical ways of valuating stocks. There’s endless variations from each perspective as well, and endless combinations of both. There’s no single answer to ""what is a bitcoin worth"". That's why there's so much volatility. In the end we'll see it's the balancing of numerous different ways of valuating it.

"You're missing the point. Unchecked growth isn't necessarily a positive for a value storage either.

The whole point of finding a way to store value is to keep it as stable and predictable as possible. Ideally having its value tied to or backed by very stable and predictable factors.

The reason people love gold as a store of value, for instance, is that it's a known quality that is very likely to not change in radical ways. Ie.

* gold does not rot
* gold does not corrode
* gold cannot be produced in any meaningful quantities and certainly not cost effective
* the laws of physics place a limit on the amount of gold available, found and unfound

At the same time, the value of gold has an inverse relationship to the economy. If the economy is doing great, the gold price sinks slightly. If the economy is doing poorly, the price of gold goes up a bit. Very predictable changes.

I'm not making an argument for gold over bitcoin but that is what makes a good store of value. Predictability and stability. Bitcoin has neither.

At the end of the day, bitcoin is not a store of value. It's not a functional currency. It's not an investment. It's not a money transfer system with low fees anymore. It's a gamble that can pay off.

And the only problem I have with that is that I never got into bitcoin because I wanted a profitable gamble. I wanted a currency or a money transfer system and it stopped being that.";2;1;False;TheSecretMe;ds9of8u;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg

when you buy a stock of a company, you are buying a percentage of the business, so when that business makes money, you make money. sometimes that business will pay out the money it makes out to its investors. in that case you would receive money. this is called a dividend. what usually happens is that the business buys more equipment with the money it makes, or opens new locations. in this case, the price of the stock goes up because the percentage of the business you bought is worth more. a price goes down when a business looses money and they have to sell things to stay in business. which means the percentage of the business you bought is now worth less than when you bought it. you should only buy a stock based off of value, not of price. not of how fast the ticker is going up, not based off of what other people say. you need to read the financial statements, and get a good idea of what the business is worth. if its a good price then pay it. too many people don't know what they are doing and they create huge spikes and crashes in the economy and that all can be summed up with simple behavioral economics. they buy when they are greedy and they sell when they are scared. don't pay attention to them. 

so basically you should use your cryptocurrency to buy stocks, and then take payments in crypto. if they don't offer dividend payments in crypto, then accept USD and convert to BTC. 

once again. cryptocurrencies are not investments, they are medium of exchanges. if you want stable growth you should exchange your medium for a percentage of a business you think will be profitable years form now. 

the easiest way to loose all of your money is to throw it around without knowing why you are throwing it around. so read up on what you are investing in beyond ""its the future"" everyone knows its the future, which is why everyone is paying exurbanite amounts for it. which is why there isn't any profit in it. 

if it was easy, everyone would do it. and when everyone does it, they compete the profit away. there is no simple coin you can buy that will make you money 50 years from now. you have to actually do research yourself to find out what is the best investment, because if there was a simple buy, everyone would and there wouldn't be any money in it anymore.";2;0;False;;ds91bay;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg

You need death. Because..you need life  after death. You need a legacy. You need something to show that you remain, and the quality of your remains is what will dictate “how long” after death you get to live. Actual immortality makes life meaningless. “Oh..I only have an infinite number of years to accomplish it, so I’ll just chill for now.”
When “life” was first designed, the first line of code was to include “death”. It is the most fundamental part of life. That you are finite. That you will disappear, and the only thing that will remain is your “legacy”, however you define it.

"Gold is naturally scarce, cryptos aren't.

If someone could write a line of computer code that made infinite gold available then gold would become worthless overnight. It so happens it takes nuclear fusion to make new gold so its not likely to happen any time soon.

There's huge demand for gold jewelry all around the world. The majority of gold demand comes from jewelry and gold jewelry is a 6,000 year old human tradition with no sign of going away.

You're banking on a fixed supply somehow having an unbeatable competitive advantage, which there's no reason it would have because it just makes it unusable as a currency (although it makes it an attractive speculative asset in the short term).

For a currency to be usable supply needs to scale with demand, otherwise people just start hoarding it. And of course if supply scales with demand then it ceases to be something you can speculate on because price only goes up when demand exceeds supply.

The vast majority of people buying bitcoin (and other deflationary cryptos) are speculating on its increasing value through artificial scarcity, as soon as they run out of people to keep putting the price up then anyone who bought it just because its going to go up in price is going to sell.

No one knows exactly when this point is going to be which is why you keep seeing practice runs where a bunch of people sell at ATHs, and then buy back in when they realize there's still higher to climb. So far every crash triggered by people cashing out has been remedied by even more money flowing in, but the larger the market grows the more and more money you need to keep it growing and its not based on any underlying wealth generation so its inherently unsustainable.

Hodl and don't invest more than you're willing to lose and you'll be fine in the long term, but people are generaly way overconfident at the moment in the idea that the only way is up, and it has been this way for a while now.

What happens in such a situation is that people don't take into account the very bearish scenarios and they overextend themselves. This brings the asset into a lot of weak hands and into the hands of people who are not really strong believers or who can stomach big declines. This results in a prolonged depressed market

It's the natural way bitcoin will move up over the coming decades, big bull markets and big bear markets.

">But even if it only ever went to $100k that's still good money to be made

9 years ago $20,000 of bitcoin would now be worth billions. Making $80k off a $20k investment when its far more likely to significantly decrease now than it was 9 years ago is not a good investment.

The risk is far higher and the potential reward is much lower. The reasons buying $20,000 of bitcoin would have made you a lot of money in 2010 no longer apply.

There's other coins that have made milllion percent increases in recent months. If your fantasy is to get rich quick off a minimal investment then bitcoin is not the coin for you.


>Even if we don't make any gains, it's still sound money and im very ok storing it in Bitcoin vs a USD bank.

Bitcoin has lost 80% of its value twice in the last 8 years, one of those times it was for nearly a year.

It's had several flash crashes of 50% during that time, which would have wiped out half your worth if you were forced to liquidize during those points.

How is that more ""sound"" than the USD? USD loses 0-3% of its value a year, which is far more tolerable than losing 80% of its value for a year. If you want something that goes up in value you can buy it with USD. USD is for buying and selling, not saving.

Someone who got paid in bitcoin a month ago now has lot less wealth than if they would if they were just paid in dollars.

"Gold isn't useless.

Most demand for gold comes from the jewelry industry. It's the most popular jewelry metal in the world. There's also about 10% of demand that comes from the electronics, food and medical industry.

Gold has many uses. It's not valuable just because its rare. Platinum is far rarer than gold but gold is more valuable because demand for gold is higher.

This is why ""bitcoin is just like gold!"" is not a good argument. It's based on a misconception that gold was just arbitrarily chosen to be a ""store of value"". It's a store of value because its rare and there's a lot of consistent demand for it, although it gets less consistent during times of manic speculation.

People want to pretend gold is a store of value because people speculate on it and then transfer that reasoning to bitcoin is a store of value because people speculate on it, even if it has no other uses.

Speculation only makes sense if there's some value you're trying to exploit. Speculating on other people speculating is just gambling on who's going to be left holding the bag.";1;0;False;suninabox;ds9y3ui;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg

At that point with most unable to continue investing who would keep putting money in? 

I realize people can invest smaller amounts, but it seems a tad optimistic that bitcoin would reach $200k, through individuals. And I get the sense that finical institutions and governments are not not interested in helping create a viable alternative to their established systems, from which they profit. Use it to make money in the short/mediums term sure, but not to the point of hamstringing their own game.

"This depends on if you want Bitcoin to have a savings type role or a currency type role. This is the same reason India had bimetalism. Silver was used for everyday transactions and gold for large value ones. Since gold and silver could be swapped directly (atomic swaps) or at exchanges this worked. Other countries used currency representing a small portion of gold.

Either of these could work if we can accept a future with two dominant cryptos. Personally I think ether type is better suited to cash role and Bitcoin type to gold type role.";2;1;False;Dachsdev;ds9plq4;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg

"Yea! Because price increases of 1600% are totally good for Bitcoin, right? You guys need to realize that this kind of volatility (either negative or positive) is what is ultimately hurting Bitcoin right now. You want higher prices, which means you want higher adoption from people right? 

The problem is that with higher adoption, more people join and the network gets clogged even more. Now, the mempool is at 180k transactions. Can you imagine what would happen if so many new users joined this year? Bitcoin needs time to stabilize and solve its scalability issues before that happens. Otherwise, it's going to keep losing its dominance to altcoins.

Of course, someone will come in and say that LN is here but the truth is that it's not. And it most likely won't help to relieve the network congestion anytime soon. The same was said about Segwit and adoption is still really small (11% right now). What makes you think that all these exchanges/wallets and new users will adopt LN as soon as it becomes feasible?

It's time to stop focusing on the stupid lambo and price memes and focus on actually helping Bitcoin to be usable again. Now, everyone is just banking that people will keep buying at higher prices so you can make money on your BTC that you bought for cheaper.

Let's solve the issues first and focus on the memes later. This mentality and greed just hurts BTC";10;7;False;lawmaster99;ds9lmap;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg

"“There are almost 200 currencies of the world, but there’s only one international currency. There are almost 200 currencies controlled by central banks and governments, but there is only one mathematical currency today, and that is bitcoin. We are going to build more of them. Cryptographic currencies are going to be a mainstay of our financial future. They are going to be a part of the future of this planet because they have been invented. It’s as simple as that. You cannot un-invent this technology. You cannot turn this omelette back into eggs.”

">Crypto isn't going anywhere. You can't unring this bell.

Exactly.  People talk about this stuff like it's a fad.  It's no more a fad than cars are a fad.  Maybe we'll be on to different cryptos in the future, but the concept of electronic gold/money.

One of the most empowering things there is about this technology is something Peter Thiel described as bitcoin being a bearer security as opposed to a traditional registered security... meaning that we have ""physical, lol"" ownership of this stuff.  When we want access to the bitcoin we own, we don't have to petition a company to send it to us and it can't be taken through civil forfeiture or suspended through legal action.";5;2;False;FermiAnyon;ds9h2br;Who says you only HODL once?;7of9eo;https://i.redd.it/czdcgnjz1c801.jpg
