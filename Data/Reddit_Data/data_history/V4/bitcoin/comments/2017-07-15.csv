"I think we would come full circle if I started repeating my reasoning.

You and I obviously have a different view of what the FED (or any central bank) can or should do.  I will begin by stating my views and what I think your probably are.

I take it you think that raising or lowering interest rates through a direct expansion or contraction of the money supply by the FED (when it buys government debt, or loans to banks), and the general lowering of interest rates that occurs through the existance of fractional reserve banking and both good things.  I think they are both bad things.

If fractional reserve banking didn't exist (if banks that tried to do that were punished for fraud), and if the FED didn't even exist, then loans would only happen when borrowers and lenders (either people who had saved their own money to invest, or people who managed funds that people had invested for the purpose of making loans) met to discuss terms.  The borrowers would explain why they wanted to borrow money, and what the upside was (they would present a business plan).  The lenders would then subject those plans to scrunity to decide how risky they thought the plans were, and offer a higher interest rate to riskier plans and lower rates to the low risk plans.

""The Interest Rate"" at any given time would be the average of the loans recently created.  By measuring it for a particular sector of the economy, you would get an indicator of how risky the average business plans were for that sector.

The market mechanism for arriving at interest rates would work to bring scrunity to business plans.

Whenever you put policy pressure on an economic indicator, it ceases to be an economic indicator.  Lowering interest rates by printing money has the effect of draining the economy of the business plan scrunity required to make it efficient and innovative.

Just like artificially lowering the cost of oil (by making it illegal to charge more than X for a barrell of oil, say), would drain the economy of innovation in producing and distributing oil.

It makes no more sense to set interest rates than it does to try to set commodity prices.

In both cases, it prevents markets from working efficiently and inventively.

I am curious to know what you think is going to happen in the next few years with bitcoin.  Do you think it will collapse on its own?  Or do you think it is a threat to the ability of the FED to manage the business cycle and should be made illegal for the public good?

I think bitcoin is going to continue to grow in influence and market cap in proportion to the amount of QE that the FED, the ECB, and the BOJ engage in, ultimately relieving those CBs of their ability to print money.  Which will upend the governmental budgetary process and greatly scale back the prepetual debt spending that the U.S. and other governments have been increasingly doing the years.

It will be a rough transition but we will come out the other side of it with a much more productive economy and with a higher standard of living overall.

I suspect you think that setting interest rates is necessary to manage the business cycle.";1;0;False;SilencingNarrative;dk8ftzq;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg
