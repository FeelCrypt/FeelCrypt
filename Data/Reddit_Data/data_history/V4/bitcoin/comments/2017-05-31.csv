Yeah, there should be some videos out there about how paper wallets work and how they can store value.  Other things you can look up is how anyone can own bitcoin since it's digital (the key is one way encryption).  I think looking up those topics should get you going on how bitcoin can be sent and stored to addresses that are generated offline.  If you have any questions feel free to post a comment. ;1;0;False;bittyc;di90z2b;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper. It's 8 pages long and still the most lucid description of the system that I've ever read.;6dsot4;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
