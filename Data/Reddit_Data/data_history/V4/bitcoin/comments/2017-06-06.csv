Bernie Madhoff's fund was worth $68 billion at it's peak.   Must have been better than Bitcoin!

ETH has cool tech, but it has no legitimate use cases except for a proliferation of ICO ponzi schemes.   This is the primary use case for ETH right now, the primary driver of its # of txns and value.    It could last forever.   Ponzi schemes are a traditional and common scam, and ETH makes them easy to execute.

But I don' think that's really going to sustain ETH in the long term.   Nobody who does business every day *actually uses* ETH on the street.  And nobody will *because of the way it's managed and run*.   

Bitcoin is trusted because it's extremely resistant to change.

You only have a limited number of hours in your life to explore and understand things. Don't beat yourself up for not discovering the good properties of this one thing that started only in 2009.

i had a weirder entry into the game. I paid $100 for 0.17 bitcoin and put it in a sports gambling website. Ended the football season with 0.51 bitcoin (even with taking a huge loss on the falcons dumbass blunder). I checked what that was in USD (i don't recall when) and to my surprise bitcoin had risen from ~$600 to about $1300... so i just let it sit there and then i decided bitcoin was a good investment so i put that money into my wallet rather than gambling with potential profit. Then I bought another half bitcoin to complete my whole bitcoin, when it was like $1700.

Right now, the market should be dropping, not rising, due to the dispute between miners and devs, but it's just totally ignored. The fee fiasco is ignored. The market is behaving irrationally.

"True, but I've resigned myself to having missed the boat on this one. Maybe I'll be wrong and look back at this conversation and say ""well shit"" again. But that's kind of my mindset. 

What I can afford to invest right now would not return life-changing results by my calculations. 

I could likely scrounge enough up to make for a pretty cool little bonus in the year if the value seriously skyrocketed in the next few years but I simply could not invest enough right now to be jumping for joy like a giddy child when that happens.

The folks who invested $3,000 back when it was $30 to get 100 coins though, they are sitting on something like $2-300k right now. That's pretty darned life changing. That was the time to take a bit of a risk. 

Maybe this is a dumb opinion. Not sure. But I have eggs in other baskets and we'll see where those go.

The fact that some people don’t like having to pay high prices doesn’t mean everyone will leave. Some may, but the fee market is self-correcting. If enough people leave, the fees come down, making Bitcoin transactions more attractive.

"You know, as an armchair observer from quite afar, I'm just so happy for all you folks who are in this stuff.

I heard about bitcoin for the first time when I think it was worth $30 or whatever. Didn't pay it much mind. 

Then I heard it was up to like $500 a while later and though ""Jesus, should have got it at $30, it probably will pop or won't go much higher, maybe it will hit like $700 but whatever"". 

Then I heard it hit $1000. Damn. 

Now $2800? Christ. 

Like... as a relatively tech-savvy person this is exactly the kind of thing that should have been on my radar at the onset but the lack of available funds always has me stuck on the sidelines with this stuff. Even if I genuinely thought this can hit $10k, I don't have the funds to jump on it without using debt.

"Reminder for the new users: there was no good real reason to sell last times and there is no real reason to sell now based on the incoming split/fork FUD. Only new and weak hands get shaken out of their coins. Bitcoin will be OK no matter what. For the long term, we know the forecast is MOON. For the short term these are the two options:

1) Bitcoin development/price growth stalls or slows down if there is no agreement and Jihan/Roger have their way (price continue to rise but at a slow pace).

2) There is a scaling agreement, SegWit+LN activate and the price flies past $10,000 before the end of the year.

So, no matter what, HODL. If there is a deep, buy more.

"My personal advice (and this is *personal*, and in no way the *correct* advice): Don't.

1. Diversification is the preferred way of investing. What if Ethereum rises a lot tomorrow? You'll not be making those gains. What if Bitcoin falls, even if a bit, and Etheruem rises, even if a bit? You could have minimized your losses. My portfolio for example, has about 30% Bitcoin, 20% Litecoin, 25% Ethereum and 25% Monero. Note that I have not only bought different currencies, but also different *types* of currencies.
2. You don't want to buy an asset only because of the hype. Investigate and find out if the ""intrinsic"" price of an asset is close to the current market price. If the market price is too high, it will fall; if it's too low, it will rise. That's what they they mean when they say that the market is self-correcting. I know more about Bitcoin than most. I don't know enough about Ethereum, I feel. But I keep reading.
3. Very, very few people can predict how an asset will *exactly* behave in the future. And by ""very few"", I mean, probably Warren Buffet and maybe 5 other people in the world. Fun fact about Warren Buffet: He does not invest in technology stocks because he says he doesn't understand them. I consider Bitcoin to be one of the most advanced technologies of the time. So, people who believe they can correctly predict Bitcoin are just guessing. (I mean, there is nothing wrong with that. I am guessing too; I bought some Bitcoin in the past week.)

Consider all these facts, and maybe others, do your research, and make an informed decision based on them. Don't be emotional and scared of losing out on making gains. Be sure to write down your reasons on why you are selling Ethereum, if you are. Read and re-read those reasons, and make sure that they sound logical.

Best of luck!

An update: Monero, for example, has risen 13.38% since yesterday compared to Bitcoin's 9.91%. Litecoin has risen 3.91%, while Eth 3.66%.

People see it as a good store of value because it has done nothing but rise in the long term.  The entry point is pretty low too since exchanges are so prolific and have relationships with traditional markets for easy conversion.  People are familiar with signing up with online services at this point.  This is fueling huge money because many feel that our systems are corrupt and rigged against them so they want a place with a more even playing field.  This desire by the populace has always been present and only lacked a vehicle that overcomes the issues of trust and bitcoin is the first to do that.  There are many more factors but I see these as the most important.  We have this new fangled financial system that is fair and the entry point is low.  It comes with high risk and a reward proportional to that risk.;3;0;False;wowbat;dijeezs;$2800! Welcome back, old friend.

"So a few years back I decided to try to put together a timeline of meaningful events in the formative years of bitcoin. There were so many thefts/heists/scams early on that netted people tens of thousands of bitcoins, and I've been extremely bullish since day 1, so I wanted to gather some info. I put this together years ago, when the price wasn't anywhere near what it is now, and even then these were some of the biggest ""heists"" ever committed and were virtually unknown.

"There is no real scaling solution other than increasing block size or reducing block time, segwit doesn't provide scaling immediately, unless everyone magically start doing 100% segwit tx, even then it's a minor scaling solution to 1.7mb.

It does provide the possibility of side chain, which can be a good scaling solution, but possibly sacrifices decentralization.";1;1;False;6to23;dij2s45;$2800! Welcome back, old friend. Pardon me, I don't believe we've met.;6fiz91;https://i.redd.it/z4skyjpirx1z.jpg

"> I think it'll finish chugging this round then pass out and collapse.

That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $1000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on.

This is the best Bitcoin investment advice:
