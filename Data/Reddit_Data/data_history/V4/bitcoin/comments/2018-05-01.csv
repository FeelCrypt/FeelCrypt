WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) was the first web browser and editor. It was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence, as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.

The source code was released into the public domain on April 30, 1993.

">what i mean is, wont banks have no capital because people wont need to store their money in them. 

People can **currently** store cash themselves. They've been able to do it for millennia. They don't need banks. Most don't go it alone because they don't want the responsibility and liability to store and protect it.

I don't know why people expect that to change. The average person practices horrific IT security and is not responsible enough to be perfect protecting their wallets for a lifetime.

"If I may sound like an old fart for a moment, this is what pains me about kids today and their computing experience. Sure they have in their pockets a computer far more powerful than what we had as a desktop but many of them have no idea of even the basics of what's going on inside and even if they did, they can't really modify things as manufactures keep sealing them.  My current Dell laptop is completely sealed up so if I ever need to change a battery on that thing even, I'll have to google the hell out of it.  

But yeah, I learned so much back then! For instance, The [IBM PS/1 Model 2121 G42](https://www.tietokonemuseo.net/tietokoneita/ibm-ps1-model-2011/) we got from Sam's had a slow ass 2400 baud modem which was enough for me to get on BBSes but we decided to get a 14.4k modem for it and had no idea where it went...nothing inside looked like the modem's connectors.  It turned out, the damn thing wasn't an ISA architecture like every other PC, but Microchannel bus - essentially the Betamax of computer buses where it was technically better, but nobody used it.

">Their role in the modern day society is to allocate capital to the best projects.

They don't allocate to the ""best"".. they allocate to the highest perceived financial risk/reward.. So if a risk or reward doesn't easily lend itself to being translated into a balance sheet, it is ignored. 

In practice this means banks give money to those who already have it because they can put money into giving off a perception of reduced risk and increased reward.  And financially this is the right thing to do.  The best predictor of success is how much money some entity already has.  This isn't because of some greater inherent value, but because of the exact point that I just made--it's a positive feedback loop.  (money/investments/assets/revenue) <-> (perception of success/advertising budget/time spent on pitch deck/time to polish presentation/etc.)

But don't act like banks are doing us a favor.  There's already a tendency for people with money to get more money thrown at them.  Banks are just another entity trying to ride those coattails.

"If you're paying for goods from an account owned by the same entity as the payment processor, you're still paying with Bitcoin. It's just that the transaction doesn't have to be made on chain, because the trustlessness of the blockchain is not required because there is no second entity to trust.

It's like if you go into the shop owned by your parents on pocket money day. They have custody of ""your"" pocket money (let's say $5). It is by all accounts your money, it's just that they have possession of it. You want a $1 chocolate bar. What happens here? Well there's no point in them giving you $5 only for you to return $1. So you take the chocolate bar, and they now hold $4 of your pocket money. The fact that no money changes hands is analogous to the fact that no on chain transaction is necessary.

This analogy is accurate because technically if you're money is in a hot wallet, you don't own it. So money can be rerouted without fees by the wallet and payment processor (if they are the same entity, as in this case).

"That's why there is so much effort put into making lightning network, rather than a copy of our current Banks/Pay-Pal.  

I personally wouldn't call a solution like Bitflyer to Bitflyer payments a bad interim solution while people are still in the process of adopting Bitcoin/crypto.  
  
The main idea is to move from a trust system to a trust-less one.   We live in a world where everything is setup around trust systems, so we have to transition from one setup and mindset to another.  
This doesn't go equally easy for everyone.  

So in my opinion while we are making trust-less transactions be as ""convenient"" as the ones everyone is currently used to through 3rd parties like Pay-Pal/Visa.  
There should be ways that let people go about their crypto in the same way as those 3rd parties let them do it even though that means using these ""trusted"" 3rd parties for now.  

If people are already using crypto even before we can transact as conveniently in trust-less ways as we do through 3rd parties, then they will have much easier time transitioning to the trust-less solutions without having to get used to handling crypto first.  

I guess what I'm trying to say is that these kind of solutions help the adoption for the general public as simply owning (a little bit of) crytpo even if it is on an exchange gives reason to learn more about what it is you own and spark questions and conversations about crypto.  

While the general public still learns more about crypto, in the meantime the crypto developers can move things forward into making real trust-less solutions equally convenient.

"Were a long way from global adoption. Problem is, there’s a lot of friction, especially just to get started (get your first cryptos). So I get that for now we have to compromise just to gain some traction, and let go of lofty ideals. The real issue is that the current banking and credit card system comes with little apparent downside from most common use. People don’t “see” the 3% price increase across the board and only think they get a free 1% cashback assuming they pay right away. Point is, there has to be a benefit to justify using cryptos, and right now it’s a ton of friction in order to bypass the ease of use of banks/credit cards. Right now, if something goes wrong with the bank/credit card, you know you can go just about to the street corner or call the credit card company and get help right away. With cryptos, odds are you just lost everything and that’s that. I don’t believe cryptos need that level of infrastructure; I’m simply illustrating how pervasive the friction is comparatively. If cryptos were easier to use than Apple Pay, then who knows, there’s maybe real potential. From regulation, to price instability, to many things, to even simple things like being able to pay without electricity or internet access, it’s just really lacking in terms of using cryptos as a currency.

So yeah, it might be a step in the good direction seemingly for now, and it does help lower friction, but it doesn’t inherently give a strong reason for anyone to ditch credit cards. Maybe for inter-country transfer that’s where it shines, I’m not entirely sure where else it is clearly better than alternatives. My real worry with this is that as we will creep closer towards adoption, it’s likely those existing services that have done us good to gain adoption, will just end up making it bad to use anything else besides them. Kind of like, they’d make it hard to leave their systems, so people end up just using their service and the momentum is too big to stop at this point. Kind of like Facebook (although it never had any benevolent intention at any point).

I’d say that, somewhat sadly, we’d probably be best of waiting until the tech is mature enough that it’s ready to scale to global adoption, and then we build on top of that. If we just compromise at any point, the path of least resistance is likely to take over and we’ll be fighting an uphill battle to maintain a trustless system.";3;1;False;manly_;dy94ym7;I took a trip with some friends to a sleepy rural town in Japan, hours outside of Tokyo.

"Absolutely agree with your fears and I think it's on everyone that understands the importance of trust-less systems to educate others on why we should be switching over to those from the current trusted systems (short summary: you can't trust people).  

I personally don't think that crypto can delay its adoption to wait on tech to be on par with current systems before we push for mass adoption.  
I think that adoption is needed to drive the development and get it sped up enough to catch up and overtake the current systems that we have.  

I think that adoption and tech push each other.  
More adoption, means more minds will tune into the crypto space, means faster progress, means more adoption means more progress, etc.  
As long as out of all the people that join the space there are enough people that understand the importance and necessity of trust-less solutions over trusted ones the progress on the trust-less front will speed up in tandem with the increased adoption.  

But yes the scary part is if the ""trusted"" parties will start to fight that progression to hang on to their power, but luckily that in itself can cause progress to be made on the trust-less front which would have to find ways to bypass whatever was come up with to stop them.";1;0;False;Snowaeth;dyahesf;I took a trip with some friends to a sleepy rural town in Japan, hours outside of Tokyo.

"In this specific case the point of blockchain is the fact that it secures the bitcoin which makes bitcoin a trusted source of money which in turn becomes accepted money for other payment methods such as this.  
Also in this specific case when accepted in its bitcoin form the sender does not need to convert their bitcoin to the local currency.

"Problem is, this design is trusting bitflyer to not act like a bank. As long as nobody cashes out too much, they can “pay” using bitcoins they don’t have. And if there’s ever a lot of deposit, they can also just vanish into thin air with everyone’s bitcoin.

"Excellent reply.

> In this specific case the point of blockchain is the fact that it secures the bitcoin which makes bitcoin a trusted source of money which in turn becomes accepted money for other payment methods such as this.

I'd just like to add that if bitcoin becomes a highly trusted, widely accepted money and object of value there isn't much between it and gold, and, from there, there isn't much preventing banks doing exactly what they did with gold; creating a IOU system complete with fractional reserves.

As, er, a retort to my own comment this might not happen the same as it happened with gold because bitcoin is so, so much easier to store and transfer and divide. It is a better *form* of money than gold (albeit it requires all the infrastructure of the internet to work).";3;0;False;WalksOnLego;dy8s9v8;I took a trip with some friends to a sleepy rural town in Japan, hours outside of Tokyo.

However to get on the lightning network you first have to open a lightning channel which is done on chain.  
Your lightning network channel will have a certain amount of bitcoin (the amount you put on there) on it and you can keep trading back and forth with other linked channels, including the ones the people you'r connected to are connected to and even the ones those people are connected to, etc.  
(So if you are connected to a well connected node you don't have to open other channels).
