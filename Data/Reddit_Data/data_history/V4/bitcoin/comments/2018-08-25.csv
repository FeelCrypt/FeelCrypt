"It isn't a lack of empathy being against shitty policy, look at  no-fault auto insurance rates in Michigan, everyone just ends up getting fucked then into paying ever increasing insurance premiums and those that cannot afford it end up without it anyway (50% of drivers in Detroit do not have auto insurance) now causing it to get more expensive for everyone else and on and on with this run away effect (similar to the 08-09 adjustable rate mortgage crisis).  There has to be a dynamic solution that our politicians haven't thought of yet, where both those who need care get it at a fair price, and where those who don't extract much care aren't compulsory paying for everyone else's shortfall, maybe the solution actually lies in a sort of public-private entity.

​

Unfortunately the way it is now, everyone is fucked by applying the Michigan auto insurance model to health care through law, especially the  sick working poor, which is why it unconscionable that people ever supported ACA.  It was so obviously written by the insurance companies, and will be the source of the next major economic downturn as premiums continue to rise and more people are priced out but are forced to pay or be fined (thanks Obama) and are squeezed (only this time it will be everyone squeezed, not just those who choose to buy houses).

"**World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000**

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranked the health systems of its 191 member states in its World Health Report 2000. It provided a framework and measurement approach to examine and compare aspects of health systems around the world. It developed a series of performance indicators to assess the overall level and distribution of health in the populations, and the responsiveness and financing of health care services. It was the organization's first ever analysis of the world's health systems.

"The money spent per person is much lower. You end up with the same sickness, illness, disease, etc, the same quality of care, if not better. But you pay per person much less. Because the government collectively bargains to drive down the prices of the most common meds and procedures.

This saves money overall. I'm happy if I never get sick and never have to use the NHS. I'll still pay for the welfare of everyone in my society. That's what society means.

I'd have to have paid health insurance in the US and there would have been no guarantee that it would have covered all my costs anyway, I may still have had to pay out of the nose for things that every other western nation takes for granted. I may still have had to travel far and wind for treatment.

Also, on the NHS I get health care in every country but the US, because US prices are unafforable. That should tell you something about how much you pay.
