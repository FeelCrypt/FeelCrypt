You make a valid point. But does the poor and uneducated child care if a rich person donated a hefty sum of money to help build a school carrying his name? I'm not sure that the child would care. Giving your last penny to charity may seem noble, but in the end it isn't wise to do that, considering you don't have money to eat anymore. Of course I understand, that the poor lady makes a much greater sacrifice than some guy who empties his money bag onto the offering table. But well, people much wiser than me probably already took that parable apart piece by piece and came to a different conclusion than me. ;3;2;False;s3b_;dv9f278;"""Anonymous bitcoin donor rains $56 million on stunned nonprofits"" (story about The Pinapple Fund)";826zf8;https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Anonymous-Bitcoin-Donor-Rains/242606/
"It's more the idea that, rich people sometimes give a lot to ""seem"" like they care. If a bussiness with vats resources donates to a very public charity, they'll usually do so in a way that benefits the charity, but also preserves their profits. No CEO or high-ranking person would willing give up a huge bonus for a charity.

In terms of the Bible, all offerings to God are valuable - if the person offering has their heart in the right place.

As with all things, hidden agendas ruin the sincerity of charitable acts. The Biblical parable was just a way of saying, she didn't have any hidden agenda - she only donated what she could.

"You also make a very valid point. And regarding the wiser people, of course they have - whether they're wiser or ""wiser"" we'll never know.

There are loads of stories in the Bible like this that don't make 100% these days, and some seem downright stupid... My dad always tells me to take the Bible with a bit of (I forget the exact phrasing, so don't judge my dad lol) salt, as in, consider the time frame in which it was likely written and the education levels of the general target audience.

Personally I like to think that a lot of the stories that don't make sense have simply been ""edited"" down to the point of only carrying across the message, but accidentally leaving out the logic...

"> Well, there are the ""in-between'ers"".... Then there's those like me (and there are many)

Out here in San Francisco there's been a lot of research (both public and private sector) into the distinctions of personalities and circumstances populating the streets. One thing that stood out to me was the visible homeless being such a small percent of the potentially addressable problem.

> I'm not in a rush to get back into an apartment.

Going back to 'potentially addressable problem', that was one of the realizations of ill-considered but well-meaning efforts. Many people did not want housing.

> Employers use credit scores to see if you are valuable enough to work for them.

Not all. Which ones checked your credit out of curiosity.

> I have vast employment gaps.

This is something for many to avoid, but if you have a desirable skill set it is less important. This made me wonder a little more about your circumstance: 

What are you good at? Where do you live? There are plenty of economic deadzones and you have a car so you need to go to a place with more opportunities. 

What is keeping you where you are? There are plenty of good reasons, I'm just curious. If the monotony of daily basic survival takes up all your time, then consider stocking up and hitting the road, or even selling the car and taking a bus/train somewhere.

Do you also have a criminal record? This is a contributing factor to marginalizing people outside of the workforce in many places.

Also have you considered contracting, 1099 work instead of W-2 work?

That's an interesting loop that you've presented. I can't argue with it unless you include intent. If you give due to kindness and not due to admiration and good feelings then you could be treaching into altruism. Also, what about sacrifice? The end of the definition of altruism speaks about selflessness. I've often given or helped and not thought of self. I've been in 8 years of low income and debt due to altruism actually.

"The Pineapple Fund is awesome and shows the great potential to use Bitcoin and cryptoassets for good.  Pine picked great projects that will do a lot of really great things.  I encourage you all to look to the PF website for a lot of great charities.

It is my hope that we build a future with many more generous crypto participants.  This technology, distributed public ledger, offers a whole new way to approach civilization.  More fair, more transparent, and with less wealth disparity.  This is not unrealistic and utopian, it is the inevitable direction of technologies that allow us to build societies around decentralized systems.

It's exciting to have the social and societal attitude, the economics, and the technology come together to enable a better future for all of us.  Starting with Bitcoin, which takes on the biggest stranglehold that has held back humanity, financial institutions, the banksters, the money changers.

The work I do for my organization in our small part of helping to bring this about is the most satisfying work I've done in my life, and I expect it to only improve over time, as adoption grows.

"I feel it absolutely is an autoimmune disease. For context, before getting sick I was getting my PhD in Organic Chemistry hoping to get a job designing/synthesizing new drugs and myself and a few classmates have looked at the research and come to the same conclusion. 

Many autoimmune disorders predominantly affect women and has been written off by the predominantly male medical system as “hysteria” or some other psychosomatic keyword. Other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, MS, and others were treated similarly until tests showed that the patients had physiological issues. ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, IBS and a bunch of other syndromes all seem to affect predominantly women and all have random system-wide symptoms. 

There’s a lot of clues that have been popping up in the research that suggest an auto-immune component, but there isn’t enough evidence to say it 100% is. Also, there’s probably a few different diseases within the diagnosis of ME/CFS, so research hasn’t found a way to do that either.
