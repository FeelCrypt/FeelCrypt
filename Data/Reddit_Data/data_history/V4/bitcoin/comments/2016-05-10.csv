">  The creation of debt is often inversely correlated to inflation

Real-wages have declined or stagnated in the West, while the cost of things people need to buy every day have mostly gone up, except for the recent bust of the bubble in China allowing the inexorable decline in commodity prices to continue.

> Very often countries create the most debt in deflationary scenarios to fight severe recession and because tax revenues fall during recessions.

Yes and this causes real wages to decline. What other definition of inflation is relevant. Duh.

I will not continue to argue with an Dunning-Kruger idiot. I have more important work to do. So enjoy your oversized opinion of yourself in your next ""rebuttal"", lol.

> The lenders have locked in rates and so are tremendously hurt by inflation.

These are the retirement plans, i.e. the common people. The rich are not those lenders in this ZIRP economy.

> You literally have it exactly backwards. Inflation hurts rich lenders and helps poor borrowers.

You literally are an idiot.
