Why would you expect it to be at 30k now? You'd be an idiot. That's unsustainable growth. Come back in two years and tell me this. Please. The moment the growth went parabolic rising above 7k, I knew there would be a big pullback. This is normal. I have still made a profit and I am still as bullish long term as I was 6 months ago.;1;1;False;Tricky_Troll;dwkn8gt;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
