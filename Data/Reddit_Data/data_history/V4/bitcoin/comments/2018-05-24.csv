Edit: I profiled my program and found most time is spent in the sha512 hash function for converting the mnemonic to a seed for generating the address. Given I can get about an 8th of the speed per core my guess is it's due to my Ryzen lacking the AVX512 instructions that modern Intel chips have, which are said to handle SHA512 about 8 times faster.

"Ok, here are my thoughts about this \(because I am giving up, because I think this is way over my level if I am even remotely right\). Lets get through all the clues first

1. You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture
2. Think in pairs
3. Code easily, attack early
4. Lost transaction costs almost users
5. 00212121
6. Try \+1
7. Almost open
8. Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)
9. \-1

**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**

**MY ANSWER:**

**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.

**Second**, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)

I base my opinion because:

**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.

>Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To ""own"" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair*** What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)

I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.

**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.

Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue.**

**Fifth clue**: 00212121

Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.

**Sixth and ninth clue**: Try \+1, \-1.

Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)

**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.

It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)

**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.

"**Attack model**

In cryptanalysis, attack models or attack types[1] are a classification of cryptographic attacks specifying the kind of access a cryptanalyst has to a system under attack when attempting to ""break"" an encrypted message (also known as ciphertext) generated by the system. The greater the access the cryptanalyst has to the system, the more useful information he can get to utilize for breaking the cypher.

In cryptography, a sending party uses a cipher to encrypt (transform) a secret plaintext into a ciphertext, which is sent over an insecure communication channel to the receiving party. The receiving party uses an inverse cipher to decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the plaintext.

My point: Forget the clues for a minute and focus just on the pic and the initial message with it. Y**ou are supposed to solve the puzzle with just that, nothing more.**

I personally don't see any indication in the pic, o the initial message suggesting 12 pairs of words \+1 then eliminating the 25th word \-1. Point is: if you come up with the idea of eliminating the 25th word, hence \-1, it should logically come from just form the pic and the initial message. If it doesn't, it just might not be the right answer.

"I'm currently stuck on the idea that the word pairs translate  to numbers. The digits 0-9 are all inside of the circle, and I don't think this is coincidence. I have tried encoding the words with both their ascii and hex values, but have no idea what to do with the numbers.

For example, 'code easily' have hex values of 36 and 65. What do we do with this? Draw lines connecting the numbers? Take that shape and move it onto the X? I don't get it.

Some simple python functions if anyone finds this useful:

    #ascii summer
    def ascii_sum(word):
        return sum([ord(x) for x in word])
     
    #hex summer
    def hex_sum(word):
        hexstr = ''.join([hex(ord(x)) for x in word])
        hexsum = sum([int(x) for x in hexstr if x.isdigit()])
        return hexsum
     
    #binary summer
    def bin_sum(word):
        binstr = ''.join(format(ord(x), 'b') for x in word)
        binsum = sum([int(x) for x in binstr])
        return binsum

Also had the idea that word pairs are anagrams of a seed word, but that didn't lead anywhere useful:

    #anagram solver
    def solve(words):
        res = []
        for word in words:
            if any([x in pair[0] for x in word]) and any([x in  pair[1] for x in word]) and all([x in ''.join((pair[0],pair[1])) for x in word]):
                res.append((pair, word))
        for r in res:

It uses the white BIP39 words in the circle and pairs them up into 9 pairs and then adding the pairs from hints ""code easily"" ""almost open"" ""attack early"" randomly somewhere in there to give a 24 word seed generated with paired words

It created around 20,000-30,000 valid seeds from around 10million combinations all with 0 balance.
