Really what fundamentals? please enlighten me.  The data shows that most of bitcoin transactions are speculative churning and not from people actually using bitcoin to buy things, those business transactions are super low even if they range wide they are still only a drop on the bucket compared to the transactions that are just people buying and selling bitcoin on the exchange.  So what you all are saying is that you believe bitcoin is going to skyrocket because transaction volume increases but what the idiot salesman on youtube forgot to tell you is that that all that transaction volume growth is just exchange churning and not from more people buying things with bitcoin.  The NYSE now has futures for cryptos and bitcoin is still down. If it had any sort of fundamentals to support a higher future value it would have rallied a bit at least, but it kept going down.   My best guess is that most bitcoin “investors” just see transaction volume up and think “hey more people are using it”, which is false, then they see marketing for bitcoin say that this and that company is going to accept bitcoin and they say “confirmed, im rich in the future”, false again.   I’ve enjoyed a lot of dinners on my bitcoin short sells, or should I say on all of the money you hard headed fanboys throw at me.  But hey at least I’m warning you people, and not being a sleazebag like the bitcoin salesmen.;1;1;False;FuriouslyKindHermes;f1calg1;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
IF thats what you force yourself to beleive Then you will wake up in your own urine covered in potato chip crumbs with newspapers stuffed in between you and the floor you frequent as a homeless idiot who didn’t listen to evidence-based warnings. I told you bitcoin fanboys, when everyone said it was going past 20,000 again, and it was around 10,000-11,000, that it was going to back down to around 5-8k.  It went from 13k back down to 9.2k... now what? 100k lol? No, probably 5-8k. But 1k would not suprise me.;1;0;False;FuriouslyKindHermes;f1c8mwu;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
What happened with all the big talk and delicious tears of never ending sorrow? From 13,000 down to 9,200, might reach some sort of real usage value + speculative future value equilibrium at idk 5-8k? Everyone downvoted me, they said it was going to skyrocket with baseless claims.

"I appreciate taking the time to type this and trying to help. I am also glad you are making money on the trades (I do not have the confidence on beating the market, so I stay out of trading).

Regarding the question of 'what fundamentals'? It is not about transaction volume or usage (I agree with you on the opaqueness of transactions).

Bitcoin value derives mostly from scarcity, stock-to-flow ratio and its antifragile architecture. These characteristics are still strong.

I don't speak for other investors. It is a long term bet. A risky one, with the possibilty of assimetric returns.

For anyone else reading this, only invest in this kind of asset with money you are willing to lose and that is not needed soon.";1;1;False;BaraStarkGaryenSter;f1cgccr;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21

I'd agree since every trader knows that the asset can go down only 100% and at the end of the day its just another nice opportunity to add to your position, while in an uptrend we can go up an unknown amount and theres a level of anxiety that comes with not knowing where the top is and when it would be good to start pulling out money.;11;0;False;F1Suicide;f1cmpli;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg

"No bear folks! It's a common pattern to trigger massive stop-loss orders from overleveraged long traders in order to prevent future selling pressure during the uptrend and to get cheap prices before skyrocketting prices soar.

So the third wave (strongest) is officially open today with this great volatility increase. First wave was x3 from $120 to $360 so wave 3 should be x5 or x8 from $150 today's bottom to $750 or $1200 by Jan-Mar 2020.

It's not repetitive, with all the awareness about Bitcoin we have globally, we should have been now easily at 100k per coin. The stupidity of many is this trend is to think they are the only ones to understand what means Bitcoin. Wrong! most of the rich people on this planet have a great understanding of what Bitcoin is but Alas, there is like 100 mln wealthy people on this planet and at least 10% know enough goodies about Bitcoin. But they would have invested buying at least 1 BTC. Do you see that happening ? No! So the end of the story, Bitcoin is not attractive to the all if not most of the investor community , end of line, seat and enjoy posting pics and gifs but in the near future don't expect to see much of miracles I'd say.;0;1;False;Digiff;f1cmkp3;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
