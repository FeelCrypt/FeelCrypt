"I'm thinking about the average investor requiring stability in their finances. They cannot afford to be stuck in a several decade bear market, or lose to some unexpeceted regulation or fault that no one could foresee. If crypto crashed the 90% it did after the 2013 rally, and they had to wait more than 3 years to break even, a lot of ordinary investors may exit and lose money, or cannot afford that level of fluctuation in their net worth, for debt reasons, or otherwise. 

I think we're both generally in agreement. But crypto is not an investment. It is speculation. Which is fine. But thats what it is. You're not contributing to research, development, or asset growth in a  meaningful way when buying bitcoin.

You're gambling that someone will pay more down the road. It's not a bad gamble. It's not a great gamble, though. It's a fine gamble, but whether this is the final bubble or not, it is very likely crypto will hit a peak which wont be seen again for decades, and many crypto will fail. This reality, that at some point, a lot of investors will likely lose money, gives it a similar risk profile to option contracts on promising blue chips. 

All that being said, I have 25% of my net worth in crypto. But my net worth is very little, and has mostly come from crypto investments anyway. I wouldnt recommend anyone put more into crypto than they can truly afford to lose. ";2;1;False;aesu;dnge3mt;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg
"""Good investments have very low volatility, risk, and steady returns.""

Typically this is correct. However not in all circumstances. You are thinking with typical finance school analysis, good for asset classes with long term historical data and understanding to apply valuation and predict trends, but not necessarily good for crypto.

The bubble talk is again ludicrous, the dotcom bubble was for 10 trillion in today's dollar terms and crypto is worth 150b. The market caps are not even remotely equivalent.

You won't be convinced either way and again whether crypto investment is worthwhile depends on portfolio structure, risk profile and investment period, so it isn't for everyone but as someone who works in finance I can't see a better opportunity for a 5 year investment return at this risk level, which I see as similar to typical small cap indexes assuming 10x returns.
";1;1;False;Jean_Luc_Bergman;dngd69k;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg
"I didn't I said for equivalent risk. Rember 50x upside is the very best case scenario, if everything goes unbelievably well for the next decade. Even you admit 2 trillion is a realistic estimate, which is a 16x increase. But it comes with a very high risk. 

There are many investments with 16x upside potential, with similar risk profiles. Especially on smaller amounts of capital. Your point about me being a billionare reveals how inevitable you think cryptos rise is. There are loads of mid caps, loads of small businesses, and assets which could increase by that much. The point is, most wont. Theres a huge chance crypto wont. Thats why I, and most people are not billionares, for one. But the real reason is, that me and most people cannot invest the 80 million you would need to become a billionare from a 16x return. Or even the 20 million you'd need on a 50x return.

I said decades long. it's been in a 40 year bear market. http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart

And your comment about the internet is surely supports my argument. I am not arguing crypto is irrelevant. Just like no one really argued the internet was irrelevant. I'm arguing that buying intot the dot com bubble was a bad idea for most people. Many lost because they didnt time the bottom, didnt spread their bets, and even if they did, the few companies who survived it have only reached their dot com peaks in the past few years.

If crypto follows the internet, 99% of cryptos will be worth nothing after a huge bubble, which takes decades for the handful which do survive to recover. Thats a terribel investment. Maybe a goo gamble, if you think the real buble is to come, and you time the top. Good investments have very low volatility, risk, and steady returns.";1;1;False;aesu;dng9gkv;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg
"Point me to those 50x upside potential investment opportunities that have a workable product and community that supports them. To suggest mid-risk microcaps with this potential exist and are visible everywhere is ludicrous. Fucking insane and if it was true you'd be a billionaire. Comparing bitcoin to a random startup without a product is simply retarded.

For the past 4 years Bitcoin has gone straight up and by hundreds of percent while the market cap is still small, and use-case value is significantly higher. Volatility risk over the 3-5 year span which is the investment period advocated by most investment managers is extremely low.

I agree the number you put for a crypto market cap of 5-10 trillion is over ambitious, but 1-2 certainly isn't. Either way, 150bish is still extremely low with a massive upside.

Also gold isn't a decade long bear market. It was a 4 year bear market from 11-15, but 7-11 and 15-17 a bull market by any stretch if we are looking at what is considered the numbers of equity ""bull"" markets.

""Thats a huge risk. Dismiss it however you will. But if you think, for any reason, investing in an asset which threatens every nation state on earth, if it reaches your target prices, is a good idea, you're not a good investor. Maybe a good gambler.""

This same argument was made about the internet, the fact that crypto offers the potential to do this and do it efficiently with better scaling solutions is enough to convince one to invest.";3;1;False;Jean_Luc_Bergman;dng8eeq;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg
"The long term risks are multifold. For casual investors, yearly volatility of bitcoin magnitude is definitely a risk. 

As for long term, you have already described crypto as a serious threat to existing finnacial systems. There is no way, none. Zero. Zilch, that america would allow cryptos to reach the valuations you suggest without shutting the down or resting control over them. They cannot possibly risk enriching unknown parties, who may now be worth more than any human ever, and have anti-american ideas.

Thats a huge risk. Dismiss it however you will. But if you think, for any reason, investing in an asset which threatens every nation state on earth, if it reaches your target prices, is a good idea, you're not a good investor. Maybe a good gambler.

But you're not even that, at this point. Since, even asssuming unbelievable returns, crypto total cap going to 5-10 trillion dollars in the next decade. Which would be extraordinary. I think we can both agree on that. It would really mean some huge political, social and economic breakthroughs have occured in a very short period, for crypto.


Even if we do assume that blue sky scenario, and you spread your bets perfectly across all crypto, you're looking at a best case return of 50x your money. 

Which is no better than if you found a startup trading at 10 million, and expected it might reach $500 million. Something thousands of startups who eventually went bust have achieved. Yet your risk, with crypto, is that governments see it as a threat and literally outlaw it. 

I can point to hundreds of investments with a 50x upside potential, which pose no threat to nation states. Crypto is no longer a good gamble. it's certainly not a good investment, since there are no fundamentals to invest in. It's a speculative asset. 

And speculative assets do not make for good investment vehicles, as golds decade long bear market, demonstrates.

Amazon,Ebay and Google were among some really great assets but there were also a lot of BS companies or companies that - though surviving the bubble - have been put away by better concepts a few years later (Yahoo). 

The same will happen to Crypto. We don't know yet which concepts will survive or dominate in 10-15 years. We can make some assumptions that i.e. BTC could be like Amazon or Ethereum like Google. 

But it could well be that Ethereum or NEO are more of a Yahoo or something like the Netscape Navigator or Altavista: successfull in the beginning but dead in 5 years.

Time will tell. 95% of what we see today will be gone in 10 years and there will be a lot of new concepts that we can't even imagine today (like Facebook, Spotify, Snapchat). ";5;1;False;BeePee75;dnfywqd;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg

">The US may be strong, but do you really think it's stronger than the internet

??? Today? Wildly so, yes. It's pure fantasy to think otherwise.

>with all its corruption in the finance industry

You're implying current Wall Street fraud significantly affects the backing of the USD. It doesn't compared to many other things. Things like political games over our debt ceiling do.

>Will people really be as faithful in our government as they will be in bitcoin when another crisis happens and bitcoin surges in price?

Yes, if you're comparing those two things. People who frequent cryptocurrency social communities on the Internet might not, but the average American certainly will. The average American doesn't even get the concept that the USD only has value because people say it does. They just think it has value. Also, that's a bold assumption to make about Bitcoin rising if we enter another crisis. You can't predict it, and certainly can't declare it without being foolish...

>entity that can create dollars from thin air to lend, and they do it

Again, kind of right, but really off in a fundamental sense, and the nuance is drastically important.

>company that lends taxpayer money to the taxpayers so they can make an interest

I mean, if you want to misconstrue things yeah. They paid back the TARP loans with interest, which were designed strictly to keep banks open and to keep them lending. It was part of drastic and experimental measures taken by the Federal Reserve to avoid complete global economic collapse.

They were given taxpayer money on the understanding that they would continue to lend. If they stopped lending, spending would stop, and the economy would freeze. They had to keep lending. I guess they could have lent at 0%? But the whole point of the loan was to keep things working like normal as well as possible. Then when the ship wasn't an inch from capsizing we could look at regulatory reform.

They ""took taxpayer money"" to continue lending and keep the economy functioning. Then they paid that money back with interest.

>Corrupt. Bitcoin cannot be corrupted.

That wasn't corrupt, and that has nothing to do with the dollar itself. And if bitcoin is used as a currency, it's just as open to that kind of corruption. All it is fundamentally is a transfer of value or wealth. A representation of wealth and a tool.

>You talk about how much money and military strength the US has, but even politicians and soldiers get paid in dollars and the dollar is declining.

You're again ignorant if you think politicians, at least ones who deal at all with fiscal or monetary policy affecting the USD, do it for money. They'd make much more elsewhere. The dollar isn't declining, at least not in any way that you're implying.

>Do you think bitcoin will do [this](https://imgur.com/oglrpqW)?

Misleading af lol. Inflation, oh no, something most economists agree is a good thing for a central currency to have in small amounts over time. You get that's literally an inflation chart right?

"A lot of people flash new OS's, it's very common among normal consumers. I have a Xiaomi Mi5, I flashed LineageOS when I got the phone because I wanted a more stock android feel. Then I flashed MIUI a few months ago to try out how Xiaomi's OS is. Then I flashed the new version of LineageOS, but I preferred the performance and battery life of MIUI so I flashed a custom version called Xiaomi.EU which is an unofficial version of MIUI with a few changes. 

It's still android, it's just different versions. It's not difficult at all, if you can plug your phone into a pc, you can flash a new OS and gain a lot of new features.";1;1;False;;dngfshl;Get your priorities straight;725wvf;https://i.redd.it/yzbxiqlntunz.jpg

"It was done through a ""security update"". Most modern OS's will automatically install security updates from the OS maintainer, iOS, android, linux, macOS or Windows. If you have automatic security updates turned on (or it is forced on), then you are trusting the OS maintainer not to pwn your shit. Use an OS with a maintainer that you trust won't do something malicious like this, or use an OS that lets you disable automatic updates.

But I do agree with you that not all android device manufacturers sell their phones without restrictions. However some do, and because many parts of android are open source many of the phones that are locked down usually get unlocked really well by the community, to the point you can replace the entire OS and avoid situations like this. In this case the note 7 kernel was open source, and the malicious update was a kernel update, so removing it was quite easy.

Had Apple done something similar to this with iOS devices, recovering the phone and ensuring it won't happen again would be much much harder.";1;1;False;cowardlyalien;dngeipx;Get your priorities straight;725wvf;https://i.redd.it/yzbxiqlntunz.jpg
