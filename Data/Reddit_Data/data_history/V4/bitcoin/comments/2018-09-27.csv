"Mcdonalds cant go in your house and shoot you and take your gold. Fiat money is backed by govt force. 

 Numerous individuals and companies were prosecuted related to [President Roosevelt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) Executive Order 6102. The prosecutions took place under subsequent Executive Orders 6111,[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-7) 6260,[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-8) 6261[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-9) and the [Gold Reserve Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act_of_1934). 

There was a need to strengthen Executive Order 6102, as the one prosecution under the order was ruled invalid by federal judge [John M. Woolsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Woolsey), on the grounds that the order was signed by the President, not the [Secretary of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury) as required.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-10) 

The circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell had one deposit at [Chase National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_National_Bank)  of over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to  withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell sued Chase. A federal  prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27,  1933) for failing to surrender his gold.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-11)  Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of  the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was  confiscated. 

The case was cause for the Roosevelt administration to issue a new order under the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury, [Henry Morgenthau, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau,_Jr.),  Executive Orders [6260](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6260), [6261](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6261), related to the seizure of gold and the prosecution of gold hoarders. A few months later, Congress passed the [Gold Reserve Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act_of_1934)  which ratified President Roosevelt's orders. A new set of Treasury  regulations was issued providing civil penalties of confiscation of all  gold and imposition of fines equal to double the value of the gold  seized. 

Prosecutions of U.S. citizens and non-citizens followed the new orders, with a few notable cases: 

Gus Farber, a diamond and jewelry merchant from San Francisco,  was prosecuted for the sale of thirteen $20 gold coins without a  license. Secret Service agents discovered the sale with the help of the  buyer. Farber, his father, and 12 others were arrested in four American  cities after a [sting operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation)  conducted by the United States Secret Service. The arrests took place  simultaneously in New York and three California cities, San Francisco,  San Jose, and Oakland. Morris Anolik was arrested in New York with  $5,000 in U.S. and foreign gold coins; Dan Levin and Edward Friedman of  San Jose were arrested with $15,000 in gold; Sam Nankin was arrested in  Oakland; in San Francisco, nine men were arrested on charges of hoarding  gold. In all, $24,000 in gold was seized by Secret Service Agents  during the operation.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-12) 

David Baraban and his son Jacob Baraban owned a refining company.  The Barabans' license to deal in unmelted scrap gold was revoked, so  the Barabans operated their refining business under a license issued to a  Minnie Sarch. The Barabans admitted that Minnie Sarch had nothing to do  with the business, and that she had obtained the license so that the  Barabans could continue to deal in gold. The Barabans had a cigar box  full of gold-filled scrap jewelry visible in one of the showcases.  Government agents raided the Barabans' business and found another hidden  box of U.S. and foreign gold coins. The coins were seized and Baraban  was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-13) 

Louis Ruffino was one individual who was indicted on three counts purporting to violations of the [Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917), which restricted trade with countries hostile to the United States. Eventually, Ruffino appealed[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-14)  the conviction to the Circuit Court of Appeals 9th District in 1940;  however, the judgment of the lower courts was upheld based on the  President's executive orders and the [Gold Reserve Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act_of_1934).  Ruffino, a resident of Sutter Creek in California-gold country, was  convicted of possessing 78 ounces of gold and was sentenced to 6 months  in jail, paid a $500 fine, and had his gold seized.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-15) 

Foreigners also had gold confiscated, and were forced to accept  paper money for their gold. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, a Swiss  banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins for business use. The  Uebersee Finanz-Korporation entrusted the gold to an American firm for  safekeeping, and the Swiss were shocked to find that their gold was  confiscated. The Swiss made appeals, but those appeals were denied; they  were entitled to paper money, but not their gold. The Swiss company  would have lost 40% of their gold's value if they had tried to buy the  same amount of gold with the paper money they received in exchange for  their confiscated gold.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#cite_note-16)

"You *really* wanna be pedantic about the definition? Because I can be absolutely be pedantic about the definition:


>In Marxist theory, socialism (also called the socialist mode of production) refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that supersede capitalism in the schema of historical materialism. The Marxist definition of socialism is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is use-value and therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning, while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of to each according to his contribution. The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood, either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and self-management, so that the social surplus accrues to the working class and society as a whole.

>This view is consistent with, and helped to inform, early conceptions of socialism where the law of value no longer directs economic activity, and thus monetary relations in the form of exchange-value, profit, interest and wage labor would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.

That there is pretty much the purest definition you can get short of using the original German, and I'll tell you right now that the [law of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_value) was most *certainly* not superseded by [use-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value) in the Venezuelan economy. 

Had that been so, then they wouldn't have been hit nearly as hard by [Dutch disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease), which literally anyone who's understanding of economics wasn't built on internet memes can tell you was *easily* the single largest driving force behind the state of their economy today.

Actually dollar cost averaging is just a way to ease people into the market without triggering their psychological fears of investing. Time in the market beats timing the market.

"Self defense laws don't allow you to shoot someone because they're stealing your property.  That's considered manslaughter or murder depending on the circumstances.  

&#x200B;

Self defense laws such as Castle Doctrine or Stand Your Ground allow you to defend yourself with lethal force when there is reasonable cause to believe that an assailant is attempting to end your life.  Meaning, if you come at me with a knife, or a pipe, or some sort of tool that will aid you in administering deadly force then I would be justified (maybe) in using a firearm to neutralize my assailant if I am unable to escape the situation by non-violent methods.  

&#x200B;

At the end of the confrontation I'm probably still going to get arrested and go to jail.  I'll (probably) have to go to court and present a case proving that the shooting was justified.  Even if a jury finds that the shooting was justified and I'm cleared of any legal repercussions, I can still be sued in civil court by the assailant's family.  

&#x200B;

"What you think of the source is immaterial. All of the pertinent facts in the article I linked are accurate. Even your own source acknowledges that in fact there was no ban (since a self-imposed ban is not a ban.) Here's [another source][1], an article written by a former CDC doctor and published by Public Radio International, titled ""I worked at the CDC and if it really wanted to, it could study gun violence."" The writer says:

> I was a public health doctor at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many believe the CDC is banned from studying guns — [but that's not exactly true.][2]

The author links to another piece titled ""CDC isn’t banned from studying gun violence; it’s just too scared to do its job.""

Really the complaint regarding Congress in your source seems to come down to the fact that Congress isn't earmarking funds explicitly for research on gun violence. That's a pretty weak complaint and a far cry from the alleged ban. Looking at 2018's HR 1625, I see of the funds allocated to the CDC $173 million that could go to research on injury prevention and control, which could cover gun violence. If the Pentagon can ""lose"" $21 trillion from 1998 to 2015 then surely the CDC could find a way to funnel a few million from its $5.6 billion budget to research on guns.

1. The assessed value is usually low as it's not vigorously raised unless the house is sold, there are several exemptions that limit the tax, including homestead. So while the gross rate might be high the actual paid amount isnt.

2. The State property tax, isn't the whole picture. Schools have a separate tax that varies by district, and there is a surcharge to support schools in poorer districts.

3. County, and city, and utilities also are funded by property taxes. The upside is your property tax is the ONE tax you pay, the downside is it is a sizable tax.
