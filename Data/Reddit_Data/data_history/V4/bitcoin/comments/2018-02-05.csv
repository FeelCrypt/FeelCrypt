"Doesn't matter what you took, I'm just speaking to the level of economic understanding displayed here. I'm not the first to point out the deflation problem of Bitcoin, and most Bitcoiners have moved on to arguing that it's a ""store of value"" now that the ""deflation is good, mkay"" viewpoint has largely been put to bed.

You're assuming something that won't happen, given the nature of the beast - it won't stabilize when the majority are speculators and there's no other reason to buy into it. What would create stability in the market? 

I'll assume (just for fun) deflation becomes stable at 2%. What happens then is people take advantage of the risk-less arbitrage opportunity of a 4-5% net return by buying and holding Bitcoin. There's fundamentally no winning a currency battle when holding offers you more benefits than trading. 

I'm not sure what philosophical angle you expect me to buy into, but saying it has anything to do with ""humans main purpose"" isn't an economic argument. Not everyone has to be expected to ""hoard"", but if an arbitrage opportunity exists you can damn well bet people will take advantage of it.";1;0;False;Azara1th;dtqx58f;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

"I had economics in university. please stop condescending.

assuming bitcoin gets wide spread its value will stabalize as the speculativ trade volumes will decrease in comparison to purchase transactions. stable value means let's say a deflation of 2%.

the assumption people won't spend and instead hoard everything above their basic needs is a fallacy because it implies that humans main purpose is to accumulate money. at least I wouldn't give up on my vacations for the sake of accumulating 2% more money. inflation just pushes people to spend more than they actually need.

bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were designed to be used as a decentralized means of exchange, not a store of value. If you actually believe in the technology behind cryptocurrencies, then you'd realize that the current value of cryptos far exceeds its purported utility. The value is supported by pure speculation. Bitcoin means nothing and has no value if no one is buying anything in cryptocurrency. So few vendors actually take it. And why would you spend it if you think its value is increasing? And why would a vendor take it if its value can decrease overnight? Volatility is not a desirable trait in currency. Crypto as it is now discourages people from spending it and using it for its intended purpose. Anonymity and decentralization's not enough of an incentive for the majority of people to switch from traditional currencies. As it is, someone is going to be left holding a bag of shit just like any other hype based pump and dump schemes.;1;0;False;plaregold;dtsj91c;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

The interesting thing about this bitcoin phenomenon is that it's an instrument based PURELY on supply and demand with absolutely nothing else behind it.(the true definition of a pyramid scheme)  Bitcoin does nothing. Don't tell me its a currency, it's too volatile for that. Governments aren't going to sit by while we create a secret bank account for everyone.

It was a legal hit though. The runner should have been looking where he was going. He ran into the defensive player too. He was trying to be clever and juke people and got nailed for it.

"""back on track"" ... don't make me laugh.  

The problem is too many of you people have begun to equate BTC's *value* with its *dollar* value.  The BTC ecosystem for regular payments is still tiny.  It's nowhere near ubiquitous.    

All crypto is hobbled as long as you even give a shit what it's dollar value is on a day to day basis.  You are owned by the banks, then.  You've been bought off.  Your gains are paid for by suckers chasing this thing even higher.  Not going to be too many more of them now.  Get ready for a real bloodbath and a fall back to parity with gold or lower...  

It's incredibly sad to see how this has turned out.  I was a miner back in 2010 thru 2015, when my GPU became useless.  Haven't done it since and sort of forgot about it when then dropped back below $800...  now I turn around and everyone's chasing appreciation instead of *using* BTC to buy non-illegal things, daily use stuff...damn near everyone who bought since the end of November has been bled white.

Sell while you can.  This isn't going to end well.

"That's not necessarily a good assumption. People have tried doing mining and all this just out of curiosity.
And most of the early adopters, miners are tech people who know nothing about economics and finance. And I m not saying this to hurt someone but this is something I have experienced last whole year when I tried to understand but couldn't find any convincing  arguments of why cryptos better for our economy compared to current Fiat money system.
I tried to read articles, watch YouTube videos etc.but all in can.

"Right. But that's a very shallow argument. I m not trying to support banksters and I love the tech behind cryptos. But I hate it when people are just hating the banks based on the perception created by media and just bcoz all others abusing the bankers, instead of understanding the reality.
I have asked this question on Reddit so many times but no crytpo enthusiast has been able to give  convincing reasons of why they hate bankers.

It seems they are not aware about how our economy runs, how Fiat money is accessible to everyone and how it helps maintain a balance, security etc.

Regarding 2008 crisis, only blaming the banks would be akin to blaming today's big tech companies 20-30 years later,  for failing to account the dangers of AI early on  which allowed  AI to start becoming a threat to humanity.
Or blaming the government for allowing companies to do AI research. Future generations will curse us just like we curse the govt today about how didn't we take enough measures and we're happily busy watching and creating AI win over our own humans.


These big events are result of large number of small events, govt policies etc that occured throughout the financial system over several years. I doubt any single bank would have been able to predict how their activities will not just create trouble for them but also for the entire US financial system. If they actually predicted, wouldn't themselves exited the business before bubble burst.
 And if govt shouldn't have bailed them out, should they have just let the entire financial system fail ?
Also if u watch documentaries such as inside job u will realize there were housing mortgage companies who actually started giving loans to people with no income. These are not wall street firms. Why not blame them as well ?

Also another interesting thing to note is that, most of these so called tech disrupters who hate wall street ultimately end up going to wall street banks to help them create their IPOs and sell their stocks to common public. Those founders and early employees become rich bcoz of selling their papers to the US public. And as u must have seen from popular app IPOs that came in last year, which are down significantly, why doesn't anyone question these tech founders ? Isn't the good hardworking US population bailing them out ? 



I just hope that we all try to better understand both the current financial system of Fiat money as well as about cryptos and make informed choices rather than being biased based on perceptions created by media.

"Oops, I did misreport the gambler’s fallacy, my bad and I appreciate the correction.

I haven’t done a lot of digging, but the claim that stock prices are random seems preposterous. 

My beginning research found https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/mean_reversion_martingale.asp

“The only conclusion that can be drawn is that there may be some momentum effects, in the short term, and a weak mean reversion effect, in the long term.”

While this didn’t report a strong effect, it seems to acknowledge that one was there, and even a weak effect is leveraged with a properly diversified portfolio.

Even a .5% correlation would be enough to make a wise investor money. That’s also all a card counter needs to beat the house.

Tai Lopez is a con-artist.  He offers nothing but the same thing everyone else already knows.  In fact he didn't come on the scene until long after Bitcoin started skyrocketing and saw that was the way to make his mark.

His wealth comes from offering courses  - not from anything he's done on his own.  So the charm is ""Look at me, I'm rich I have cars and two big mansions and you can be this way too if you get my courses.""  The thing is, he ONLY got that because of the courses offered.  

It's the oldest con game in the world.  First pretend to be rich, offer a course on getting rich and get rich from the courses.  If you have the gift to talk like you know something, you can do anything.

"What? Why are you talking about legacy and potential lawsuits?? Again with the slight that he rents the mansion? Where do you live, O Great Crypto Genius?? I 100% guarantee you Tai rented on purpose specifically to write it off on his taxes as a business expense. And of course you work in a university, your argument is burdened with debate fallacies. 
Dude, Tai offers so much free content and advice on his free podcast that it’s ridiculous. I love his talks, and you clearly DO NOT listen to Tai since the man has a huge boner for reading. He even straight up says you’re stupid if you don’t read and seek knowledge. 

You obviously don’t listen to Tai, why are you giving your ignorant opinions on him then? You’re just parroting other unfounded crap people say when they talk about him. Do I think his bitcoin class is cheesy? Of course, and I use this little awesome feature called Skip to gloss over ads. He has even said it himself, everything he offers in his paid courses are just condensed versions of what he pontificates on his regular free podcasts. You pay for the shortened convenience only if you’re a fool. Everything else is absolutely free. I’ve been listening to Tai Lopez for over a year now and have never spent a penny.

"It's actually not uncommon for wealthy individuals to rent homes and lease cars.  Buying home requires a huge amount of up front capital that could otherwise be tied up into income generating businesses.

I mean, I wouldn't argue one way or another, but the idea some will argue is if you have 20% available to put into a house, you're better off investing it into a rental property or some other business for passive income rather than tieing it up into a long term liability like a house where only taxes and interest could potentially be itemized.

Again, Im not arguing one is right or wrong and I prefer owning a house and paying it off eventually even as someone who owns investment properties, but there's a huge sector of the high net worth population that believes there are better uses for capital than ownership of property and cars, but will lease those same items as desired.";7;1;False;ElscottHavoc;dtqp1nu;We need to talk about Tai Lopez;7v7fgl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7fgl/we_need_to_talk_about_tai_lopez/

If your definition of a scammer is someone who sells information that can be obtained for free, then I have news for you: ANY information can be obtained for free these days. It's called Google, YouTube, and the other platforms you named. Books offer information that can be obtained for free. College courses offer information that can be obtained for free. 

Instead of hating on him, LEARN from what he is doing to reach the masses, market himself, and make sales.
