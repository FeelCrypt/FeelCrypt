"You've no idea what you're talking about. (starting with you're style of argument)

Where am I backtracking?

>Imagine if everyone sold their crypto today, 400 billion will never be extracted from this market. That mtgox custodian guy sold 0.2% of all coins and crashed the market 70%, total money extracted was less than $20million.

But everyone will not sell all their crypto in one go so it's a silly hypothesis. Anyway coins can be auctioned or sold face to face without anyone knowing and not affect the market.

Right, I'm sure they are not worried about crypto. Just as the music industry wasn't worried about Napster and Pirate Bay. They are fools if they are not concerned.

The crypto market is just starting. There's nothing technically to stop it going to trillions.

Of course they are! A judge would order you to compensate the damaged party with a value equal to the damages at the time of the court judgement. For example, if you bought a model T ford in 1920 and in 2018 someone crashed into your pristine model T, they'd be paying a shitton more than the $850 it cost to buy that car originally.

"> Do you go to prison if you don't play at the arcade?

Not really relevant. While being forced to pay your taxes in dollars would provide some buy pressure (or hodl pressure), the government's pretty-much immediate spending of that money is basically sell pressure that perfectly balances it out. The value of a currency cannot come from having to use it in transitory interaction. Just like a token has no value, its the games that have value. Likewise its not the tax paying tokens that has value, its the government that has value (even if you disagree that value matches what you're paying for it).
