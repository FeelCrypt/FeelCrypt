"My point is that ""market/user consensus"" is the actual decider when it comes to questions about things like ""realness,"" proper names, the assignment of ticker symbols, etc. There is no such thing as ""network consensus"" on questions like that, because those aren't attributes assigned by the protocol or transactions committed to the blockchain.

It's true that a more valuable network is likely to show more accumulated difficulty, but that's an *effect*, not a cause. It would make exactly as much sense to just look at the price and decide based on that--which is arguably how exchanges and other blockchain businesses make these decisions in actual practice.

So how is ""market/user consensus"" achieved in the first place? As I've already pointed out, it emerges from public discourse, institutional inertia, and various other forces that work to shape and sway popular opinion.

That answer doesn't sit well with a lot of people in this community, because we'd all prefer to believe that everything about Bitcoin is apolitical, self-regulated, and governed exclusively by immutable rules, but I think it's important to be honest about this.

"**Merkle tree**

In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains.

Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of a given binary hash tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the logarithm of the number of leaf nodes of the tree; this contrasts with hash lists, where the number is proportional to the number of leaf nodes itself.

"OP confused INTRINSIC (belonging naturally; essential.)

They are not the same thing, at all. The intrinsic nature, as opposed to extrinsic, refers to logical ordering. If X then always necessarily Y.

Inherent refers to characteristics that one way or another become necessary.

**So people arguing that ""the US Dollar doesn't have inherent value"" are wrong. What the US Dollar doesn't have is INTRINSIC value.** 

Of course the US Dollar has inherent value: it has been imbued with value, necessarily, by being the currency of the US. That's why it is money and not merely currency.

It isn't INTRINSIC value, because tomorrow the inherent value of the us dollar could be 0.0001$

"**now the comfortable truths:**

1. Bitcoin actually HAS inherent value, unlike FIAT money. FIAT money is issued depending on what the central banks think is needed to stabilize our wholey monetary system. It is not limited. And there is no inherent value to be found in cash. It is simply the trust and consensus in our society that we decide that on.

However, Bitcoin is not just limited in supply, it is also expensive to ""produce"" What are the costs for mining 1 bitcoin? like 2000 dollars? That could be seen as inherent value. 

2. Bitcoin is used by criminals? Jesus christ. There are legit statistics from governments(!) tell us that like 4% of illicit activities are paid in cryptocurrencies. Guess what is the rest: Cash, predominantly.

Nothing is as anonym and intransparent as cash.
Now, from the 4% I would imagine only a small portion is actually Bitcoin and the rest is private shit like Monero and ZCash. Bitcoin is amazing for the authorities. It's transparent. ";1;1;False;RidingTheRide;dyfg22d;Uncomfortable truths!!;8gt06k;https://i.redd.it/jcww4yxkyov01.jpg

"What is gold other than a shiny piece of metal? Of course, so long as there are humans who put a ton of value on shiny pieces of metal, it will be valuable. However, for critically minded individuals, gold is also only subjectively valuable. 

One can then counter by saying it has industrial applications, but other metals may be swappable for gold as well, so unless there are gold-exclusive properties (I’m not a material science major so don’t ask me) such that ONLY gold can be used for a specific USEFUL task/function (I personally haven’t heard of any), you can’t say gold is so intrinsically valuable that it will, guaranteed, forever be strong enough to use a backup for a currency. 

Even if gold was/is used to backup fiat, if you think about it, the same thing could even be applied to crypto if it catches on. Humans just have to agree to it. Crypto, like anything, can be backed by anything, even if that something isn’t gold. Fiat only exists on a different level than crypto when there is government intervention and mandatory usage by force. But crypto also has its own level of force via its insanely large support base of people. So I guess we’ll see what happens in the end. It’s definitely an interesting time.

It means that no matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter when you are, something that is inherently X always has the quality of X.  But clearly there are plenty of individuals who find absolutely no value to 1 US, Canadian, Australian, or 30-something other countries that have currencies named ""dollars"", even amongst humans.  This is especially true when the currencies are digital, as most modern monetary systems are (physical cash isn't used in most monetary exchanges).

Although your arguments are correct I don't agree that it's a useless metric. It's representing the total value of all the circulating supply. Price is always moving based on supply and demand. If everyone wants to sell, then there will probably be more supply than demand, so prices will drop.
