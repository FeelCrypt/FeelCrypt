"What? Im so confused. Is that socialism? China has government influenced economic policies but its less socialism and more federalism. Sorta.

"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp

> A store of value is any form of wealth that **maintains its value without depreciating**. Commodities such as gold and other forms of metal are good stores of value, as their shelf lives are essentially perpetual, whereas a good such as milk is a terrible store of value due to its natural process of spoilage. Interest-bearing assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, are very good stores of value, because they generate an income of their own and their principal value is backed by a legal contract.

Again, historically it is not a good store of value.  *Obviously* USD is a *reasonable* **short-term** store of value (otherwise people wouldn't use it).  But they intentionally build in inflation to *reduce* its store of value to encourage people to get out of it and into other commodities (which is presumed to build the economy), which makes it *historically* a bad store of value. 

A good store of value doesn't lose value over time.

Having no inflation would [seriously raise unemployment](https://www.brookings.edu/research/low-inflation-or-no-inflation-should-the-federal-reserve-pursue-complete-price-stability/) because lowering wages is difficult, but not raising to account for modest price increases is easy. 2% a year loss of value by design is also much more desirable than double digit percent changes weekly.;4;1;False;nicethingscostmoney;e2zryg7;Love reading LinkedIn idiots.;91ad3y;https://i.redd.it/p9wb3dm46rb11.png
