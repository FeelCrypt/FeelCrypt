"Many comparisons to bitcoin businesses can be drawn.  Their recent clashes with TFL in London are an example of New World businesses thinking they can come in with tech and smash down the doors on old world companies that have been operating for decades (and with it all the accrued safety checks, balances, jobs and procedures that revolve around paper-belt pen and ink).  

Both worlds need to come together for all this to work without friction and truly set us all free...  And we see progress and concessions being made on both sides to that end (Black Cabs in London must very soon by Law include the ability for customers to pay by card instead of cash for instance).

I hope UBER win their appeal, but on the proviso they make a bunch of concessions that embrace some of those old ways that have been established for good reason.  Giving Black Cabs access to UBER tech for Free would be one step in the right direction.

If they don't, another app will come along that does and all those UBER drivers will migrate, since the free-market need for UBER amongst a younger more tech savvy demographic will remain.   

Same goes for bitcoin businesses that don't give a shit about finance companies in that old word (and people with livelihoods relying on them) they seek to disrupt.

"Ooooo I can answer that (being an impartial investor in both)!

Litecoin is worth much less per coin, so any positive fluctuation in price is a huge gain, and any negative fluctuation is not as bad.


That is to say, let's say I bought 2 bitcoins.  I spend $7000.  The price goes up $200.  Cool.  I just made $400. 

Ok, let's say I bought $7000 worth of $50 bitcoin. That's like 150ish coins (estimate in my head).  Let's say my coins went up only $100 instead of $200.  So 150 coins times $150 = $22500.  Despite only going up half as much as bitcoin.

"Yes exactly.  In fact, BlahBlah car already established this and it works brilliantly (used it myself a number of times all over Europe).  Same with Couchsurfing vs. AirBnB.

In terms of land re-use, the JustPark app represents Car Parking without Gatekeepers (anyone with a space can list it and set their own price).

https://www.justpark.com/

This opens up an interesting new way of managing resources whereby anyone not making efficient use of their land and resources - and getting paid for it! (be that car parking, spare houses, boats, lawnmowers etc.) without good reason would see a net social capital and monetary deficit... Such a system would incentivise them to share those unused resources with the wider community. 

Car use itself: we're not far away now from smart locks backed by a smart contract that allows any good actor to simply use a car or bike when the owner makes it available.  The majority of cars sit there unused for most of their lives (think of the dead time they spend 9-5 in the workplace car park for instance).

In years to come I'm quite sure we will all be asking ""Can you believe EVERYONE on the street used to own their own lawnmower which they only used an hour every 2 months?  Madness!""

Imagine if each device (like a lawnmower, car) had an integrated smart chip in the plug / ignition that measured use so that individuals and communities could figure out where resource usage waste was happening and re-route those resources to where they were needed... This works for people energy too (Opens App: I need a lawnmower AND someone to mow my lawn - bam, old guy down the road who spends most of the day inside, meets his neighbour for the first time, mows their lawn, makes money and strengthens community bonds through getting to know their neighbour).

"Think of UBER as a stepping stone to something much better in the Web 3.0 decentralised future.  The system they have built, much like with AirBnB, if we were to imagine it 10 years ago, we would say, impossible.  The checks, balances, algos they have in place for measuring trust and establishing a free-market taxi economy are easily transferred to blockchain.  As sure as all the work on Google Maps (cafe, business ratings etc.) are transferrable and measurable on a global, immutable ledger.

UBER's recent change in CEO (a bitcoin believer) should also see them embracing all this in some really exciting ways we've yet imagined as they open up the platform with API's that allow for all kinds of cool open source experiments (including old world cab companies themselves integrating UBER tech-based solutions), much like we're seeing Banking apps exposing their data via API's.

"I did respond. You just babble on about what you think would happen, but you state it as fact. 

Why am I paying a tax that I never agreed to, that has and continues to kill millions of innocent people? (20-30 million killed by us in 37 countries since ww2, wonder why we need protection/military spending/why the entire world hates us?) Why has my government decided they are the world police?

"Anything anyone says about the future is what they think would happen... Nothing about the future can ever be a fact, just low probability.

If you replace personal income tax with corporate income tax, you'd have to quadruple corporate income tax to make up the difference. How could you think that's going to result in some companies just taking the hit, paying their employees the same amount, and offering products for the same prices? And people will drop any company that doesn't and go to the ones who do? It's just financially impossible. Companies would crumble if they tried that. Prices would rise and wages would drop, it's inevitable. How could you think that would benefit the middle class and result in the rich paying more taxes?

In regards to how we spend the taxes, maybe you need to run for office so you can change things or convince people to vote for different candidates who promise to make those changes. You may need to change how you discuss things with people though instead of alienating them by calling them ""kid"" or a coward and saying their views are garbage. Or you need to live in a different country. You're paying the tax because you live here and benefit from government spending.";1;1;False;LegitosaurusRex;dnc07mq;US bill has been made to remove taxes from BTC transactions under $600;70jw8b;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/u-s-bill-would-ease-bitcoin-tax-regulations-for-small-transactions/
"Increase corporate tax, decrease military and government spending.  These are general ideas, not concrete plans. 

Vote for a different candidate? Hahahahaha. One of the 2 false choices they spoon feed us? Good one.

And what benefits do you speak of?  

Live in another country? I would still owe taxes. I was born into it. They have my ass for life. Yours too. Wake up.

">Increase corporate tax, decrease military and government spending.

Sure, that sounds more reasonable than your ""Income tax is theft"" statement that started this argument. Though I will say I'm pretty certain that if you shift the tax burden away from income tax and towards corporate tax, it'll benefit the rich more than the poor or the middle class.

>Vote for a different candidate? Hahahahaha.

Obviously neither of those, though the Democrats typically want less military spending and more corporate taxes than the Republicans do. But there are other candidates in the primaries who may share your views as well as other parties; you'd have to convince people to vote for them, which would obviously be difficult even if everyone shared your views. The first step would probably be getting economists to agree that your plan would help the middle class, but I think they'd tell you what I did.

>Live in another country? I would still owe taxes.

Not if you get citizenship in that country and revoke your American citizenship, which is what I meant... It's not for life, it's for as long as you're a citizen of the US and therefore enjoying the benefits of your tax dollars...

> And what benefits do you speak of?

"Right, my points are so garbage you don't have any responses to them.

Quote me where I said things are fine the way they are. As I keep saying, our government is better than no government but can still be improved, and getting rid of income tax won't fix the current problems.

There wouldn't be employment elsewhere or different cheaper products if every single corporation was taxed the same!! They're already selling their products at a price which keeps them as competitive as necessary and protects their profit margins. Any company that could reduce its profit margin to gain market share would already have done so before the tax happened. 

The only exception would be if foreign products don't get hit by this tax, in which case, good job, you managed to kill what was left of American goods production and accelerated the outsourcing of services as well, that'll be great for the economy. And I pointed out the issue of monopolies in a free market; we can already see the effects of the effective monopolies we currently have. How many people like data caps on internet usage, but can't vote with their wallets because there aren't any comparable alternatives?

Taxation isn't modern-day slavery dude... And calling me a coward and telling me to gtfo off of a public forum?

crypto will be the most disruptive technology ever created.  Governments won't be able to get any legislation in place to control it before it changes.  They won't be able to regulate it.  The only thing they will be able to do is what China did unfortunately.;1;0;False;realslimcheney;dncuheh;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now. Bankers begin to panic.
