What you are describing is ""sunk cost"", not opportunity cost. The retrospective analysis of a choice in one of two options in the same instrument (ie: to sell/hold or to buy/not) is sunk cost in the first example and a simple decision on the second. 

The option to choose an alternative instrument or investment, and the potential outcome of that investment relative to the one you chose is opportunity cost.

"I haven't switched what I said. I've always been talking about opportunity cost. If you have a finance degree, I have to admit there's a decent chance I'm missing something basic here, but you haven't shown me what it is anywhere.

So let me lay this out as clear as I can:

I am defining cost as both actual cost and opportunity cost, because I see them as the same thing for the purposes of evaluating a single investing decision where outside factors are equal.

The cost of *holding* 1 BTC when it was $20k instead of *selling* is, as of today, $11.5k.

The cost of *buying* 1 BTC when it was $20k instead of *not buying*, is as of today $11.5k.
