In the short term no. In the long term absolutely yes.  Why? Because the whole crypto market cap is a laughable 100 billion.  You know what the 'market cap' of the internet would be if it theoretically had one? Probably in the hundreds of trillions.  The brand for monster energy drink is worth over 20 billion...... that's a single soft drink company....  And yes I believe the advent of cryptocurrency as a protocol is as impactful as the Advent of http and tcp/ip (internet) protocols.

Maybe the piece I'm missing is where that $70+k came from?  Did he rent it out from day 1, so that every single payment came straight out of the rent?
