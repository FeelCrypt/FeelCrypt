Bitcoin does do quite a few things that fiat isn't able to. It is trustless, so you are not exposed to counterparty risk. It is decentralised, borderless and censorship resistant, meaning you are not subject to government's monetary policy. Look at Greece as a place where citizens were screwed by the government when the economy faulted. It is inherently deflationary and can be used to store value, something that is important in an environment with hyper-inflation, see: Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I think fiat is important and it's not going anywhere, but there is definitely value in crypto - how much valuation it should have I think is the question.;2;0;False;ArcaneTekka;dsci0i7;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

Segwit was not compatible with old wallets. Because they couldn’t just invalidate everyone’s current wallets and transactions, segwit was made optional with its own type of address. It has to be supported forever because legacy addresses will always exist and it would be pretty shitty if all of the sudden they could transact on the network. So segwit is inherently optional, and some of the biggest exchanges (like Coinbase) still don’t use it. There are also a lot of mining nodes not running segwit as well.

Obviously the experience doesn't match what everyone says. For some reason, the transaction keeps getting broadcast. Instead of everyone saying that it should drop in 2 weeks, perhaps someone should explain what's going on? My guess is nobody really knows except for the bitcoin developers or wallet developers. Clearly, there needs to be better mechanisms for unconfirmed transactions. Ideally, they should drop off in a few hours if they don't confirm, not 2 weeks. ;1;1;False;Niku-Man;dscxpwr;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

This is also true of bitcoin mining.   There is no difference here in centralization.

And yes, I do expect that the more highly regulated networks will be cheaper.   But this is the same for Bitcoin mining which can also be used for ""weak censorship-at-a-cost"".   Again, lightning is no different.

"> The Network should remove unconfirmed transaction from the mempool after 14 days.

This misunderstands the details.

An individual full node would indeed invalidate the TX after some time. But your wallet keeps on broadcasting the transaction and so any new node being started up somewhere in the world can end up with your transaction again. For 2 weeks.
Not to mention people actively re-broadcasting their mempool. Yes, they definitely exist.

Okay I just read it and wonder how much weight they were putting into the recent loss of nodes at the time.  This was from Sept 2015. I'm not sure why but there was a huge spike loss of nodes right around the time this was written.  .500KB blocks started becoming common in July.  Even after reading that paper thoroughly I'm not sure where your 90% loss of nodes estimate came from. Going by that logic you should be terrified that the entire Bitcoin network would start using Segwit all at once.  Depending on exactly where you believe the bottleneck to be you're either looking at 4MB/block of bandwidth and memory or 2MB or storage space.

"> 20% daily swings are not.

When you're starting from effectively ""no value,"" though, I am going to disagree with that.  The market hasn't yet found the value of this thing, and as yet hasn't encountered a commodity like it.  As a result of that, I don't think 20% swings in value are all that surprising.  They're not great, but until the market comes to a greater consensus on what this shit is worth, they will happen from time to time - and the market will *not* come to a greater consensus on what it's worth, until we have greater society-wide adoption.  We won't have greater society-wide adoption without low transaction fees and times.

>BTC is not a ""store of value"", key word being store. It does however ""have"" value. The difference between these 2 is incredibly important. I'm not going to try to convince you of this, because it is in your own interest to understand why this is.

I understand the distinction between those two.  However, if you create a new store of value, you have to convince people that it's a good store of value *before* it's going to have any value.  That's what Bitcoin is doing.  I'm convinced Bitcoin's value lies between $100,000 and $1,000,000, and so, it will have some days where it climbs 20% to get there.  It *has* to in order to get there.  It's *going* to be unstable as long as it remains the niche of investors and hodlers, it won't stabilize until *everyone* is using it to transact.";1;0;False;the_calibre_cat;dscgmaj;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

"The thing is: They are not cheap nor fast. Bank transfers take a couple of days to actually reach your account and payment systems like paypal or amazon also [cost a percentage](https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-are-the-fees-for-paypal-accounts-faq690/8) of the price.

The difference to Bitcoin is that the fees and the transaction time is only noticeable for the seller, not the buyer. (Transaction time when the seller tries to withdraw the money to their bank account or doesn't get paid until the end of the month depending on the plattform)

If sellers would start directly accepting crypto currency payments instead of relying on non-trustless payment processors that mimicking paypal (e.g. by selling on OpenBazaar) then the prices for Bitcoin purchases could actually be lower as the seller almost instantly receives 100% of the price. (Obviously this would require a more stable Bitcoin to USD exchange rate)

Exchange fees? Isn't that normal. And shouldn't you compare with forex not stocks? Your Bitcoin returns are more likely to be far greater anyway.

Bitcoin is a money just as gold is. It's not a very good currency. Not yet anyway. Currencies should not have a finite supply. Not sure what Satoshi was thinking there.

I agree with simply block-size increase we go back to the same problem again once that block-size is fully utilized. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't use this solution ever. We cannot increase block-size to 1gb. But we sure as hell can increase it to 16mb or even 32mb and be okay for few years. And this few years allows us time to  develop LN and other solution. So hopefully we won't encounter this situation ever again. Right now we are being choked to death. If bitcoin falls behind bcash, I fear there won't be any recovering from it. It would be a huge psychological defeat. And guess what if bcash adopts LN, it would be certain death for bitcoin. We need real tangible solution right now.

"I'm not complaining, I'm not sure what language you're inferring that from. I am saying, however, without the exchange, Bitcoin isn't even a good ""store"" of value. Anything that regularly drops or rises 20% in a day isn't a ""store"", you could say it ""has"" value, and that'd be accurate, but qualifying it as a good ""store"" of value is not accurate. For something to act economically as a good ""store"" of value, it needs to have a high degree of predictability.

Clearly you do not understand segwit. Even having a segwit address reduces the total fee you pay because your transaction size decreases from 1/2 to 1/4 of what it was originally. When everyone has segwit though, the fees drop even more because the overall size of the mempool drops, which, by basic laws of supply and demand, means that sat/B fees drop as well because their is less competition for mempool space.;4;1;False;greyhoundfd;dscuigc;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

"Distributed ledgers have been around for a while. Basically a public key allows read only and a private key allows changes to be made. The private keys have been controlled by a central authority though. The breakthrough of bitcoin's blockchain is that it provides equal opportunity. Anyone with the knowledge and an internet (also not centralised) connection can use it. 

The blockchain alone is revolutionary but it was build as a core component of Bitcoin. A currency isn't only the most common application, it's the most liberating.  
If there is one central authority you rely on for money and it can send men with guns to your house to put you in chain and throw you in a cage; it is wage slavery.

"I'm not a Bitcoin Cash fan - they have a right to their technical differences but, quite frankly, I have a *really* hard time trusting a.) the kingpin of the current mining monopoly and b.) Roger Ver, who's paid people to issue favorable reviews of his currency and negative opinions about his competitors.  They seem really, really scummy, and I trust that scummy people tend to stick around scummy people.  I truly just do not trust the leading people behind Bitcoin Cash as far as I could throw a stone.

But.

If Bitcoin is to survive and not hemorrhage the value it's built up, then, in my view, two things need to happen:

1. There must be a reasonable blocksize increase immediately.  Honoring the New York Agreement (2MB hard limit, community agreements up to 4MB) would be the best way to do this.  Hell, it'd probably cause a pretty significant devaluation in Bitcoin Cash, as people return to Bitcoin, although that's not the goal.  This would give Bitcoin the liquidity it needs until Lightning is developed, without delving into the insanity of 1+GB blocks that the crazy people behind Bitcoin Cash are unironically talking about.

2. Lightning Network must not only be completed and functional on the blockchain within 2018, it must *also* have an easy-to-use U.I. **within Bitcoin Core**.  A user should be able to fire up Core, click ""Create Lightning payment channel"" (or something), and instantly make a payment channel with a willing participant, across which Bitcoin can be sent and received.

Without these, the Bitcoin experiment ends.  Sidechains aren't bad, in fact, they're arguably the best way to preserve decentralization, but we cannot spend 2018 losing what we have worked so hard to build.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  First mover advantage is ours, and I've been persuaded by some arguments that at least *SOME* kind of a blocksize increase isn't the death knell to decentralization that it's been made out to be.

"after the last 2017 BTC explosion I had thousands of dollars worth of BTC as a result of an investment amount that was pretty insignificant to me.

The last thing I need is a bigger tax bill, so I decided try and buy some stuff with it.  I found out that Newegg.com accepted bitcoin, so I got a ps4 pro, Xbox one x, battlefield 2, a high end sound bar /subwoofer, a pair of senheiser hd1s and a 2tb solid state drive.  But I’ll never buy anything with BTC again, because retailers are scum bags and don’t treat BTC as currency.

Several times, I would pay the exact amount that Newegg asked for, then I’d get my order cancelled for “underpayment”, because the value of BTC in USD went down a little....and god forbid if her majesty Newegg.com lose a few bucks...so instead they cancel the transaction, leaving me on the hook for the fees...and then the additional fees for the refund transaction.

Fuck this.

if you’re going to accept BTC, then fucking accept it, just as you would accept cash.  When i buy something from amazon, amazon doesn’t check the value of the US dollar against the yen or euro, and then cancel my order if the value falls a little.  Who cares what the value in USD is? Dollars werent the agreement upon payment method...BTC was.  If you ask for .00023 BTC, and I give that amount to you, then the transaction is OVER.  PERIOD.

Newegg has never given me a cash refund for “over payment” when the price of BTC goes up during the transaction.  Merchants accepting bitcoin shift all the risk of trading BTC on the customer, and if the transaction fails, then the customer is out a lot of money.

"I'm saying that your objection to the swinging *value* of Bitcoin being it's problem is like, nonsensical.  Objecting to that might as well be objecting to crypto generally, since *we don't know what its value is or will be*.  Could be $5,000 per BTC, could be $240,000 per BTC - I don't know!  I *DO* know, however, that your assumption that it's not a good store of value because it ""changes"" value, effectively renders anything *but* the dollar to be a ""good"" store of value - since any new store of value would have to start near $0 and climb its way to its honest market value, which, you know, is a pretty significant change in value and that's not predictable at all!

I'm not saying that transaction fees and transaction times aren't a problem, they absolutely are - but that's a problem that can be directly addressed by software.  Complaining about swings of 20% value in a day, on the other hand, is tantamount to complaining about the volatility of stocks, which can do the same thing.  It's part of the damn game, at least, *certainly* at this point, where crypto adoption and use isn't nearly as widespread as the dollar.

Assuming it gets there (I'm quite confident it will), it *will* become stable, but the solution to that is a social process, not a software patch.

">But less secure. And other coins will have scaling problems.
Umm...  Bitcoin has a HUGE scaling problem right now.  So, I would not say that other coins will have scaling problems.  Their solutions have not been tested at the volume Bitcoin has, but at least they're trying.

>You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.

I'm not talking about buying a whole Bitcoin.  I'm saying of you have $1000 to invest in Bitcoin right now, or the stock market, you will pay less fees to buy stock right now than you will to buy Bitcoin.  AND, you profits will be totally determined by the time of day you buy Bitcoin.  If you buy in at 1:00 PM ,you could lose you shirt.  But 2:15 PM, and you made a 25% profit.

>You seem to think Bitcoin is a mere Paypal. These sites don't accept gold either.

Gold IS a store of value.  It is not a currency.  It's value is it's scarcity.  Bitcoin is a currency.  What gives it value is the fact that I used to be able to send 10 BTC to my family in Ukraine in under 10 minutes for pennies.  With that gone, the thing that gives it value is also gone.

What serious bug?  And why would it be a disaster?  You do know that Bitcoin originally had one developer.  Then others joined.

"The move and reasons are similar to Steam's decision to stop supporting Bitcoin transactions at the start of December 2017.

Steam cited ""high fees and volatility"" as the reason it stopped supporting Bitcoin payments.

Transactions fees have skyrocketed from a few cents a few years back to tens of dollars, making Bitcoin almost unusable for microtransactions, where some users end up paying a large percentage of the transaction total as a transaction fee.

For companies like Microsoft and Steam, Bitcoin's volatile price is also an issue because sudden and unforeseeable price drops may incur huge losses.

Microsoft does not allow users to buy products with Bitcoin directly but asks users to add a predetermined amount of dollars to their account balance, for which they can pay with Bitcoin

That transfer is still subject to transaction fees, and Microsoft may still lose the value of the Bitcoin funds it received in its account, something that any financial department will have an issue with.

Bitcoin's price fluctuation is causing problems
Wile Bitcoin price has always fluctuated, it never swung like it did in the past three months. To be widely adopted by the financial sector, a digital or fiat currency must be stable in order to be useful, something that Bitcoin is definitely not.

In the meantime, Microsoft is advising customers to use other methods of payment, such as credit or debit cards, PayPal accounts, or a direct bank account.

Also this week, Visa terminated its agreement with WaveCrest, a prepaid card issuer, shutting down hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin debit cards issued by Bitwala, BitPay, Cryptopay, and others.


Microsoft has stopped supporting Bitcoin as a payment method for Microsoft products, Bleeping Computer has learned.

A Microsoft support staffer has told us the move is temporary and cited the unstable state of the Bitcoin currency. Microsoft added support for Bitcoin in 2014, and has previously temporarily stopped supporting Bitcoin in the past

>

That was the lie they repeated endlessly to get naive anarchists and libertarians onboard at the start. 

As the mining rewards go down, the network has to start charging fees to confirm transactions, or else no transactions are going to go through and the entire pyramid collapses. 

So now, when you send money, you must attach a transaction fee to it. The transactions with the highest fees get processed first. The transactions with the lowest fees disappear forever and never get processed. 

Since Buttcoin was designed by a moron, it can only handle around 5 transactions a day, naturally making it so that you have to pay around $400 a transaction if you want your money to go anywhere anymore.

"It's really much worse, because the recipient will then receive $40 that they can't actually spend, because when they try to spend that input they'll have to pay a hefty fee as well, leaving them with $8 of actual utility from the $72 you paid.

One could even argue that that $8 utility isn't even there, because the person receiving your recipient's payment would also need to pay a fee to spend that input and if the fees are this high that $8 becomes entirely worthless.

If there aren't any low fee periods once in a frequent while for folks to consolidate UTXO's then this is going to make anything other than multi-thousand dollar payments pointless very soon.

"Except tulips could not and never have been capable of being used to facilitate party to party transactions globally without a middleman.  Bitcoin goes up for the same reasons any other currency goes up - scarcity, supply, and demand.  Way to understand the technology though.

Will there be another better coin that comes along that can sustain a much higher transaction volume than Bitcoin?  There already are coins like that.  The key is that Bitcoin is well established and has been for years so people know they can place a base level of trust in the technology.  Think of Bitcoin as Myspace back in the day.  It introduced something revolutionary and was the most dominant, trusted social networking site worldwide.  The only reason Facebook took over as king is because Myspace failed to innovate and instead sought revenue at the expense of innovation.  If Bitcoin does not find a specific niche like in large scale global transactions where it's technology is feasible, it will also have to innovate and grow or it will eventually die.  

The three factors mentioned early are what gives Bitcoin value in the first place and worldwide trust in it as an established store of value and as a currency are what cause the massive fluctuations.  If it can overcome the obstacles that reduce trust, it will remain the cryptocurrency standard globally and will continue to increase in value as demand increases.  It is very lilely, though, that another crypto will step in within a few years as the standard once it can prove itself trustworthy as well.  How that will effect Bitcoin will remain to be seen but one thing is certain: Tulips are in no way, shape, or form representative of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.";-6;0;False;wtfpwnkthx;dsceprf;Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin payments;7or2i6;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency-/

What's happening now is we are foregoing short term scaling for long term. Nothing is holding you back from using alts, which devs have chosen short term scaling.

Any p2p software does not scale well, theres been numerous research papers done on why. Scaling doesn't have an easy answer, it's non-trivial. We are currently faced with exponential growth, and alts are currently choosing a linear scaling solution. You know how that will work out in the future.

"I disagree. At this point developing the best medium of exchange should absolutely be the priority, and the fact btc people have deluded themselves on this regard is why I sold all my bitcoin 12 months ago. Storage of value is an important piece of the puzzle yes but EVERY COIN can pretty much do this effectively now. Now the focus within the crypto community has largely moved on to value of exchange and BTC folks are stuck in the Stone Age.

If you compare BTC with other top cryptocurrencies in terms of storage of value there's very little difference. Most utilize the blockchain to some extent, so now the only difference that is separating most of the coins is their ability to exchange value. So what justifies bitcoins current #1 spot in terms of marketcap if there are 99 coins identical in terms their storage of value but that are better, faster, and cheaper than BTC.

If you add on top of that the seemingly incapable ability of Bitcoin core to deliver on their promises than you have a recipe for disaster.

1. The path to the recipient needs to consist of channels with a lot of liquidity so when people transfer a larger amount of money the transaction can succeed.

2. If your counterparty commits an old state of your channel to the blockchain (where they had more money), you need to react quickly enough and commit a newer state to the network. If your software is offline, you will lose money. If you manage to do it, they will lose their portion of the channel's money, provided their share is not nil. The channel thus needs to be run and monitored by a machine which is online 100% of the time and has a lot of liquidity.

"I don't actively participate in /r/btc. I'm on your side when it comes to that sub. Too steeped in conspiracy theory and personal attacks for my taste. And I wish this sub would feature less of the same.

I've been a member of this sub since November 2013, under numerous user accounts. Not because I've been banned, but because I delete my accounts every 1 to 2 years [for privacy reasons](https://www.snoopsnoo.com).

With my present account, I've rallied for SegWit, tried to counter the lies Ver spouts, and enthusiastically followed developments in LN, side chains, MAST, and Schnorr signatures. I've even succumb to the us-vs-them temptation and joined in the crowds scolding Jihan for setting SegWit back to keep ASICBoost alive - or at least that was the theory. So I get it, but you need to chill.

In the last year (maybe two?), I've seen a massive increase in this extremist us-vs-them nonsense. I recognize your username because of it. You pull this move on a lot of people who I really don't think deserve it. And for those who do, you're not going to change their minds. Maybe you should consider a different strategy.

My recent pessimism about Bitcoin is not coming from /r/btc. It's coming from observing that the technology I spent an entire year waiting to activate, hoping that it would fix Bitcoin's scaling issues, has had very little noticeable impact, and sits at 10% adoption despite all the good it can do. Meanwhile, dozens of cryptos have been built from the ground up to more directly tackle the scaling problems that bitcoin more or less ignored until now. They have an edge over us because their solutions can afford to be more drastic, not opt-in. ETH did willy-nilly hard fork to undo the whole DAO mess, but they've put together a roadmap that fosters a culture of drastic change. That allows them a luxury of rapid innovation and makes things like the DAO ""fix"" less objectionable to their community. It's a different culture and it has its pros and cons.

It does not.  But it lowers fees and transaction times.  With lower fees and times, people are more likely to stay in the ecosystem.  If you, as a retailer can accept Bitcoin and then use that Bitcoin to buy goods from a wholesaler, who in turn uses those same Bitcoins to buy product from a manufacturer, who buys his raw parts in Bitcoin, then we'll see a price stabilization.  Until then, it's always going to be a rollercoaster.  We need to get Bitcoin used up and down the supply chain.  We were on our way to doing that until it became way to expensive to move Bitcoin.

>Segwit gave Bitcoin a safer block size increase.

Segwit made it safe to implement Lightning.  As a side benefit, it increased the block size through some magic that doesn't increase the block size.  And adoption of it has been piss pore.

The only way to get Bitcoin core devs to do something is for near-unanimous agreement among them that the BIP should be implemented.

You can literally look up charting figures for SNAP. You had to of lied on your application to receive more than what is set.

The max pell grant is less than 6k and can only have one out at a time over a 12 month period for an individual school. So again stop spewing bullshit because unless you're going to a community college that isn't going to cover an entire tuition, fees, books etc... of any bachelor program anywhere.

When you qualify for Medicaid you're also give resources for a list of people who accept it. You can't just go into some random doctors office and ask for service just because you have it. That 1 dollar copay is also bullshit. Just visit medicaid.gov and make yourself look like a complete spunkmouth. You have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.

And I’m sorry, but my family isn’t busting ass and working like crazy to give away more money than I keep for myself. Maybe it makes you feel superior, so keep feeling that.

You really should not include percentages in your comments, if you are unable to do basic math.

Also the point I wanted to make that the reason you pay +50% taxes and still live in great wealth, is most likely just because you were born into a much more privileged position. Its not because of your hard work that allows you to give and still live wealthy.

I am sorry but your post is filled with ignorance. That is likely because you have never actually studied or benefited from these programs yourself, rather you accept other peoples talking points as fact. The SNAP figure is based on my own experience receiving SNAP. If you have an EFC of 0, Pell grants are enough to pay the complete tuition, fees, and books bill at state colleges around the country. Medicaid has been in existence for decades. The only people who are poor and lack medical care are unwilling to apply. If you have Medicaid, something I have also had in the past, you are asked to pay a $1 copay for services/drugs and no monthly fee. But providers can not refuse to see you if you cant afford it. If you have money to afford these things, you don't get them for free. ;-1;1;False;andy378;dsdx3ev;Bitcoiners be like 😂;7oyba2;https://i.redd.it/srikkyu2cu801.jpg

The market cap doesn't reflect how much money is truly invested in bitcoin. It's a useful metric to compare multiple cryptocurrencies, but that's it. The vast majority of bitcoins weren't purchased at the most recent market price and there wouldn't be enough buyers to buy all of people's bitcoins at the most recent market price. If everyone decided to sell simultaneously, a few people would manage to sell their bitcoins for the most recent market price and then the price would crash and the market cap would melt with it.

"I like the idea of the technology.

I like the ideal of a decentralized currency where everyone helps participate. Buying and selling Bitcoin on a trading site is not participating in the technology. Mining is participating in the technology. Add with Bitcoin I cannot mine.

Once it was discovered that you could use a GPU to mine Bitcoin, the developers should have migrated to a stronger hashing algorithm - to ensure that the average individual can still contribute on their CPU. I want the digital currency that has a difficult to prove easy to verify algorithm. I want it so that GPUs and ASICs cannot be used.

The LiteCoin people understood that, and moved to the well-known memory hard function **scrypt** in 2011. And while they had valid reasons for choosing it to only require 128 KiB of RAM (e.g. it fits entirely in the L2 CPU cache, helping it run as fast as possible on the CPU), it only requires 128 KiB on RAM. This means that it could still be very parallelizable.

It **should** be 2  GiB of RAM.

- you not going to get custom ASIC advantage when you need to randomly access 2 GB of RAM
- video card bus bandwidth is such a throttle that it's doesn't help that your video card has 8 GB of RAM
- for someone with a modern desktop, two gigabytes of RAM out of your 24 is not that much to sacrifice to the cause
- the Google password hashing competition realized that it is the feeling of ram at maximum RAM bandwidth where are CPUs have their advantage
- fill RAM at maximum bus bandwidth with a very fast, very simple, hashing algorithm, optimized for x64 instruction set (rather than the various ad-hoc algorithms that scrypt internally uses)
- malware would not be able to hide 2 GB of RAM usage
- the appropriate verifier algorithm which makes it easy to verify, and difficult to prove

Ideally the Litecoin guys would admit the issues they have, note that their chosen parameters and chosen algorithm of a scrypt didn't work out in preventing the emergence of custom minors, and retune for a more egalitarian algorithm.

- There are other coins that try to thwart ASICs
- but they all still in embrace gpus

I want the coin that goes all in on fairness, equality, and a decentralized currency that everyone with a CPU can participate in.

"Lol this whole discussion was stupid as hell and I really wasn't going to participate but you argument is flawed. 

Yes a government has a huge overhead because it's a large bureaucratic apparatus. Does this mean that poverty on a national level would be better handled through charitable donations instead of taxes? No! There is a whole apparatus of people who look at how money can be used to help the lesser fortunate of society. As long as the goverment isn't corrupt wealth distribution is much more equal and effective on a national level then through taxes as by charitable donations.

The difference is that if you give to your church or directly to the homeless guy on the corner you see a direct impact. Through taxes maybe three homeless people are helped but they are from different parts of the country. In the latter case you might not notice it. 

Higher tax rate (adjusted for corruption in a country) is directly related to lower levels of poverty even compared to countries with much higher levels of charitable donations per capita. ";1;0;False;Scagnettio;dsdhrj0;Bitcoiners be like 😂;7oyba2;https://i.redd.it/srikkyu2cu801.jpg

"Ia 100%, tho you're way more idealistic than I am. I bought last year because I was curious what the applications could be. I saw it as untethered to the troubling fluctuations of gov't-controlled currency, trade and tax issues.

Still holding, and still think BTC has value as an asset and ETH/Alts have potential value as transactional currency. The involvement of gov'ts may enhance global transactions, but at the expense of decentralization. Most of what I see now is trading and arbitrage by small and large players for profit, benefiting those with access to tech and capital. 

I think we'll end up with blockchain apps and crypto that work well, albeit in a highly regulated way. I also think we'll always have an underground, untraceable form circulating. What we may not have (at least in my lifetime) is a truly decentralized currency that is accepted as legit. The application isn't going away.
