"fiat has the advantage of a 2% inflation target.  Bitcoin has a deflationary target with the limit of supply.  A modestly positive inflation target has proven very effective.

Think about it.  You are not suppose to make money sitting in cash.  You make money by investing in companies creating things.  The modest positive inflation rate encourages investment in ""real"" things - businesses, companies, housing, infrastructure, consumption, etc.  If you create a currency that has a high rate of deflation like 10% a year then people would be encouraged to invest in a fake thing (currency) instead of investing in a real thing (productive capacity).  This was a partial failing of the gold standard and bitcoin has the same problem.";2;0;False;chitraders;dp6znf7;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac
"You sound like a gold bug.  Biggest problem with bitcoin is the owners share the same opinions as gold bugs.  That there is a “real long term price of money”.  These theories have been thoroughly disproven.  

Money isn’t real.  It’s purpose is to facilitate commerce.  The fact is the dollar standard has done better than any other system and the kinks in the system have been corrected over time.  Things like a 2% inflation target long term are working out well.

Loans are for far more than just housing.  Businesses have debt as a form of fincancing.  They also have cash management needs like financing accounts receivables.  The purpose of money is facilitate trade and help economic growth.  

A lot of bitcoin guys seem to just want to take the seigniorage benefits of governments thru things like limiting supply of crypto.  If they really wanted to change the world they would eliminate the speculative element and try to build a system that is superior for trade.  

I’m interested in cryptos.  Perhaps they will better facilitate some aspects of commerce.  But the current incarnations look like nothing more than digital gold which isn’t that interesting.  

Will consider investing after the bust occurs.  Perhaps an amazon develops after the speculative market dies.";2;0;False;chitraders;dp6z0uu;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

Visa is centralised. In Bitcoin you sacrifice speed and efficiency for decentralisation, full control and freedom. Scaling takes time. One day Bitcoin will do more than Visa. Give it time. But I dont think it's that slow/ expensive. I wanted to sell some btc for cash. I send the coins for $0.50 fee. The tx takes 4 hours to confirm. They exchange sends me the money via bank transfer. The bank charges me  $1.10 and takes a day and a half for the transaction to go through.

AFAIK there was no scheduled fork today. The fork isn't occurring until block 494,784, which is estimated to be mined in a little over two weeks. This is pretty common knowledge among people involved in Bitcoin, so I doubt this rise has anything to do with people expecting a fork today.

Using an exchange as an exchange isn't the problem. The issue is how many people think an exchange account is a bitcoin account and don't ever actually see their own private key. Nothing wrong with using an exchange, I would just never direct a new user to start there. The exchanges want you to keep your money with them, they will never caution you to the risks or teach you anything about bitcoin. Bitcoin is being your own bank. Users should start by making a plan as to how they intend to be their own bank and what that will mean in their circumstance.;1;1;False;MrRGnome;dp7bvqa;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

We're also nearing the end of a tax year. People often sell assets for tax purposes (selling losers and winners to offset) and it's hard to find a bigger winner than BTC.  If that happens then there will be a marked decline followed by a bounce to start 2018.

"It's bad advice, I'm just pointing that out. Coinbase is not a company that should be thrown business by this community as they have spearheaded several anti-bitcoin practices and is the exact opposite of 'the best way to get started' with bitcoin. You want to invest? Use an investment fund like GBTC. You want to buy and use bitcoin? Buy bitcoin on an exchange (like Coinbase if you must) and withdraw - but even then that's not where you start. You start with the white paper, you start by learning how to secure your own coins. Telling people to just go and use Coinbase breeds the horrible practices we've seen of users exposing themselves to long term counterparty risk as well as gives this dangerous company more weight in their future attempts to subvert the bitcoin protocol for their own ends.

"It can be both, but growth at this rate is terrible for the coin. Not only for the coin, but the global economy.

When the bubble bursts (and it will), it will take semiconductor stocks with it. When that happens, it may trigger a big price correction in the stock market (which it is due for). This is recession territory. 

Even if you do not care about the stock market, it is BAD for the coin. No government is going to tolerate a rouge investment vehicle that drags markets down with it, and causes a recession.

This might sound hyperbolic (and maybe it is!), but crypto is a big factor in the current price of semiconductor stocks.

Cook: Would you like me to cut this into 6 slices or 8?

Customer: Better cut it into 8. We're pretty hungry!

If a guy honestly can't afford 0.005 BTC ($32.50), it might not be worth his effort to invest (although some believe that $32.50 will go to $2500 when BTC goes to $500k).

OTOH, if the guy has $325 to spend, but doesn't think he's getting enough Bitcoin when he only buys 0.05 BTC, then the answer is:

He should buy some mBTC instead! Right now, he can score *fifty thousand* mBTC for his $325. And it's guaranteed to go up at the same rate as Bitcoin!

"I do know what you mean and I'm not trying to just give you a hard time for a colloquialism; but I think that phrase needs to stop being used, because literally everything is being driven by speculation...

More importantly, for something that is a currency/money or becoming a currency (I.e. a medium of **indirect** exchange), you want speculation on its exchange value to be driving the exchange price.

You also need the volatility (which acts as almost a lottery mechanism coordinating a public good) to draw in speculators from corners they would not normally come from (including merchants, suppliers, consumers, employees, etc) so that the token is held widely and ubiquitously enough, that its network good (monetary) properties are actuated and transaction loops develop.  Virtually no one is, or can be expected to value the bitcoin token for itself right now (as it has very little utility outside of a vast network of people who use it in indirect exchange), and so the only rational thing for people to do at this point is to speculate (which includes hodling).

Bitcoin is not yet money. Money must be far more stable, but price stability is not going to come by way of some group-think or discipline that we try to enforce on ourselves.  Stability comes with market size and depth; until such time that goods and services can start to be denominated in BTC, which also produces a large stabilizing feedback of psychological expectations.";3;1;False;kwanijml;dp726ms;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

"Of course it'll correct once people cash out their forked coins, but by how much? ETH and Litecoin haven't enjoyed explosive growth, but they've been holding damn steady for months. What makes you think the money flowing into BTC is entirely pumped? Will it flow back into those coins? Will it all be taken out as cash? Or are people realizing that alt coins are still alt coins? No idea. I expect a drop, but I expect it'll be moderate. People gotta realize profits after all. I don't see it falling back to where it was even a few months ago. You can look at the trading volume  for BTG and BCC. I really don't the forked coins thing is going to matter that much. It might even push the price up as people sell the coins for bitcoin and hold the bitcoin.

What we have seen over the past few months is increasing, normalized, pros and cons type coverage from respected sources. Major industry players are putting out papers that reflect positively on it. CME has decided to open a derivatives market for bitcoin, which is something even a number of months ago they didn't think they'd bother with. Economists are studying it, books are being released, etc. There is media attention all over the place. Will the bubble pop? Yeah, at some point. But what will it deflate to? I don't think anyone has a good answer to that. Noone really knows what this thing is worth. Right now, the price is a best guess and yes, its based on a lot of optimism and opportunism, but that doesn't mean the guess is wrong. Hell, there's a good chance despite its meteoric rise that its still grossly undervalued.

">I'd say 70% of current value is speculation. 

That statement is nonsensical. Speculation isn't value. People speculate on things they think will be more or less valuable in the future (valuable in exchange or directly to themselves).

The current speculation and volatility serve a purpose. The price is probably going to crash again fairly soon. That's okay. That's what bitcoin does and its part of how widespread, ubiquitous holding of the token is coordinated, so that bitcoin can act as money.

"You don't really have Bitcoins on Coinbase. They have the Bitcoins and you have an IOU for Bitcoins but not for other coins. I think they will let you cash out both coins though. For example the recent Bitcoin Cash fork coins will be released in early 2018 to customers afaik. So it's all up to Coinbase.

For your personal wallet it depends on the situation after the fork:

Does 2X win and the old chain dies? 2X will be called Bitcoin, the wallet clients will update to 2X, you have to do nothing. Your old chain coins are worthless so you don't need to access them.

Does the old chain win and the 2X chain dies? Exactly the opposite.

If both chains survive it gets hairy, in that case Electrum will probably release a client (or integrate support) for the 2X chain as you need an extra 2X wallet to access your 2X coins.

That means hundreds of millions to billions of dollars worth of equity may be heading Bitcoin's way.

"Relative new-comer here. I have some cash to invest in some bitcoin and I want to do it now and hold for some lengthy period of time because I believe in the future of Bitcoin.

However, I'm having a hard time understanding this fork and figuring out if I buy some BTC now, if they will be safe during this fork. I have a private Electrum wallet. I'm not properly understanding the mechanics of this fork thing, more specifically, how it will affect my wallet and my coins.

Say I plan on holding on to the coins I buy for at least a year. Can I just buy some coins, store them in my Electrum wallet and just forget about the fork? It won't affect my money at all? How will the split between the future 2x and original btc affect me? What if 2x wins and is the new btc? Do I have to do anything in order to keep my coins? Do I need to decide which coin I want to follow and somehow convert my coins to that currency? (if it's 2x)

Also, is there a possibility that if this fork goes awfully wrong, the value of the bitcoin will be severely negatively affected?

Any elucidations on the above will be greatly appreciated. I want to make an investment and I'm aware of certain risks involved but I want to make sure I'm making an informed decision and not simply throwing money away because of some impending market/security disaster I can easily avoid.";38;5;False;snupicel;dp6pbk9;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

A.) No one knows



Q.) I don't want to buy until the dip, should I wait

A.) This has been said by countless people before you at every all time high, at every dip, and everything in between. The best time to buy if you are on the fence is now.



Q.) I'll die if I purchase at the all time high or if this goes down in the short term. Should I still buy?

A.) Stay far away from Bitcoin because you'll drive yourself crazy.

"Its going to hit somewhere between 7000-8000 and then something super spooky is going to happen again which will drive the price back down to 5k ~

Then it will push back up to around 10k before it happens again. Its getting pretty predictable at this point. The reason I say this is because its happened over and over and over again.

What will be interesting is what will cause the dip that will happen. We already did the big bank guy calling bitcoin a fraud. China is getting fucking old, they are irrelevant as far as I can tell. My guess is the plot this time will be a potential US government might pass super spooky legislation!!

The price will drop to 5k and it will bring out a bunch of ""I told you bitcoin was fake"" people. Then it will climb up to 9k in a few months after that.";102;3;False;;dp6olxw;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

"> I'm not properly understanding the mechanics of this fork thing, more specifically, how it will affect my wallet and my coins.

The fork practically copies the network history and therefore your coins into another network. If you had Bitcoins pre fork you will have Bitcoins and 2X coins after the fork.

> Say I plan on holding on to the coins I buy for at least a year. Can I just buy some coins, store them in my Electrum wallet and just forget about the fork?

yes

>How will the split between the future 2x and original btc affect me? What if 2x wins and is the new btc? Do I have to do anything in order to keep my coins? Do I need to decide which coin I want to follow and somehow convert my coins to that currency? (if it's 2x)

That's not 100% certain yet. The probability only one chain survives is pretty high. But since you have coins on both chains you don't need to do anything, you follow both chains automatically. If both chains survive you have to split your coins eventually when you want to move them.

>Also, is there a possibility that if this fork goes awfully wrong, the value of the bitcoin will be severely negatively affected?

Yes, of course. But remember you won't have both coins automatically if you buy after the fork.";5;1;False;RhinoScar;dp6s0yq;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png
Buy before the fork and move your coins to the blockchain, i.e. a wallet where you hold the keys. Electrum is an OK choice. Don't worry about short-term price swings and the panic that's sure to take place around or after the fork. Just keep hodling.;10;3;False;bytevc;dp6qtmv;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png
"If you believe in the long term future of bitcoin, buy before the fork - you won't lose your bitcoin once it happens. If it works like bitcoin cash and gold, you will get the same number of bitcoin in the new currency (although you'd have to transfer from electrum to recieve them). Obviously all uncertainty can make the price go down as well as up, and there's definitely uncertainty around segwit2x, but no one knows what the future holds so to reiterate, if you really believe in bitcoin, buy now - there's a lot of promise on the horizon; especially with the CME announcement.
