"> I'm not spreading FUD, you are spreading irrational exuberance.

Pointing out that the most talented cryptographers with programming experience are developing the most advanced solutions for bitcoin is ""irrational exuberance"" ?

The problem is you are not only make a incorrect assumption, you are also doing it out of context.

>Yahoo? Kodak? Lehman brothers?

Yes, you can cherry pick as many failures as you like. But the raw truth is that if you have 10 companies and 5 of them put minimal effort into their product and 5 put maximal effort into their product, the maximal effort companies are statistically much more likely to succeed.

>Number of people working on something doesn't mean much if they aren't well managed and working in the right direction.

Then its a damn good thing we have literally the most intelligent cryptographers with the most experience possible in this industry leading the way with their vision, eh?

"Nice analogy in the form of Monty Python. Care to talk in actual specifics?

We've seen Greece collapse under a debt that's 200% of their GDP, as well as many South American countries, etc. If an economy stalls and taxes are cut and spending goes up, and debt as a percentage of GDP gets too high, faith in a currency disappears and inflation goes crazy. But if you check those other countries, the U.S. is not even close yet. I'm not saying it can't/won't happen... but have you bothered to check? I believe we are at something like 75% of GDP in debt. If you extrapolate our trajectory, a collapse could maybe happen in the next 30 years or so.

"> Selling and re-balancing as you seem to have done, is smart.

I used to think so. The talking heads on CNBC are always saying stuff like ""take your profits"" and ""harvest your gains"".

But the handful of truly wealthy people I know don't do that. They don't sell after a double or a quintuple. They hold for decades, sometimes generations.

Warren Buffet said, ""our favorite holding period Is forever"".

He also said, ""whoever said you never go broke taking a profit is a fool"".

">Which one would that be?

Do you really have a hard time believing that there are fiat coins in circulation that are made out of 50% silver? Does this really even need to be addressed? [But if you really have a hard time believing it here is a link](http://www.silvercoinstoday.com/silver-coin-price-guides/canadian-silver-coin-values/) And I was wrong, it's actually 80% silver. 


>What are you saying, the coin is worth the coin?


I'm saying that most physical/cash currencies generally have more buying/barter on the current market than the material that they are made of. For example a single $100 note can easily buy you 100x the amount of paper of that $100 note. Canada stopped producing pennies a few years ago because it was costing 6 pennies to produce 1 coin. So the coin is actually worth more than the penny. If you had $100 worth of pennies it is now a more profitable to melt them down and sell them for their raw material than to spend them as ""currency"". 

>If you're a business dealing with a currency that fluctuates is a big problem as it leads to price instability.

Ya ya we've heard it all before. Bitcoin is too volatile blah blah blah. What this argument completely ignores is that bitcoin and tech is a completely new and immature asset market. As time goes and it becomes more liquid and traded globally volatility will decrease. Even the USD has had times of very high volatility. And it's already less volatile than several fiat currencies. Bitcoins biggest threat at the moment isn't economical but technological. If it can't find scaling solutions fast enough, it will probably only ever be digital gold while other currencies take over the cash aspect of the crypto space. Like ripple or dash.

And yes all currencies will be crypto in the next 30 years. Governments may issue or adopt crypto but I really don't think fiat as we know it is gonna last.

"It's not absurd at all. Think about how bitcoin has grown from $0 to a 300 Billion market cap and there's still only a few million people in the world holding any of it. Maybe 10 million or so with actual balances. 

They aren't making any more than 21m coins for sure, and it's estimated that ~4 million have been lost for good, so actually only 17,000,000 coins for 7,500,000,000 people. (Which equals  0.00266 BTC each if equally dispersed.)

We don't have wealth equality today, but if we did, or if you choose to look at the average wealth we all hold, then how much money and savings do we all own today? (Including off-shore bank accounts, physical precious metals, and anything else Bitcoin competes with.) Studies have been made about this many times, and Credit Suisse is kinda famous for pinpointing the global average of an adult at $52,800 USD recently. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/managing-wealth/112916/richest-and-poorest-countries-capita-2016.asp

So for the extreme adoption example, if that $52,800 were to eventually all be kept in bitcoin, logic dictates that it $52,800 =  0.00266.  This makes a single bitcoin worth $19,849,624. 

No, I don't expect that all the world's wealth will be in bitcoin one day, no matter how advanced its security is. But to say that 1/20th of that figure is impossible to me sounds just as crazy. Bitcoin is truly the best storage of value the world has ever seen and it will just keep getting better and more useful.

">Also, I presume, commodities were the original asset class? 

No, to paraphrase Nick Szabo, the first asset class was the durable skeletal parts of our prey. It even seems that Neanderthals were using parts of rare birds of prey as a form of proto money. 

You are making the common mistake of using your experience to predict the future value of something that you don't have experience with. 

This isn't about first mover advantage or network effect. It is about game theory. There is a great deal of arbitrariness that goes into determining what humans use as ledgers to keep track of and store value, and this arbitrariness magnifies the cues that we are given and makes them determinative, absent other overwhelming considerations. 

There is a point in these discussion where metaphor simply breaks down, but I will try to join you in using them anyway. We still use ""feet"" and ""meters"" to measure things. These standards are thousands and hundreds of years old respectively. Why, when there are so many other systems that could be used? The reason is that it is mutually beneficial for humans to have shared systems of measurement. It does not often even matter much which ones we use, as long as we use the same ones to measure the same things. 

And the standard for measurement of value in this new era, an era ushered in by the invention of functional digital scarcity, is the *original* and thus the *authentic*, implementation of this invention.

">there's such a think as claiming gambling losses too

Exactly. They're deductible but only from your winnings, so if over the course of the year your winning bets total $10,000 and your losing bets total $7,000, you are only to pay tax on your $3,000 profit.

That was my point, that it seems like it would be very easy to simply claim losses on bets that you never made, especially if you do your gambling via offshore sportsbook online. So say for the sake of argument you won 100,000 in a given year, chose not to pay taxes, and got audited. If you send them your fabricated spreadsheet tracker with losses totaling say 80,000, you'd still have the $100,000 in your pocket but only have to pay taxes on $20,000 of it.

Like I said though, I would never actually do it myself. Just making conversation and to be honest I'm a little shocked at how seemingly bulletproof the ""gambling"" excuse is for tax evaders.

This is consistent with the dominant view among economists, but it is wrong, or at least incomplete. It does not take into account how absolutely powerful proto money and then money was and is for humans, and the role it has played in our domination of the planet. A substance that is durable, fungible, granular, easily transportable, and unforgeably costly to produce or procure is useful to humans because it is able to act as a ledger, a counting system that allows us to cooperate to an amazingly unprecedented degree for vertebrates. There is nothing especially useful about the eagle claws that Neanderthals collected with what must have been great effort. Nor did early humans in Africa gain much utility from the beads that they spent hundreds of hours creating. Legacy economists will explain that these things were ""adornments"", but this doesn't explain why so much effort would be spent making and acquiring them. What explains this is that  the items were a form of proto money.

"Gold not so much, but silver and copper is still used as currency. A quick google check and the coins of my national currency are 50% silver.

Although they have been phasing out the smaller denominations of coins because it costs more than they are worth to produce. So ironically it's because metals are such a good store of value relative to the fiat currency that the metal that is used, is worth more than the amount of fiat the coins represent. So if anything this shows that metal(a commodity) is a better currency because it's a better store of value. Logically speaking, a physical coin can never be worth less than the metal it is printed on,  but it can be worth more. But if you believe bitcoin is a better store of value than gold then you have a pretty strong argument to use it as currency.

"One small additional bit of advice, and I totally understand you disregarding it. 

Consider your crypto speculation an investment you make AFTER you've fulfilled some more pressing financial tasks. Paying off high interest debt and maxing out your IRA removes doubt about the future and has a more important and more immediate return than Bitcoin ever will.

If we're all wrong and Bitcoin pops tomorrow, you'll still have reduced your debts and you'll still have your retirement account.

I don't plan nor expect to get insanely rich on Bitcoin. I invest maybe 8% of my income into Bitcoin because it's a smart investment, but I put significantly more into my Ira and my debts and those always come first.

"This is a [1:10000 rule](https://xkcd.com/1053/) argument for me.  I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.

I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.

"My point was that ""shit you can't afford"" is not up to you, and can be rapidly pulled out from under you. In your hypothetical worst case scenario of being stuck with a mortgage and McD's employment:

$8.67 * 262 * 8 = $18,172
remove 6.2% for social security withholding = $17,045
You save 84% off your healthcare mandate, so you only have to pay $738, bringing your take-home to = $16,307
You own your own car and it's electric, so you don't need to buy transit or make car payments or buy fuel, but insurance takes you down $1,297(natl avg) and repairs take another $1,186(natl avg new), leaving you $13,824.
Your house has a crazy grandfathered property tax rate of $800 and your (natl avg) $1,083 home insurance mandated by your mortgage leaves you $11,941.
You only do absolutely necessary repairs and spend $1,000 per year on home repairs, so you have $10,941.
You have only $50/mo in bills total, down to $10,341.

So after everything you're required to pay to satisfy legal obligations, you've got $861/mo to do anything other than your terrible job. And you're going to give how much of that to a banker for an underwater asset?

"Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule](https://xkcd.com/1053/) for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :

You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?

If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.

Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.

What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

"Well I think yes and no. I'm not sure whether to call is a fault or not. Part of Bitcoin's purpose is to put people in control of their own money. Being in control comes with risks like this though, which is probably part of the reason the institutions we have that protect transactions today came into being. There's only so much a decentralized system can do to protect the people using it, without compromising it's decentralized nature. So it's a fault of the system, but also part of it's own design. 

It's certainly a tough problem to solve. I think it's completely insufficient for people to say that people will learn to be careful with addresses from their mistakes. What if a random person is trying to send hundreds of dollars and that's when they accidentally send it to the wrong place? That's an expensive mistake that we shouldn't just accept as part of the system. Sure, they *should* have double checked when sending a large sum of money, but maybe they always double check and then, just one time, they were in a hurry and forgot to. People make mistakes.

The formula is basically

(Price sold * AMOUNT) - (Price bought * AMOUNT)

"I don't know the answer! What portion of Bitcoin's market cap ($160 billion) is fair value vs. speculative mania and will disappear when the current bubble pops?

How to value a currency? There are no profits/earnings associated with a currency. With Bitcoin it's sort of a proxy for the profits of associated businesses with real-world Bitcoin applications. But those businesses likely aren't worth anywhere near Bitcoin's market cap.

Without an underlying value (like the U.S. dollar, or gold), the only reason to expect Bitcoin to appreciate more is if more people want it in the future than now. And right now that's probably primarily driven by mania, with a smaller component involved in actual use cases.

If you are betting on profiting from the speculative mania portion, how will you know when it's *""doubled enough""* and the next crash is time to get out? How far will it have to rise or fall for you to decide it's been enough?

What dominos show the unwinding? **Macro imbalances take decades to play out. If some effect is happening right now, it would be visible in economic data.**

If debt size has suddenly become so large as to cause Bitcoin's rise from 2016 to today, why is it not affecting the slew of other assets that are more sensitive to debt?

"First, definitely not a stupid question. It's much better to get answers for your crypto questions before you start buying stuff.

/u/argon5000 mentioned cashflow, but that's not the real point of dollar-cost averaging (investing a set amount of $ at regular intervals rather than investing all of the $ at one time). Although you believe the price is going to rise, it's also going to drop at points. Many people try to predict these peaks and dips and you will hear a countless number of stories about these people losing a lot of money trying to do this, which is essentially day trading. Along with the high volatility of the market, there's not really good historical data to work off of because crypto is such a relatively new thing. Point being - do not day trade.

If you're investing a little bit of your money in intervals over time you average out your risk throughout the regular market dips and peaks. As a very simple example, if you bought $1,000 of BTC this week and the price ends up dropping next week, you lose value on your entire $1,000 investment. 

However, if you bought $500 of BTC this week, and then $500 next week, you will lose value on your original $500 investment, but then you'll be buying at a better price next week when you spend your other $500.

The downside is, of course, if the BTC price actually ended up rising after that first week then your investment with the $500 will grow less than if you invested $1,000 up front. But again, that's not something you should try to predict. So the point is to invest that set amount of $ each week and your gains and losses from market volatility will average out. By doing this investing in regular intervals, you are still banking on the price going up over time, but you won't lose your shirt by buying a ton of BTC at once right at a peak (remember: you won't know it's a peak until the price starts dropping again).";4;1;False;ZendrixUno;dqgi77s;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

">Most people here are obsessed with ""buying the dip"", but how does it matter if you belive Bitcoins are going to 100K$+ if you bought at 9K or 8.5k?

On the contrary, a 5% difference in current prices is a 5% difference in future gains.

Say you want to invest $10k, and will pull out when the price reaches $100k.  If you buy at $9k, that's $101,111 of gains.  if you buy at $8.5k, that's $107,647 of gains. That's a difference of $6536 dollars!  Would you rather have or not have $6536 dollars? Whether I'm rich later or or, I'd still rather have an additional $6536 than not have it.

That being said, however, even attempting to buy at $8.5k over $9k is trying to play the market.  To brag, I have a PhD in data analysis. I spent 4 months straight before I could find any recognizable patterns in the market, and even then, only 50.01% of the time for very small quantities.  The market is effectively random.

"Coinbase does not give you the seed and handles security for you. Coinbase could freeze your account for whatever reason. Also, exchanges get hacked: [(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox). When you have your bitcoins in a more secure wallet, no one can stop you from accessing your funds. Hacks are much, much less likely. I use Greenaddress for iPhone and a Trezor [(https://trezor.io)](https://trezor.io) for larger amounts. I recommend those because the transactions fees from those wallets are cheaper than most. Other recommended wallets can be found here[https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). 

A seed is usually 12-24 words that you write down when setting up these more secure wallets and store in a safe place. Even if GreenAddress, for example, disappeared of the face of the earth, your phone got run over by a car, you lost your Trezor...if you have those 12-24 words, you should be able to access your funds. Those two are very user friendly, without technically computer knowledge or anything like that. 

Saying you are over your heads makes me think you invested too much money. Bitcoin is not a guaranteed road to riches. Only invest what you are willing to lose. Plus, if you invest too much, you risk panic selling if bitcoin drops more than 10% in value in one day, which happens. Keep reading and asking question.

"[Coinbase.com](Coinbase.com) is the easiest and most beginner way I can think of to buy. You can use credit/debit or link your bank account. They do ask for some information, but the flip side is they make it very, very easy.   Coinbase is the most popular way to get bitcoin for a reason. There are some fees, but you’ll get the majority of what you spend in bitcoin. 

You’ll want to send your bitcoin to a more secure wallet than what Coinbase offers though. Choose a wallet here: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). A mobile wallet for the max amount you would keep in your leather wallet or purse, and/or a hardware wallet for larger amounts. I use GreenAddress for iPhone and a Trezor hardware wallet ([https://trezor.io](https://trezor.io). I recommend those two because the fees are cheap and although there are some advanced features, I found the general use very easy.  

No matter how glamorous and user friendly Coinbase’s wallet and vault features seem, don’t store your coins there. Exchanges get hacked. [(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) And although Coinbase may be insured, it might be a long time until you get any money back. Certainly not right away. You’ve been warned.

Don’t talk about how much bitcoin you buy. Read and ask more questions. r/bitcoinbeginners is great. Invest only what you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is not a guaranteed get rich scheme. It could go to $1 (unlikely but could) or it could go to over 100k. Investing too much will leave you checking the price constantly, and you risk panic selling. Greater than 10% drops in value in a day do happen. And if you did not already know, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin.

It’s best to use a wallet recommend on the official bitcoin site: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). Mobile wallets or hardware wallets are best. Paper wallets are for advanced users. Use a mobile wallet for max amounts you would keep in your leather wallet or purse, and a hardware wallet for larger amounts. I use GreenAddress for iPhone and a Trezor hardware wallet: [(https://trezor.io)](https://trezor.io). Those two allow for less expensive transactions than most wallets. Do not keep your funds on an exchange [(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) or a wallet that does not give you complete control over your funds. Coinbase is great for buying if you are a beginner but it is not safe to keep your bitcoin there long term.

"Kudos to you! I just did the same, but for a vastly smaller scale. Well, I didn't cash out completely, only about 1/5th the total value. But it was to pay debt, because, while I do feel Bitcoin will continue to rise and has a promising future...reaping some real world impact of the gains became more and more important as the price rises. To anyone here before the goxxening, you know. Seeing four figures become five figures become four figures again, practically over night was...intense. Probably won't happen again like it did then, but...1000% increases can only happen for how many years in a row before one Bitcoin is worth more than all the money in the world?

Be sane. Don't over extend yourself. When I first invested, I stuck by the ""don't invest more than you're willing to lose"".

"As Yogi Berra says, ""It's tough to make predictions--especially about the future,"" but I'm pretty confident this Bitcoin post-Trump speculation bubble will burst within a year...

 So I will prolly invest into blockchain tech once its bubble deflates/resets, because its value seems pretty unstably carbonated atm. Again, I haven't read any convincing argument that Blockchain tech does not have use or value--I just think it's impracticably overvalued atm.

"In my personal opinion (and its only that)  the point of 'dollar cost averaging' is, especially with such a volatile currency, to leverage against large movements and to attempt to get the average cost available for the currency.

With Bitcoin, ethereum, and some of my other coins, I believe they are wholly undervalued at today's price, so in my situation it would do me best to get in period. Knowing that it is ""impossible to time the market"" and that I cannot look at coin charts 24 hours a day AND that greed is the root cause of loss in any investing, I choose to attempt to catch 400%, even though I realistically could catch significantly more than that.

But if I really could, I would have already. And despite our generous opinions of ourselves most of us are incapable of really successfully doing that.

All that being said, investing a smaller amount monthly might be a good idea as one can reasonably assume that the price of Bitcoin or whatever crypto will be more next month than it will this month and you could be unnecessarily missing out on potential profits. I'm sure there's math that can be done to conclude the best time frame, I've personally just picked every Friday because of the effect the weekend has on the price and because I always have an extra $50 kicking around on Fridays to invest. 

News, major events, and gossip all have bearing on the weekly price of a crypto.

And to just answer your question frankly, I'd see if there's a pattern to the lowest price of Bitcoin every month and stick to that. Baring that, I'd invest your money the day it becomes available to invest. Just get in soon while its fresh.

If you don't have a job, and sell that 1 BTC you bought at 1$ for 37500$, then your capital gains would be 37499, and your total income would be 37499, which would exempt you from paying taxes on that amount, assuming you don't make any other money the rest of the year.

"> The only thing would be if you had a virus and it changed the copy/paste address to a malicious one and you dind't notice.

Or you re-use an old one, copy-paste the wrong one, etc. Crappy UX is still quite common in the realm of wallets. So choosing a previous used address is not always very clear. ""Was that the 'kraken_03' from where I sent the BTC to my wallet, or that I used to send the BTC to the exchange? Seriously: that question is nearly impossible to answer within several of the wallets I use. 

Addresses are hard to read[1] and type. Typo's, however, are not the problem. Because they are so hard to type, you need a manager for addresses, or at least some solid copy-paste system. No-one is going to type over an address displayed on a desktop screen onto his mobile. That is just too error prone (which, again, in itself is the not the issue, because of checksums), but require again other software, like QR-code generators, -readers, ""share-clipboard-between-mobile-and-desktop"" etc. 

TL;DR: UX of many clients, wallets, exchanges suck. Combined with it being practically impossibile to type over an anddress makes is enough ingredient to ""get it wrong"".

"The most popular way to get bitcoin is Coinbase. They also provide a wallet. They do not give you a word seed. They market themselves as being almost like a bitcoin bank. But bitcoin is supposed to be about getting control over your money. They make it seem much more difficult than it really is. While it’s true that if you lost the 12-24 word seed and lost the password to your wallet, you are shit out of luck. But I don’t think Coinbase should have vault features that attract people to store in there long term. It’s not a good idea to keep your money on exchanges long term.

Someone who does little effort and just googles “How to buy bitcoin?” and no further research will most likely keep their funds on Coinbase and not in a more secure wallet.

Mortgage loans can be fixed, variable (attached to prime) or mixed. Up here in Canada there can be some big penalties for paying off fixed rate between terms, variable is typically 3 months interest.  Variable typically tends to be cheaper long term, but some people prefer the stability of fixed. Most mortgages get renewed every 5 years the rate gets renegotiated then.  So if rates jump even on fixed you can expect to have a higher rate on renewal. I heard American mortgages are tax deductible (I'm not sure if that's universal or not) whereas we don't get that in Canada so there maybe be some advantages like that for keeping a mortgage that we don't get. Bank of Canada has been hinting strongly of yearly prime rates going up about a percent a year for the the next several years.

"It’s best to choose a more secure wallet than the one Coinbase provides on this official bitcoin website: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). Mobile wallets and hardware wallets are recommended. Paper wallets are for advanced users. I use GreenAddress for iPhone and a Trezor hardware wallet ([(https://trezor.io)](https://trezor.io). Mobile wallets for max amounts you would keep in your leather wallet or purse, and a hardware wallet for larger amounts. 

Hacks are much less unlikely with these more secure wallets, and no1 can stop you from accessing your funds. You don’t need expert computer knowledge or anything like that to get started. Both are user friendly. Which ever wallet you choose, send a small amount first to make sure you’re doing it right. 

You’ll get a 12-24 word seed that you write down on a couple of pieces of paper (or even better: [https://cryptosteel.com](https://cryptosteel.com) ) and store them in a safe place. That way even if you lose your Trezor, or you drop your phone in water, etc, you will be able to access your funds with the phrase.

Some debt can be constructive, providing write offs and tax shelters.

"It's not always a good idea to pay $100,000 down on your mortgage all at once if you suddenly find yourself with that much money. If you spend everything you've got just to be free of debt, and don't leave yourself extra money for emergencies then you are putting yourself at huge risk. It's better to keep the $100,000 invested and earning interest while also getting the mortgage tax deduction. If you lose your job, you can get your $100,000 out of the investments as needed, but if you use it to pay off your house, and lose your job, then you have nothing left for expenses or emergencies.

If your investment interest is greater than your mortgage rate then your mortgage is actually profitable. And that doesn't even take the mortgage tax deduction into account. I've already paid off one mortgage, sold that house, bought another one and I'm about to pay off my second mortgage. I only did it because I am extremely limited in what I can invest in.

"Yeah I personally don’t understand the paying off your mortgage. Interest rates are so low it’s practically free money over the course of 30 years.  Pay a little extra on top and that balance drops substantially.  I’ve been rounding my mortgage payment to the nearest whole dollar and after 6 years I only have 15 years left on it.  Also your payment still exists to some degree, I mean you’re paying property taxes and more than likely insurance if you just paid off your house you don’t want it to burn down and not be able to get another, that would be a waste of 21 BTCs.  

And if you’re just going to buy back into BTC then it doesn’t make sense to have sold your current stash bc your monthly income doesn’t change.  If the $800 you were putting towards mortgage is now towards new BTC purchases, you could’ve held your 21BTCs worth roughly 200K, hoped for a measly 15% annual return from BTC which is LOW given its track record and made 30K a year the next couple years, the money you used on your mortgage has now paid it down even more while your BTC stash has grown so maybe now you only owe 185K and your 21BTCs are worth 285K. 

I mean cudos to you for being disciplined and doing what you felt made you happy, and maybe bitcoin tanks to zero and we look back on you as a genius, I just don’t see how I could sell at this moment if I had that many BTCs. With the CME futures on the horizon, continued global awareness and acceptance, and a potential ETF coming, it is an interesting decision to 100% leave.";2;0;False;JesC929;dqfurix;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/

"Not a full understanding, but a basic fundamental one. 

It’s often repeated because it bears repeating. Voluntary adoption of anything requires some understanding of how the thing works. I’m not saying one need to know how the actual processor of a phone works, but the need to be able to understand how the OS functions. How to make a call.  How to open the internet app. That’s sort of thing. 

Bitcoin doesn’t make sense for a lot of folks beyond the nitty gritty. Why does the uSD need replacing?  Why is the a benefit to anyone?  How can I spend a currency whose value is constantly changing?  How do I get any?  How do I use it?  What’s the deal with “cold storage wallets” and keys and strings and stuff?  Aren’t people sitting on millions that they can’t get to because they can’t remember the password?  Didn’t a lot of them disappear or get stolen or something?  Wasn’t this stuff worthless like 2 years ago?  What the hell is mining?  Why don’t we just go back to using gold?  (Please don’t answer these questions, I’m not asking them, I’m posing them as questions someone would have. They are rhetorical). 

About the only thing that is easily digestible is that a bitcoin is something people want right now and are willing to pay about 10G for one of them. 

Realistically, in order to replace the current currency, a new one has to be better. Offer something really great. Bitcoin doesn’t do that, largely because currency works pretty flawlessly as intended, as a means for storing value to trade for goods and services. What’s more, it’s value is backed by something. Once it was gold, but now it’s the government itself. BTC is backed by nothing and so it’s value is entirely at the whims of the subjective mob. There is literally nothing preventing it from being worth 1 cent tomorrow. Nothing, save for the fact that more people are buying than are selling. Which, as anyone who has ever worked with commodities can tell you, is not particularly stable. That makes for a worse currency, not a better one. 

But, that could change. The more it is adopted, the more stabile it becomes. The more it is baked into the system, the more improbable it is to crash. It’s got a huge potential to work, but it’s still a big question mark if it will. Right now, it’s all speculation and hype.

">hyper-inflation is laughable in the United States.

Why?

>You think the average American actually thinks something like this might happen. (hyperinflation)

I know for a fact that the average American doesn't. This is why I, unfortunately, think many will be caught off guard. They sure were during the 2008 crisis when convinced that home equity evaluations couldn't go down.

>when you realize you are wrong.
>Fiat currencies are superior to gold based currencies which is why we moved to them. 

Why am I wrong? I gladly accept criticism.

>Massive legitimate corporations

What makes a corporation legitimate versus not? Why would you discount today's corporations investing in Bitcoin as ""illegitimate""? If Amazon and Overstock.com accept Bitcoin as payment, will you call them illegitimate? I don't understand.

>Its inherent to the form of the currency.

No it isn't. Because currency can also be money. The earliest civilizations didn't even coin their gold. They simply measured the gold by weight and conducted business that way. Because of this, the currency/money of gold was 100% interchangeable between different states and different civilizations. No need for a state backing. State-backing is not an inherent quality of currency.

> Which is real money. (fiat currency)

Real money stores value regardless of fiat. Currency does not store value. Especially because it is subject to excess printing and hyperinflation. Check any chart of USD since its creation. Stagnant to nonexistant inflation while it is pegged to gold and then a rapid loss of value from 1913 to today as it was gradually phased off of gold. The USD has lost 95% of its purchasing power since it was created.

>The American dollar has not though

Has not =/= will not. But again, the USD has lost 95% of its purchasing power already. If a disruptive event occurs, such as the collapse of the oil-pegged petro dollar, you could easily see a hyper-inflationary event. To deny this possibility is to deny the fact that things change and it is to deny history. Greeks debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. Romans debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. The Wiemar republic debased their currency and it hyper-inflated. The United States has been debasing the USD for decades, but luckily it is enforced in its use in many international trade agreement. Hyperinflation has happened many times before. All of these aforementioned currencies began as pure gold standard pegs and gradually phased out into debased fiat currencies. (Copper coinage as an stand in for today's paper fiat because it has very large supply potential although not truly infinite like today's fiat).

>by law must be accepted by all vendors in the worlds biggest economy.

That's what makes it subject to a hyper-inflationary disaster. I seriously suggest you research and understand the USD as the world's current reserve currency status. It is largely based on deals and trade agreements (OPEC as an example) which require the use of the US dollar in international trade and in the sale of natural resource commodities like oil. I will state it again because it is incredibly important. Trillions of USD exist outside of the US in foreign accounts. USD is used for the aforementioned purposes in international exchange. If this no longer becomes the case, then the dollar is in SERIOUS trouble of suffering hyperinflation. No longer needed for use in global exchange, these dollars will naturally find themselves being spent in the one place that requires their acceptance by LAW; the United States. Cue hyperinflation of goods and services in the United States due to a massive influx of USD supply. This is no joke. I'm not just trying to ""hype"" Bitcoin. I'm trying to find a solution to a very real problem that exists for the USD. And for many of the worlds fiat currencies for that matter.

>I understand, you are part of the hype train. I get it. It's just pure fantasy.

A sudden loss in their purchasing power is a *really* good reason.

>no reason to think the value of BTC would rise in a hyper-inflationary event. In fact BTC is far more susceptible to rapid rises and falls than $s.

You're thinking of volatility, not inflation. Inflation is gradual and permanent. It is caused by the expansion of the money supply. Volatility is different. Volatility is caused by day to day changes in the *demand* of a thing. Again, its the *supply* that causes inflation.

>So can dollars. Whats your point?

How can dollars be made immune to theft?

>Older societies used precious medals as currencies.

The point is, gold has always been the ""money"" and there has occasionally existed a respective ""currency"" to back that money. When gold was used as coinage, it was both the money and currency simultaneously. Now, we don't really even have money. We just have a bunch of fiat currencies.

>Except for having to buy the currency with real money, have an encrypted wallet, have to constantly convert it to real money to spend it and work outside the traditional financial sector, its super easy!

You can transfer Bitcoin peer to peer, or directly to a store that accepts it either online or in person over your smartphone. I'm not disputing the fact that Bitcoin is *currently* in small scale use. That's not the issue here. The issue here in the potential use and whether or not it has inherently superior qualities to the current system. One of the main arguments against the internet in the early 90s was that is was ""clunky"" and that ""nobody used it"". Well. Things change. And they can change over the course of just a few decades. Or do you still believe we should use horses because there aren't enough paved roads around?

>I know you think your use of ""inherently"" is super profound

No. I just understand the definition of ""inherently"". If you're claiming that fiat currency is ""inherently"" more useful is to misunderstand the definition of ""inherently"". Otherwise, you could still, *inherently*, choose to use of the the thousands of deceased fiat currencies in your day to day transactions.

>Real money does everything BTC and more! Why the hell would your average person change?

We don't currently use real money. We use fiat currency. Fiat currency has a tendency to become inflated into oblivion. If the U.S. government fails to maintain the monopolized use of the dollar in international oil and energy transactions, then the value of the dollar will take a big hit. A massive portion of U.S. currency exists in accounts or in cash outside of the United States. Mostly because it pegs the vast majority of oil and energy transactions. If the dollar falls out of the favor of the global energy market, all those dollars are going to be pumped back into the United States. Result? Hyperinflation.

"Yes. Only a tiny percentage of people buying bitcoin at the moment are using it as a currency. 

Bitcoin is getting less useful as a currency (higher fees and longer confirmation times), at the same time prices are soaring. This is the opposite of what you'd want or expect to see from a currency that was being adopted for its use.

Most people are buying for exactly the motivations you find everywhere in this thread and sub. They believe Bitcoin will be worth far more in the near future so they buy with the hope of getting rich quick. 

This is actively harmful for its adoption as a currency. Bitcoins price is rising so fast no one wants to spend it, and because no one wants to spend it, no one is interesting in accepting it. All this while all the people buying bitcoin just to profit off it are increasing fees and transaction times.

It's shocking that deflationists continue to dismiss the idea that ""just because a currency keeps rising in value doesn't mean people won't spend it, people still need to buy stuff"", when this is *exactly* what is happening with bitcoin.

Usually this is dismissed by saying that bitcoin just needs to hit some arbitrary price point (usually the kind of price that will make them a bitcoin millionaire), then somehow the price will ""stabilize"", ""level off"" or hit ""equilibrium"" and suddenly start being used as a currency. Which is what you need to believe if you want to believe that you're going to turn a thousand dollars into millions and then not have the price crash when everyone decides to spend their millions at once. 

A brief glance at the bitcoin whitepaper would tell you this future ""stabilization"" can never happen. Bitcoins currently being produced at the highest rate possible and its still highly deflationary relative to the amount of money flooding in. Soon the supply rate will halve, and then halve again, until eventually it will stop completely, at which point bitcoins will continue to get lost while no new ones are being made and you will hit hyper-deflation.";1;1;False;suninabox;dqgdoub;Buying Bitcoin at $9,700;7frumr;https://i.redd.it/u8wl7qgxhf001.png
">Because it isn't valuable by way of being so common. Consider the water and diamonds example. Everyone might need water, but it just isn't as valuable as diamonds because it is so abundant.

So the world would be better if water was more expensive so people could make money from selling water?

We don't benefit from things being expensive or scarce. We want every good to be as available as possible. Ideally everything would be infinitely available, but so long as energy and matter are limited that's not going to happen. It doesn't mean we can't use technology to produce as many goods as possible with the energy and matter we have available.

The example of a farmer who can't make as much money from cheap crops is not an example of harm from over supply, that just means other farmers are doing a better job of growing that crop and he should start growing something else there is greater demand for. If it costs a farmer $5 to make a ton of corn, and he can only sell it for $4 a ton, that means there's some farmers out there who can make it for less than $4 a ton, so that farmer is wasting resources trying to grow corn and should grow something else (ignoring the negative impact government subsidies can have).

">an economic shock so big that it would make crypto irrelevant.
Financial crisis can be shocking enough, but not so disastrous that an apocalyptic collapse of the economy occurs... That wasn't the case during the stock market crash of the late 20s and during the Great Depression. I don't think that will be the case during the next economic shock.

I'm not advocating an apocalyptic collapse of the economy. I'm merely acknowledging the fact that the United States probably won't forever be the dominant force in the world and that inflation of the likes seen during the 70s (gold standard ended in 1971...) or worse is not an *impossible* scenario. I've merely identified a few points of weakness in the monetary system. I've yet to be satisfied with an argument that actually addresses these points of weakness.

> BTC is extremely tiresome and hard to use for the average person.

Yes... and so were computers in their early development. The average person was absolutely clueless and the computer was rendered for use by nerds only. I just don't see how the current status of crypto-clunkiness necessarily precludes it from being less clunky in the future... Plenty of companies have formed to solve this very problem. I'm assuming they will be successful in creating convenience of use. You assume they won't. That's fine, but I don't understand why.

>No one can see the future. I doubt the dollar will get hyper-inflated.

Your first sentence explains my thoughts, exactly, as to why the second sentence should be of concern. Not irrational concern, but still. It's a serious issue to consider.

>but BTC will never be widespread in circulation

Japan, Korea, and China account for over 60% of crypto investments. Adoption of crypto by physical merchants is far ahead of the United States. Bitcoin doesn't need to be adopted in the United States to be widely successful.

>Its a massive contradiction for christsake. The characteristics of a good investment are contradictory to the characteristics of a good currency.

I personally don't think Bitcoin will succeed as a currency. I think it will succeed as a money, store of value, like gold. Some other cryptos, on the other hand, are hand tailored to function as a currency and a currency alone.

"> A sudden loss in their purchasing power is a really good reason.

There are three things that are funny about this

1. American currency is extremely stable. It is far more stable tha BTC has been.

2. You think BTC would for some reason not fall when the dollar does. There is no reason to think that.

3. You think the average American actually thinks something like this might happen.

>You're thinking of volatility, not inflation

I'm not actually. I just assumed you were talking about any massive loss in purchasing power. Mainly because hyper-inflation is laughable in the United States.

>The point is, gold has always been the ""money"" and there has occasionally existed a respective ""currency"" to back that money. When gold was used as coinage, it was both the money and currency simultaneously. Now, we don't really even have money. We just have a bunch of fiat currencies.

You might rethink things when you realize you are wrong. It actually sheds light on the issue. Fiat currencies are superior to gold based currencies which is why we moved to them.

> One of the main arguments against the internet in the early 90s was that is was ""clunky"" and that ""nobody used it"". 

LMAO the only people who said that we're nobodies. Massive legitimate corporations had been investing in computers and the internet since the 60's.

>No. I just understand the definition of ""inherently""

No brah, ya dont

Inherent

>existing in something as a permanent, essential, or characteristic attribute.

State backed currency *inherently* has value. If a currency becomes non-state backed, it has changed its form. Do you understand. Its inherent to the form of the currency.

Just like crypto has certain properties, fiat money does too.

>We don't currently use real money. We use fiat currency.

Which is real money. 

>Fiat currency has a tendency to become inflated into oblivion

The American dollar has not though, which is what we are talking about.


Think about it dude. You argument is that a digital currency that no one accepts as payment for goods or services has a liklier chance of surviving economic oblivion than a currency that is the world reserve currency and by law must be accepted by all vendors in the worlds biggest economy. 

I understand, you are part of the hype train. I get it. It's just pure fantasy. You still haven't given me one reason the avearge American should switch to BTC. All of your reasons are why enthusiasts like BTC. Not only that, your reasons are pure speculation, its not even based in evidence.

"I'll put it this way. In order for hyper-inflation to happen in the US, there would have to be an economic shock so big that it would make crypto irrelevant. It's the same with gold. If it ever gets to the point where US currency is worthless, no one is going to want your gold or crypto. Those with wealth will want real assets like land and everyone else will want food.

I can see you buy into a lot of the same poor economic thought that gold bugs do. 

Ive pointed out how you are wrong, you just don't want to believe it. 

Your whole argument boils down to the idea that crypto would be stable if the dollar became hyper-inflated. You aren't even addressing the reality that BTC is extremely tiresome and hard to use for the average person. 

My point is that crypto value fluctuates wildly now, and there is no reason to think a currency that can't be spent anywhere will retain value in the event of an economic collapse.

No one can see the future. I doubt the dollar will get hyper-inflated. Controlled inflation is a useful tool and no amount of Ron Paul speeches will change that. 

The reality is that crypto is at best a tool for drug dealers. It just doesn't work in the real world. Parts of the technology will be adopted, but BTC will never be widespread in circulation.

"Wow, you're really having a hard time with this.

The question was:

>How is this not a bubble?

My answer was:

>Because in 5 years it'll be way higher. Zoom out.

My point is that the definition of ""bubble"" depends entirely on your point of view.  By *most* definitions, yeah, it looks like a bubble.  But if you zoom *in*, all the little monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and minute-ly gyrations also look like bubbles.  Why do you think that the 2013 run-up in price was a ""bubble"", but bitcoin popping from $7900 to $5400 just a couple weeks ago wasn't?  I'll tell you why; it's because you don't care about time scales that short, and the price was back up over $7900 within a couple of weeks.  If the price had kept declining over the next few months or years, everyone would have called it a bubble.  Why?  Because a few months or years is a long time for an asset to be declining, in most people's view.

But if you're like me and you believe bitcoin will continue to grow over the next decade or two, you don't care as much about short-term gyrations such as the big one in 2013.  From that point of view, a 4-year moving average is perfectly reasonable.

>If only it is understood that the value of their dollars keeps going down and the value of that magic Internet money keeps going up, especially during a hyperinflationary scenario, they will adopt it.

And there is no reason to think the value of BTC would rise in a hyperinflationary event. In fact BTC is far more susceptible to rapid rises and falls than $s. You could easily see 25% of your networth wiped out in a matter of hours with BTC.

>Currencies backed by gold, and not the state, have existed for millenia. 

Currencies *backed by gold* are a relatively new invention. Older societies used precious medals as currencies. They replaced it with paper money because using precious metals sucks.


>And you say there is NO CHANCE we will EVER return to such a system? Seriously? Global fiat currency is very new. Only since 1971. Things like gold have been tested by time.

You should learn some basic history. The *state* has had their own currency in pretty much all western societies since Roman times or before. I think we will use fiat because its far superior to a precious metal backed currency, but I can guarantee that as long as there are states, there will be state backed currency.


>Not yet. It's also fairly straightforward and easy to use if you have a smartphone. Works just like Apple pay. Not difficult.

That's a signal from the market that we already have enough grains and that there's more demand for other crops. Once people have enough grain they start desiring more exotic luxury items.

If we were running low on grains then the price of grains would go up and more farmers would switch to growing grains.

I really don't see where the harm from too much supply is meant to be in this instance.

Excepting in cases of market interference (e.g. the government set a maximum price, or is subsidizing one crop too much), then low price is an indicator of abundance. Abundant food is not a problem.

"Thanks, that's so nice of you to read my rambling text...

Taxation: right now the US has decided that cryptos are a commodity, like aluminum ore. If you mine it, you get taxed at the market value of spot prices for the day, if you sell it, you have to pay on your basis etc. If you're in Japan, I hear it's a currency. So like going between dollars, euros and yen, you don't pay on ""gains"". I wish that bitcoin had been defined as a currency. In other places they can do different things. See your local tax office ... 

Can government shut bitcoin down, yes, that's one of the existential risks that goes into everyone's calculation of getting wiped out.  

Getting your speculation/investment nullified or wiped out is a big downside. Another risk is that people that like government power and security (aka ""Statists"") are going to put a mark on bitcoiners and deny them jobs, turn them into criminals etc. It's possible right? So not a non-factor.

There are other risks, let me find a good link .... (while I searched for that, I just realized that the FAQ has good info -- https://bitcoin.org/en/faq )

Here's FINRA's page on bitcoin risks:

https://www.finra.org/investors/highlights/what-you-should-know-about-bitcoin

That's pretty middle-of-the-road advice on the risks. I don't think I could quote a more mainstream trustworthy source, for you or your dad?

If I can just add, I think that the biggest risks in bitcoin are these:

1) It's not as anonymous as people think - so privacy centric coins have some value by that defect in bitcoin
2) And it might not be as programmable as a money as people think - so that's giving value to Ethereum; via contracts people use cookie cutter contracts to spin off a myriad of altcoins on top of Ethereum.
3) There's not a direct benefit to a passive holder - gives value to Dash and proof of stake coins 
4) There's no obvious way to peg bitcoin to other coins in order to suck the value out of the other coins. Meaning, if it was easier to create peg pools between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, then bitcoin would drain all the fucking value out of them (because it would be the largest and most liquid coin). But since it can't quite do that yet, and it's getting closer to doing this every day, then well .. it's possible that other coins might still exist, but not have anything other than notional value, relative to bitcoin, and if bitcoin is accumulating all the value, it would start to become (or kind of already is) the ""unit of account"" for altcoins. Lots of alts are only for sale in bitcoin, so their ""unit of account"" is already bitcoin. 

EDIT: shoot wanted to add one  more thing about buying cars or houses with bitcoin. The sellers of things right now are still usually measuring their wealth, and pricing things, in a unit of account like dollars. So conceptually, they are converting dollars to bitcoin and back in their heads when they think about how much things are worth. This sub is an example, as it enjoys bitcoin $9k and bitcoin $10k. They are measuring in their heads the purchasing power of their bitcoins in dollars or euros or yen because that's what their debts are in, salaries are in, savings are in, and what the goods they buy are in.

Cars and houses can be sold for bitcoin or any cryptocurrency pretty easily. There are companies out there like Bitpay that will act as middlemen. They let the companies accept bitcoin without having to understand it. Bitpay will take bitcoins, give the sellers dollars (or a mix of dollars and bitcoins, if the company wants to have a little bitcoin on the side.). 

Now the government LOVES to track financial movements. So they will be keen to know who is buying cars and houses (or gold and jewelry) or darker things like financing terrorism, drugs etc. It's my understanding that real estate can be purchased in the US *without* having to disclose where the money came from. It just looks really  suspicious on your taxes if you own fancy houses and have no income. You have to show proof that you have the funds, but you don't have to say where it came from. I'm not a real estate attorney. (Quick google:  https://www.homes.com/question/31743/For-a-Cash-Buy-do-you-have-to-show-where-the-money-comes-from-in-order-to-purchase-Possible-inheritence-or-awarded-settlement-from-Job/   )     Eh, it's kind of a loophole, but not one that concerns me.

Terrorist financing is just a boogeyman. To take a real world example, I didn't realize that the IRA (Irish whatever) had people in the US that bought them guns and sent them money. So that's basically supporting terrorism or liberation or whatever you want to believe. I stay a million miles away from violence. I think that a purely super anonymous cryptocurrency could be used to buy or fund all kinds of things. But I think it's important to remember that - take a group like ISIS - they're out there (or were) out there in the field doing horrible things. If the government wants to go organize air strikes or something or war and a ground invasion to take them on, that would still happen. If Saudis used cryptocurrency to anonymously fund them, I don't see how that changes anything. Secret supporters of things have always existed. See: secret societies.

It's more useful... at the moment. It is untrue to say that it is *inherently* more useful. It is more useful at the moment because it is widely adopted. Given a scenario where Bitcoin sees mass adoption, it is difficult to argue that fiat money is *inherently* more useful because the entire use is derived from its current status of wide adoption. 99% of the fiat currencies that exist serve no use except as museum artifacts.

>Additionally, we will most likely see states and financial institutions strip the most useful parts of the technology and start to use them.

">How is too much valuable stuff a problem.

Because it isn't valuable by way of being so common. Consider the water and diamonds example. Everyone might need water, but it just isn't as valuable as diamonds because it is so abundant.

Wholegrain suffers this, which is why farmers use cash crops until the other market stabilizes.

As more, newer technology comes out, previously expensive goods become redundant and easier to buy. It does not mean that these aren't net losses because of waste.

Things which don't depreciate are land, until land itself becomes de-privatized, which may never happen without serious revolutionary ideas (communism), and even then, it wont be made completely public. Borders are a hindrance in the modern age to most people, but they're not going away.

"Money *itself*, all money ever invented and used, is/was a bubble. 

Take gold for example. The Incas were just rolling in the stuff. It was practically plastic to them. They used it to make jewellery and ...not much else as it is very soft. They didn't value it *anywhere near* as much as Europeans did at the time. 

Gold is, essentially, a useless rock. You can't eat it. You are very limited in what you can do with it.

Until it was used as money in Europe & Asia.

And this kind of ""just happened"". Nobody decreed it. No empires or kingdoms can create gold. It was just decided upon as something fungible, rare, divisible and transportable enough that it could be used as *a form* of money. 

Before and during that time spices were also commonly used as money. And shells.

When the Spaniards arrived in South America the amount of gold dripping everywhere blew their minds. The Incas *could not understand* what the Europeans saw in gold. When the Incas asked why they valued it so much the Europeans' reply was something not unlike ""It is an ailment for a disease of our hearts we all have.""

The point is all *forms* of money are a bubble. They start out worth nothing, gold was once worthless as were shells, and then as they are used as currency, a store of value, and if popular enough a unit of measure, they increase in value rapidly. People want it because other people want it.

Most *forms* of money have been around so long nobody alive remembers the initial inflation of the bubble, so it is never even considered a bubble. It's just ""money"". It just has value because it always has.

"Economics 101 is fine and great for teaching why managed currency is so vital to our economy, but try showing me one real-world example of a well-managed currency?  

The problem with the dollar is it's the unsecured liability of the US government, which is bankrupt. In the years to come that's going to become very obvious, with catastrophic consequences for the average American.

How can you get ahead in the world when you have to save a depreciating asset? That's why in these third world countries the average guy keeps falling further and further behind, because all he can save is the local currency, and the currency consistently turns into toilet paper, so he's always behind the eight ball.

The same is going to happen in the US on a much grander scale. It's going to be much more serious, because even in all these countries smarter people try to save dollars, they don't save pesos or kwacha or ringgit, they don't save these horrible currencies. They try to get hold of US dollars. When the dollar is devastated, they're going to blame Americans for their currency losing value. This has all kinds of bad consequences.

The dollar is going to cease being the world's reserve currency sometime in the next decade; I'm confident of that. The Chinese are making a lot of progress with the yuan. The euro, however, is going to cease to exist. The European Union is going to break up. Europe has all kinds of problems.

We have a president who appears to want a weak dollar: What he's really doing is destroying American savings and making imported goods more expensive.

"Sure, but in your response you've mentioned *government*, *borders* and *bank*. All of these are figments of the collective human psyche. They don't really exist, except in our minds. Ditto money.

Government: Take a photo of it. Wait 10 years and take another. It's completely different, and yet the same. The only way a government can cease to exist is if its *country* ceases to exist, and a country is just another entity that only exists in the collective human psyche. Ask a duck that flies north for winter (southern hemisphere perspective) how many countries it flies over.

Borders: See *country*.

Bank: Not unlike *government*. You could replace every single aspect of a bank, its staff, its buildings, its logos, its customers, and it would still be the same bank.

"It's spendable. Technically people are always in some ratio of assets - like sum up your assets. You might have a house, car, student loans, credit card debts, cash, and bitcoin.

If bitcoin keeps going up, then yes, by Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good), you will spend your worst money which is cash.

(Quick Gresham's Law definition: In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.)

So when you see something for sale in cash (VISA probably) or bitcoin over the Internet, it doesn't matter which one you use, but what's happening to the ratio of one or the other. People know bitcoin is better.

I would gladly take bitcoin over cash if I was selling things online. I don't even think I'd try to go with VISA. Just sell stuff via OpenBazaar and use bitcoin.

"**Intrinsic and extrinsic properties**

An intrinsic property is a property of a system or of a material itself or within. It is independent of how much of the material is present and is independent of the form of the material, e.g., one large piece or a collection of small particles. Intrinsic properties are dependent mainly on the chemical composition or structure of the material.

A property that is not essential or inherent is called an extrinsic property.

"Oh sure, back up start over. I didn't mean to come off with snark.

Okay so say first of all that cryptocurrencies are not rare, start with that. There was a website around, where I think for something like .02 bitcoin, someone would give you source code and a working gui wallet for your own coin. You could give it a name, a logo, your choice of proof of work algorithms, blocksizes, all kinds of parameters, then you had a coin. It was that easy.

Now in the world of ordinary dollars and euros and raffle tickets, you too can take a piece of paper and write ""$5 dollars"" on it, and see if anyone will give you money for it or find it valuable.

You can also make a spreadsheet, and just track how much money people had. There's a joke subreddit that did that. /r/whowillbuildtheroads/ and the coin is /r/LivingWageCoin/  - its all a joke.

Next, you could be the Fed, and you can just decide how much money different members should have and how much debt the banks should hold, and all kinds of interesting monetary policy. It's over my head, but I've come around to the idea that maybe the US would be better off which different regional dollars. That would help make parts of the country more competitive. Eh, moving on...

You can fork a coin, by just choosing to do it. Your fork starts with the initial history (or starts over  from scratch) and has whatever rules going forward that you want. If you don't change the mining algorithm, then people can choose to mine your coin or the old one it forked from. They just have to decide which one has a brigher future.

Next, network effects. If I have a fax machine, and you don't, then it's not very useful. If we both have a fax machine, it's good for us. As more people join in, this fax thing gets more and more useful.

If I have cryptocurrency A, and you have cryptocurrency B, we're at an impasse unless one of us will trade A for B or vice versa at some exchange rate. If cryptocurrency A is constantly growing because of random hacks and people can make up money undetected, that's going to show up in the exchange rate with cryptocurrency B which is more secure or has a slower emission rate. Since B is obviously better, some people will sell A and hold B. Others will wait for a good time to sell A and buy B. Others will hold A and hold out hope for future improvement of their position.

I don't want to ramble but ... if you make a fork of a coin, what about it makes it better than the previous coin? Because we have to do some work to switch to it or even to make things compatible. So you have to have a compelling case. 

Some of these forks are premined, where like the person doing the fork secretly mines 1 to 10% ahead of time, and releases code and a binary for CPU/GPU mining that's borked and inefficient, while the forker secretly mines on a more efficient binary. Issues like that I think made Monero fork from (Bytecoin?) 

Anyway, you could fork bitcoin and give yourself lots of it, change a parameter like block size. Why would anyone join you?

Now in the bitcoin cash drama, that's a fork of bitcoin, and the larger blocks made old business models that relied on tiny fees viable again - like Satoshi Dice. Since it's very compatible with bitcoin, except for the block size, they could restart their out of date business model. So that's a viable fork, in a way.

The market is deciding, since most people and banks operate in the realm of fiat currencies, everyone right now sees not a lot of choice besides buying cryptocurrencies using whatever fiat they have. But some people pay in altcoins or bitcoin to get other coins and speculate on their future value. That's like anything.

Cryptocurrencies base value is that they are like a slowly growing hard drive that you pay to have digitally signed messages recorded into it forever.

Right now we are pretending that bitcoins are like money. Because of their divisibility a bitcoin (limit 21 million) will probably give around a million smaller addresses. I personally think that in 20 years, the block chain will be a huge number of digitally signed messages ~ 1 petabyte in size. Most of these things will probably be colored coins - meaning standing in for other things, or other second layer solutions settling out or opening. 

Don't freak out too much, a petabyte will fit in your watch.

Yes, I agree that is the million dollar question. But wouldn't you expect an asset to continue growing in value if it's something you believe in?

The smartphones adoption rate happened in a shorter time than the adoption of electricity, television, or even the internet. 

bitcoin is working, and its not like anything before, these are all just analogies. thats why it's important to focus on fundamentals, like adoption rate versus supply.

">And the rest, the millions of mainstream folks? What do they get out of running a resource-intensive process that - no matter what block size - needs to be always on and eats up storage, bandwidth and electricity? Why wouldn't they use a slim SPV or mobile wallet that costs them nothing to run and is MUCH more convenient? Or just keep their funds sitting in exchanges, as I'd bet most of the price meme posters here do despite all the warnings? Do you really think keeping blocks at 1MB will make a difference in their decision?

They need to be run by someone. Without a large number of distributed and decentralised nodes verifying bitcoin transactions independently, there is no point to bitcoin. Without that network, it is just a highly inefficient version of PayPal. A couple of thousand tech geeks and businesses concentrated in urban areas in developed countries are not going to withstand a government crackdown. We need a network that is going to survive no matter what government in the world bans running bitcoin nodes. If the US government declares bitcoin and running nodes illegal, you are still going to be able to send transactions to whoever you want whenever you want because nodes in South America and the Middle East are verifying them and relaying them to miners. That is the point of bitcoin.

> I'm sure the geeks, the privacy guys, the businesses and enthusiasts who are willing to run a 1MB full node will also have the resources to run 2, 4 or more MB blocks, no matter where they live.

I live in Tokyo with some of the best internet infrastructure in the world and would not be able to keep my node running if blocks were 8MB. There is no way most of the people running nodes now would be able to handle 8MB blocks with the current level of bitcoin transaction traffic.

Correct, they're in control of something much more important: Food. And yet for some reason we don't need bread neutrality, if a baker is being a dick we just go to another baker.

>So with that in mind, its imperative that the internet remains open and free in order for the First amendment to stay relevant

I agree, and increasing government control of the internet certainly doesn't achieve that end.

>because you might as well be saying you're ok with a baker deciding what you can and cant speak about to your friends.

I'm ok with that because I know the days are numbered of any service provider that tries that shit. I'd be much more concerned if the government had the power to step in and prevent competition from replacing them.
