Scalability is fixed by using another more scalable, lower fee currency. I would like to think of Ethereum as the cash of the future because it's much more suited for that on a large scale.

"Government action can definitely cause bumps in the road for cryptocurrencies. However, here are some other aspects to take into consideration:

1. Governments have not just started to act. China has increased regulations around Bitcoin a number of times already, and Bitcoin continue to strive.  The same with the US and the EU. The recent China-ban only set the price back to what was the all time high only a few weeks earlier. 

2. By now there are a lot of important people - high politicians and rich businesspeople among them - who are heavily invested in Bitcoin. They will use their influence to curb any too draconian measures.

3. The very reason government might want to control Bitcoin is the reason they can't. Bitcoin is decentralized without single points of failure. Government actions might hamper usage, but can't stop it.

4. Cryptocurrencies is a whole new finance sector with a lot of new use cases, and as such it brings economical growth. The countries who embrace the new technology probably stands to gain a lot. And as this becomes obvious, more and more countries will adopt a positive stance to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

"I would say that the most likely deflationary spiral event would be a mistake found in the crypto, or some part of the algorithm, like if you could find a shortcut in the proof-of-work algorithm, it could undercut the value, as miners would implement the better version.  BUT difficulty would eventually adjust back up, so as long as the work isn't a 0 or something other futzing about with the system allows hacks.

I mean honestly right now 'DNS hacking' would be the best way to go, if you attack the dns providers for a pool, to point to a pool you run, ... well....

Even for the smaller pools that could easily be ~10grand in your pocket.

Obviously the DNS hacking won't make to much of a dent because, I'd assume the dns lookup is done not that often, but I could be wrong.  I was just conjecturing a possible scenario.

I am praxxing here, so keep that in mind. I would say that once bitcoin is mined out and people believe that it will keep on rising in value and so they will try to hold the currency, there will come a point where it just won't rise anymore, people will lose faith in the currency and it will sharply go down. Obviously, as long as it has an intrinsic use, e.g. drug trade, it will be still worth something.;2;1;False;Ligaco;dnljccn;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"I am using bubble to mean a self-sustaining confluence of speculative wealth that is growing more rapidly than the foundation upon which it is supposedly based. The ""bubble"" being the shiny veneer of the bitcoin-to-$ rate, and the gaping empty air underneath that veneer being what should be a whole marketplace of goods and services using the bitcoin infrastructure. (Admittedly, for a while, bitcoin was being used as a real black-market currency, but I think it has since been dethroned by Monero as the preferred crypto for anonymity.)

Ponzi, for instance had discovered a real way of generating wealth by basically gaming the currency exchange system. However his ""scheme"" was that he convinced people that he was able to generate *vastly* more wealth with this method than was actually possible. Some people probably realized that he was paying off early investors with the investment of later investors, but thought they were early enough in the game to be one of the few lucky winners.

 The foundation of bitcoin's value is that it is in many ways like cash, but better because it is digital.

">What is that yellow rock thing called again? That people have used as a speculative investment only for thousands of years? Can’t remember what happened to it, does it still hold value?

There was a large speculative bubble in gold. It burst. It nearly halved in value between 2010 and 2013. There's likely still a bubble although its not as bad as it was. And that's a precious metal that has scientific and industrial uses and is a finite physical material.

Do you think your bitcoins can't halve in value? Bitcoin does nothing that half a dozen other crypto currencies can't do. There's nothing to stop it from being completely abandoned as a currency and replaced by another crypto currency.

Gold will never be completely abandoned because it has certain irreplaceable properties as a fundamental element of the universe.

Very few people are actually using bitcoin as a currency. It's only worth $4,000 now because people think it will be even more in a few months. As soon as people think it will no longer grow in value then all those people who bought bitcoins is an investment (which is most people who have bitcoins) will sell them.

>Have had people telling me that for more than 3 years now, we will see what happens. But so far people like you have been proven wrong every time. ;)

The gold bubble took much longer than 3 years to grow. If you think 3 years of growth means it can't be a bubble then you really shouldn't be gambling any money on bitcoin.

> Me depositing more than I use, and more people like me doing the same.

That's not how currency works.

There are hundreds of millions of people depositing hundreds of billions of dollars into their bank account every month, that does not magically make dollars quadruple in value in a year.

"The value of bitcoin can be measured in many ways. A full bitcoin is worth about $4k right now, but there are smaller units that are worth much, much less.

1 mBTC is currently worth $4. 1 Satoshi is worth $0.00004. Which of these units do use to compare to the dollar to decide which one is valued more? The correct answer is none of them.

To determine which is valued more, you have to compare the total value of all currently circulating bitcoins/USD. Compare bitcoin's market cap in USD to the amount of USD in circulation. It's imperfect but it's how you have to do it.

Because of bitcoin's limited cap of 21 million coins, it doesn't take too many people to make the price skyrocket. Supply is low, so demand doesn't have to be high to make the price high.

"I think we can make a parallel with the Internet and old media. Old media used to control what we could see, then Internet disrupts it allowing information to flow freely and decentralized. Even though it is better than the past model, it brings whole new issues. We can now be manipulated by our bubble filters and fake news¹ from both sides. We're now seeing how fake news is being financed by the old groups we were trying to get rid of.

I don't think the point is government not controlling it, laws are what enables a country to function as a nation instead of a tribe. The point he's making is fractional reserve banking.

"All currencies (and anything with value) hold value because people think they do, of that makes sense.

Bitcoins have that value due to being anti big brothery afaik, hard to trace or whatever, the more people value that the more they're worth. Also there's the fact that people think it will be worth more in the future so it's worth more now due to people buying it purely to sell later, it comes down to supply and demand, the supply is finite and decreasing in speed with every one mined but demand fluctuates, and eventually when the supply is emptied because of how the maths works it will probably collapse.";1;0;False;JoelMahon;dnlbc8b;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"My understanding is, there is a fixed amount of bitcoins that can ever exist. They are generated via a logrithmic function, such that there will only ever be 21million bitcoins.

The amount rewarded is halved each time. Such that if you mine early, you get way more rewards than when you mine later. Like, exponentially more.

Thats why its pretty obviously a ponzi scheme. Its idea is to pay out to people who get in early, while people who get in late are  the ones who get suckered.

"Let me distinguish between bitcoin

 A) as a shared software tool (the technology itself) and 

B) as a word for the value of a single bitcoin as an exchange rate between a 1 on the ledger, and the world's fiat currencies. 

Bitcoin, the technology, is of course not a scam. It is good for sending bitcoin here and there, quickly, immutably etc. But the idea that Bitcoin will be the single crypto-currency to replace cash worldwide, I think is unlikely. The price of bitcoin currently, is not *primarily* driven by the fact that actual vendors of goods and services are adopting bitcoin - if they were, that would be great, because then bitcoin would provide a way for me to send my Aunt in Germany bitcoin which she could use to buy furniture without either of us losing anything to bank fees, exchange rates etc. However the price of bitcoin is being driven by speculators, speculating on themselves being smarter than other speculators, which *is* a bubble.

You are right. My response was based on the idea that to 99% of people involved, a bubble 'feels' like a scam, a small minority end up profiting wildly, and the rest sink. Since bubbles can be shaken and moved by big players in whatever industry they exist in, and are subject to tweets and rumors about the future actions of those big players, in many ways those big players do get an upper hand in what is *theoretically* a less centralized process of upward wealth-redistribution.;1;0;False;graciousgroob;dnlja8q;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"""Because it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets, bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, once a sudden drop in prices has occurred. ""

Economists in fact avoid using the term ""bubble"" with things other than stocks, as it can't be technically defined, nor is ""intrinsic value"" even a coherent concept, but instead a term used in finance to indicate  historic ratios between stock price and p/e. Bubble is especially incoherent in regards to commodities.

Are bitcoin's rises and contractions very similar to past stock bubbles (and community over-exuberance)? Of course, but you're not showing why that matters and you're not showing evidence or reason of why these bubble-like cycles are bad or unsustainable or portend failure of bitcoin.

Bitcoin has had almost everything imaginable thrown at it over more than 8 years. If you can imagine something else that is novel that is likely to happen and show why you think it will cause a massive break with bitcoin's price cycles (which include booms and busts, but rarely crashing below previous crashes' lows, and characterized by slowly decreasing volatility), then I'm all ears. But the onus is on you...

Bitcoin and its proponents are no longer on the defensive. Bitcoin has proven itself. It is your assessment which is suspect now.

Please [read and educate yourself on why bitcoin is different than stocks or tulips, and can't be assessed in the same way](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6u14b3/why_bitcoin_is_the_way_that_it_is_or_how_i) .  you can't assess bitcoin without understanding money, network goods, and the coordination problems which plague the production of money on a market.

">the internet is clearly the only public global computer network. 

That's actually a really interesting assertion. Let's talk about that for a second?

How do you define ""public global computer network""? Is it by the physical infrastructure? If so, there really isn't a single ""internet"", as the infrastructure globally is owned by hundreds of completely independant companies, municipalities, and nations.

If it's by protocol, then what about I2P? Tor? Freenet? Usenet? All of these are completely separate from the standard clear internet, sometimes with bridges to the clear internet. These bridges are very similar to the physical bridges between the segments of physical infrastructure individually owned and run around the world.

In either case, it's interesting to think about how all of these network implementations are inspired by and iterations on the original ARPAnet. Were it not for the US Gov and a collections of Universities in North America pushing for interconnections and data sharing for their mainframes, none of these other technologies would have arisen.

And honestly, that's interesting, because none of the current implementations are all that similar to ARPAnet, though their common origin is evident. All of the current protocols and segments of infrastructure work together, and create the now-ubiquitous (yet ambiguously named) ""internet"". It's not a single thing, it's a collective whole built on an original and long-since-irrelevant idea.

Similar to how the blockchain and the first currency to use it is a very original idea, yet we already have a variety of implementations building on that starting point.

I expect that bitcoin will continue existing for a while, but to say that the other cryptos don't stand a chance or that the blockchain and Bitcoin are basically the same thing, especially when using the internet as a comparison, is kind of shortsighted.

We as a species of talky, social engineers are bound to iterate and replace any new technology of value. It's just a matter of time.

"If you can derive the new private key from the old one, and using a quantum computer I can calculate the legacy private key from the legacy public key, then you have solved nothing at all.

With ECDSA the private key is king. If I can get that, I am the owner, full stop. With quantum computers I can get the private key from the public. So I can be the owner of any bitcoins ever, and I will continue to be the owner of those coins indefinitely in the future, as anything that you need the legacy private key for, I can just do myself.

And if you think this won't become an issue you are sadly mistaken. Quantum computers will happen. The theory is sound, it has been tested, and they are in development. We are still many years away from making useful QCs by most estimates, but they will happen. It's literally just a manufacturing and scaling problem now, as QCs don't become better than classical computers until around the 4k q-bit range, and we are right now making them at about the 32 q-bit range.

Trust me, I studied cryptography in college, there literally can't be an easy solution to this problem, because if there was it would mean ECDSA is broken already.

The same properties that make the private/public keypair system useful to Bitcoin are the ones that make an upgrade to that system impossible to do in what would be considered a ""soft fork""

It would need to be a massive hard fork, basically rewriting most of the Bitcoin codebase to work with a second signing algorithm and address algorithm, and every single person would need to preemptively move their coins to a new address before QCs become powerful enough to break their keys.

The fighting on which new algorithm to pick would take years on its own, probably fracturing bitcoin into multiple groups in the process. Then there is the implementation, the testing, teaching the public how to secure their keys, making sure every single address is upgraded, then either forcibly ""burning"" all coins that are in all addresses via a code change at a specific block making them impossible to spend, or bracing for the inevitable flood of previously ""burned"" coins which will crash the price (not that big of a deal to be honest, but it will cause a lot of commotion)

My concern is that this is a pressing issue. We need to get started on a solution to this NOW if we want it to be ready in 10 years. And if estimates put QCs at 20 years out, all it takes is one big breakthrough and we are now racing manufacturing of these machines to get a code change out and everyone's coins moved before it comes online.";3;1;False;Klathmon;dnl2osw;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

The term derives from the Latin fiat (""let it be done"") used in the sense of an order or decree. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity).

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

"> What is the cost of producing one bitcoin?


About 1500 dollars or something, but I don’t have time to calculate it right now. You will need to look at the current difficulty that miners are mining against.


> What is the cost of producing a cryptocurrency that does everything bitcoin does but better?


Creating a cryptocurrency is like 2 hours work if you know what you’re doing, so that won’t cost you a lot. The difficult thing is to get people using it.


> that does everything bitcoin does but better?


“better”, English is better than Dutch (which is my own langue). But still some people prefer to speak Dutch. That’s just the way it is.


One could argue Pepsi is better than Coke Cola, but still people drink Cola because its more well known. But some people also drink Pepsi.


There doesn’t have to be 1 winner. Bitcoin will decentralize everything, even itself.


> How does that make it a good currency? If my wages could halve in a month it would make it very difficult to plan expenses.


It needs time, it’s already much more stable than it was 8 years ago. In 20 years it will probably be ready for the average working man to use it as a stable currency. Although Bitcoin is already rather stable compared to currencies like the Syrian lira for example.


> Why invest in the largest most valuable cryptocurrency that doesn't need any help? Why not use that money to support new startup cryptocurrencies to encourage their use?


Because I believe it will be better for the entire crypto movement if we have one very large stable cryptocurrency that everyone knows. If people choose to use many different currencies it will take much longer for us to get to our end goal (but we will achieve it nonetheless it will just take 50 years instead of 20). So I prefer to keep it strong. Plus I don’t support any of the more centralized cryptocurrencies.


But I do own some Monero and Litecoins.


> Dollars haven't halved or doubled in value for 10 years, let alone done so in 2 weeks.


Dollars and Euro’s are devided among the entire population and accepted as a method of payment everywhere. It will take decades before Bitcoin ever gets to that point, until then Bitcoin will be rather unstable.


> No one is speculating on dollars because they aren't consistently increasing in value.


Lol, apparently you have never heard of the forex market. People gamble on the Euro and the Dollar all the time.


> The central bank deliberately tries to keep the value relatively stable because a volatile currency would disrupt the economy.


Like Zimbabwe and Venezuela?


I rather trust math than the government.


> dollars haven't halved or doubled in value for 10 years


Well actually it did: http://www.forexblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Euro-Dollar-5-Year-Chart-2005-20101.bmp

"Plenty. What most impressed me is its self sustaining logic. Nothing else I know of requires only that people act in their own interest to function properly in this. Game theory in economics typically is incompletely implemented or describes why something must fail. This describes why it must work. 

It's a 10 minute read though. If you think you understand bitcoin well you have obviously commited more than 10 minutes in the past, and if you are willing to spend any time researching, it needs to include reading the whitepaper. It's an amazing piece of writing, and is worth a read even if you never use Bitcoin.

"Don't believe what? That I've studied or worked in jobs related to economics? Millions of people have. This is 10s of thousands of pages reading for most.

That I've read the whitepaper? It's a few pages. That I believe it's the best piece of economics writing I've ever encountered? It's an opinion, not a fact. And you are speaking to someone in a Bitcoin sub. I'm more likely to hold this opinion than most. I recognise that some of the earliest papers on classical economics that I read in university might actually be better, but they are concepts we have internalized too much to recognise how groundbreaking they were.

That my belief in the brilliance of the whitepaper dictates that Bitcoin will be a success? It doesn't. I started looking at Bitcoin because I heard you could buy it in one place and sell in my home country for a profit. This made it interesting, even though I was 100% sure it was nonsense, despite knowing nothing about it. I read the whitepaper a year ago and was blown away. But I still didn't trust the implementation. I didn't understand cryptography or the protocols (and still mostly don't). I've only started to believe in Bitcoin in the last few months. But the amount it has grown is making it a lot easier to believe in.

If you know anything about economics (doesn't even need to be much), read the whitepaper. If you see the logic, research some more. The economics make sense to me, maybe they will to you too. If the fundamentals of the system don't impress you once you have a reasonable understanding of them don't invest. Past performance does not guarantee future results. This would be a bubble. But also, don't do as I did and dismiss the best performing investment in history because you are convinced you know everything about about it before you actually do your research though.

"**Gresham's law**

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

">Gold has value because people buy it, it’s that simple.

If someone could produce gold from scratch for 10 cents a kilo, who would buy gold for $1,000 an ounce? Gold has the value it does because people buy it **and** its expensive to produce. If someone came up with a much cheaper way of producing gold then what people would pay for it would reduce.

"I can see where you’re coming from, but I can’t agree. By that logic, anything used for barter is a “currency.” Eggs, firewood, cars, bananas, etc. can all be considered “currency”  because you can trade all of them for other things under the right circumstances. 

It’s a fair definition, but a useless one. If there’s to be a line drawn between commodity and currency it has to be with how frequently/widely it’s accepted within any given community, and how often it’s used as a medium through which commodities are exchanged. (eg: You sell a car for dollars, then use the dollars to buy something else. You don’t sell dollars for a car, then use the car to buy something else.)

In both of these respects Bitcoin fails heartily, so it isn’t *really* a currency in pretty much any community.

"Well first off, it's totally open and available for anyone to read if they're interested via [the Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

But again, that same argument can be applied to the US government. Most people couldn't tell you off the top of their head exactly *why* the US government has its power, not many ppl can list off the many treaties and alliances and tariffs and taxes and various things that make our economy strong, the formula the federal reserve uses to determine how many notes to create each year, etc which in turn gives the USD power. I would guess less than 1/100 US citizens can tell you *why* the US is a world power, they just know that it *is* a power.  People are still happy relying on the government for their currency. Cryptocurrency is no different, if you *want* to understand it the information is all out there and the code is open to view, but it's not required to be able to use it.

An even more important point here is that just because you don't understand it, doesn't equate to it not being secure or true. Many people in the world smarter than you or I have tried their hardest to break Bitcoin, and it hasn't happened because it's not possible. You're using the internet right now, could you tell me how DNS, TCP/IP, and the many technologies that power it work? Probably not, but who cares? It works. Your bank accounts, credit cards, etc. all use the internet every day to facilitate their infrastructure, do you care if you know how that works when you swipe your credit card at Walmart?

    Just saying...
Bitcoin is not a commodity item. It is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever. And I don't mean revolutionary as in ""oh, it's a new thing"", but int he sense of ""this will actually start a revolution. There is a world before and after Bitcoin."" Using it as a form of currency is just one application of it, but that alone is so revolutionary that if we were talking physics, we would be discussing Einstein's breakthrough with the theory of relativity. To put it simply, it is *a huge fucking deal*.

Bitcoin is not just another currency, it is a whole new step in the evolution of money. It is not a trend, like we've all suddenly stated to use [tulips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) instead of real money. And it is not a modern hobby like Pokémon Go. The significance of Bitcoin is more like the invention of the printing press, electricity, or penicillin. It's a revolution that will affect the whole planet and it is unstoppable.

Sure, owning Bitcoin right now is like being the first person in the world with a phone, or being on the internet when it was new. There's not a lot you can do yet, but you can be sure that there is no going back from this. Technology doesn't die, it evolves. There is only forward for Bitcoin.

If you think Bitcoin is a commodity, you have not been paying attention. Bitcoin is not the fax machine or the phone, it is the very communication technology that allows them to exist. And it's not a new currency, it is a whole new technology that allows for the transfer of value to happen in the world in a way that has never been possible before in the entire history of money and mankind.

So, asking what the value of Bitcoin is is like asking why you should invest in green energy when you have a diesel car. Sure, you can't really buy groceries or pay your bills with Bitcoin just yet, but you could not do much with stocks from Apple Inc in 1976 either.";0;3;False;frankichiro;dnl5gh4;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"I am already short 2 bitcoins, and hoping it goes up more so I can get a larger stake - shorting 8 bitcoins is my ideal goal.

You have some points and some just ramblings that contradict your actual points. But breaking it down it seems you are confused in how to value a currency. Basically it boils down to arbitrage. Let's say country A produces 100 cars every year and has a money supply of 10k kronor, whereas country B also produces 100 cars every year but with a money supply of 100k kronors. Assuming producing costs are the same in both countries, and disregarding any credit rate considerations, then it's clear that one krona from country A should be worth 10 kronors from country B. People of both nations value a car equally much and are both willing to spend an equal amount of their income on cars. If the exchange rate was 5 kronors in country B for 1 krona in country A, then everyone in country B could just exchange money to country A's krona and buy a car at 50% discount. And what happens when lots of people want to buy country A's kronors? The price rises. How much? Until the exchange rate is 10 kronors for 1 krona in country A. And this is the fundamental value of a currency, it depends on the services and product that are DENOTED in that currency. Basically the euro can't sink too low since products and services produces in those countries would be too cheap, and any effective market would not allow this. 

And this is the difference with bitcoin. Nothing is denoted in how many bitcoins it costs. Sure you can buy stuff with bitcoin, but the price is always denoted in another currency, and then checks how many bitcoins are needed for that amount of fiat. So if bitcoins halves in the coming month, there would be no arbitrage opportunities, since any store accepting bitcoin would double the amount of bitcoins needed to buy the product. This is why fiat currencies have intrinstic value, whereas bitcoin does not in that respect, at least at the moment.

Obviously it would be hard, but if you know the money supply, the productivity, the rates of any given country, you should basically be able to calculate the exchange rates to other currencies. I hope this example was clear.

That's why adoption is the fundamentals of bitcoin, and preferably products denoted in bitcoin. I agree speculation is inevitable, and healthy infact, but based on what I wrote I think valuation is too far of fundamentals for this to be sustainable.

Its not that I think that bitcoin's lead is assured...no, I expect markets to shift even to new money eventually; and bitcoin isn't even money yet.  But I think you're seeing ethereum, for example, doing so well; not just as a function of stealing some of bitcoin's market share; but because blockchain tech is creating new value and ethereum is filling a niche that bitcoin doesn't, and bitcoin is evolving towards filling the base-money role, where ethereum probably won't.

Anyhow, its not that I'm even contending that bitcoin can't fail...I'm simply saying that at this point, the onus is definitely on skeptics and detractors to explain plausible scenarios to undo what bitcoin has already succeeded at.  We have no cause nowadays to be defensive about it. These people can eat their words as their wealth erodes and ours increases.

">It's a bubble simply because it has no fundamentals to back it up. 

Fundamentals such as earnings or company net worth? Of course not! Its not a stock. Fundamentals like uses of a commodity (e.g. gold in electronics)? Of course not! Its (a unit token of bitcoin) current utility is more limited to the bearing of smart contracts and as a share of a valuable (censorship-resistant) payment network...but bitcoin is different than stocks or gold or wheat: bitcoin is a proto-money. It is a good which has little value as token which just a few thousand people use....but immense value as a network good: as money.

>99% of bitcoin's value

Really?  How have you calculated this? I'm not even getting on you for making a specific number claim. I take your meaning and understand that you mean ""the vast majority"". But you're still out of your depth here. You do not know what comprises bitcoin's value (nobody does, except for their own valuations, because value is subjective to the individual), nor do you know what share of it's current price is due to what you are incoherently referring to as ""fundamentals"", and what is due to ""speculation""...which is also non-sensical and incoherent: speculation happens when people place a value (or future valuation) upon something which is different than its current price.

> come from speculation of future fundamentals to back it up, which may or may not come true.

Correct. How else can or should a proto-money market operate: Bitcoin is not yet money. It will be extremely valuable when/if it is money. It's hard to get everyone to agree on a price and distribute the token to people who do not see its future value...speculation helps this (again, read the link I posted in the prior comment for more on this). Speculation and bubble-like activity are not only inevitable, but indispensable. Bitcoin has little or none of what you are calling ""fundamentals"" (so of course 99% of its price reflects speculation on the future), it mostly just has its future utility as a fully actualized money.  This is and has always been bitcoin's value proposition. It's fundamentals, then, are its good monetary properties and censorship-resistant payment network. Neither you, nor I, nor anyone, have any idea what it's current price *should* be, nor what its future price needs to be, in order to support the liquidity and depth of a money.

>If you think fundamentals will catch up to the current crazy valuation, then it's not a bubble, otherwise it is. 

Reread above paragraph. Its not coherent to think in terms of ""catching up"".

>In my opinion adaption is wayyy too slow to catch up with the valuation, hence I think it's a bubble.

But you have no idea what the price should or could be at for current adoption. You act as if the speculation can or should go away, and as if it is not just as much of a real component of bitcoin's utility as whatever you think its adoption or fundamentals are now.

>I don't know why you would say that economists don't refer to things as bubbles anymore, they certainly do. 

That's not quite what I said. Reread it, and your linked definition of bubbles. When you understand that ""intrinsic value"" is not a thing (except as a technical term used in finance)...that value **cannot** be inherent by definition...then you'll start to see why throwing around ""bubble"" in bitcoin is meaningless.

>I don't know why you think commodities can't experience bubbles, they can. 

I didn't say they can't: I went by your definition which points out that in commodities, we can really only call something a bubble in retrospect, if at all. Stocks are different.  They have objective earnings to refer back to and liquid and capital assets.

>Being a bubble is not connected to P/E ratios or other historic ratios, although there is a connection. 

Again, not quite what I said.

Listen, is bitcoin's current price at or near a high which is probably going to come crashing down soon )or maybe a bit more crazy up, but then down)?  Sure! I think so too. That's not a revolutionary or even an uncommon thought here.  You can't just waltz in to bitcoin land with your obviously very limited outlook on it and preach to us old hands (been weathering the ups and downs since 2010) about the dangers of over-exhuberance or think that you're being the voice of reason or something.  We get it. We've seen this over and over and held and bought through it (and profited). 

 Again, if you have some information or insight as to why something will fundamentally change the historic trend and pricing cycles...I'm all ears! But otherwise, your voice-of-reason shtick is both old and not relevant.

If you indeed feel so surely about your position, I highly suggest that you short bitcoin...if you are correct, you both profit and actually did something efficacious to dampen the exhuberance of the market.

"I've enjoyed this back and forth. I was on the side of Markers until he claimed that you could use your old private key to get your new quantum safe one- as you pointed out this wouldn't work as others would also know your old private key. 

An alternative solution is to simply soft fork (would only require soft fork, if there was a previous hard fork to allow quantum keys) to a version when you cannot spend using legacy private keys at all. People would have to have sent their coins to a quantum safe address by then. Of course, this only works if this is rolled out a long time (at least a year) before quantum computers start to crack bitcoin.

"Backing with silver or gold is almost meaningless, other than an irrational comfort factor that it gives people who don't understand how currency works.

The value of a currency is based not on what the notes are physically made of, but on the wealth that it represents. When you use a physical commodity to back a currency, all it means is that the price of the commodity will inflate far beyond any intrinsic value it has, to match all the wealth it represents. That premium 
depends on the economy that's using the currency, and it can disappear just as easily, no matter what physical representation the currency has - gold, silver, paper, or digital data.

"> If you can imagine something else that is novel that is likely to happen and show why you think it will cause a massive break with bitcoin's price cycles (which include booms and busts, but rarely crashing below previous crashes' lows, and characterized by slowly decreasing volatility), then I'm all ears.

I'm not in the ""Bitcoin is a bubble"" camp, but my imagination is up to your challenge. All it would take is a new cryptocurrency with sufficiently significant advantages over Bitcoin to appear and become popular quickly. 

There are several scenarios in that case, but one of them is a rapid switch out of Bitcoin partly driven by fear of the impact on Bitcoin. In that case, a massive break with Bitcoin's price cycles would occur, Bitcoin would turn into one of the cheap altcoins, and would eventually be mainly of historical interest.

To be clear, it's probably more likely that such a switch would happen gradually, without a single unrecoverable crash, but the point is that obvious terminal crash scenarios do exist.

To your first concern about losing bitcoin. I don't think it will be a problem if bitcoin is adopted it will be valuable enough people will learn not to lose it. If it did become an issue bitcoin could be changed to be divisible by even more decimal points. So instead of every bitcoin being made up of 1 million satoshis we would create an even smaller unit. Each lost bitcoins value is just added to the remaining bitcoin as they become more scares. 
Trying to explain price movements is fools errand. Bitcoin is global and there is just way to much going on to know what is causing what. If I had to guess it's simply that bitcoin is still here.

"But dead addresses won't update... And long-term-cold-storage addresses might not update. Reread my second-to-last paragraph where I addressed the options here.

Not to mention that this is now a new address format unlike segwit, so everything that deals with Bitcoin, from wallets to exchanges to hardware to miners will need to handle both formats.

You can be condescending all you want (I've got a CS degree too buddy, I just ended up not majoring in cryptography and instead kind of gave up going for my masters and focused on my job), but if you really knew your crypto you would understand how big of a deal this is, especially because there aren't really any well tested QC proof asymmetric encryption algos yet. (Lattice based crypto is my personal bet, but there are significant tradeoffs with it, and a lot of the implementations are copyrighted and patented for a long time).

I'm not trying to be doom and gloom here, I'm just saying that if we ignore this it will bite us, badly. If QCs show up capable of using shors algorithm before we are 100% done the move to post-QC algorithms, Bitcoin as we know it will be fucked. Anyone with a QC will be able to spend anyone's coins at any time. They will be able to sign messages as anyone, they will be able to mine new coins significantly faster than even the best ASICs (although that is about the least bad effect from them, it would just be a continuation of the efficiency gains with current ASICs and really wouldn't change much).

We will need to rewrite Bitcoin as we know it for a post-QC world, and if we don't, the result will be that a post-QC-safe coin will most likely take over as people move their wealth to the new coin as the threat of a practical quantum computer becomes more and more real (not necessarily a bad thing on its own, but it does mean that Bitcoin dies)";5;1;False;Klathmon;dnl3u27;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

Nobody wants to spend Bitcoin because its price is ever increasing. It's essentially a currency that you don't want to spend because in a year that $100 in BTC you used to buy something could be worth $1000. Take the case of the guy being pizza for 100 bitcoins or whatever. So, nobody is spending it and therefore it doesn't have any intrinsic value as a currency. Eventually, people catch on and start exchanging for $$. But who will want to buy in for a currency that isn't a currency? The price vs. $$ collapses with potentially no/few buyers. That's how I've understood it and the calls for HODLing make it seem like that is the case.

It's a commodity/remittance system slowly transitioning to a currency. You can't spend it everywhere yet, but you can spend it. Whatever your currency is, you can't spend it in most places outside your home country either, but the fact that it is not universally accepted doesn't make your USD/ whatever not money. You can convert your currency to another currency and spend via visa etc worldwideq, but you can do that with Bitcoin too. The idea behind bitcoin is that the scarcity creates value, which is required to function as money.

"You can't smartly spend bitcoin anywhere though. Anytime you spend bitcoin you are missing on on the future growth. That's why viable currency for healthy markets is inflationary, not deflationary.

"There's no such thing as a price that it ""should"" be. 

The price depends on two main factors: (1) fundamentally, the size and underlying wealth of the market that's using it, i.e. the value of the goods and services being purchased with it; and (2) speculatively, the number of people who believe in the future of Bitcoin enough to buy and hold it for some period in an attempt to profit. 

Both of those factors change over time, and the value of a Bitcoin changes accordingly. The same goes for other currencies, too.

Lol you really called me a noob. It's an asset that will decline eventually after being over valued and a majority of the population won't get into it until it's at it peak. It's an investing bias that happens all the time. Sure if you bought bit coin in 2000s you're licking your chops now. I personally don't see the long term investment being worth it, and I'm not sure how decentralized current will work going forward. I was wrong to say banned, but increased regulations in addition to increased government regulation is still bad. I just think investing in mutual funds is a much better option. If you're going to truly make money off of bitcoin now you'd probably need a lot of capital, which at that point you should go into the actual market. If you're not rich why invest and get a small amount of bitcoin. There's simply too much risk involved with the product.

"> bitcoin as *the* currency might not.

It's almost certainly isn't going to be The Last Crytpocurrency, but I don't really know why that's important. Everything has a lifecycle.

I guess what many people are looking for is what they perceive as the stability of a major fiat currency. For example, the US dollar has been around for 225 years, which isn't really that long, but it's about three human lifetimes, which makes it seem stable and durable from a subjective individual perspective. (Interesting to note that Bitcoin has existed for nearly 5% of that time!)

There's a good chance Bitcoin itself won't last centuries, though, so for people who are looking for something they feel is safe and durable over a long period, Bitcoin is not it. There's some validity to that perspective - Bitcoin is currently potentially subject to replacement in a way that most fiat currencies aren't, and replacement will be financially painful for many people. A naive way of characterizing this is to say that Bitcoin is a bubble.

"**Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a worldwide cryptocurrency and digital payment system called the first decentralized digital currency, since the system works without a central repository or single administrator. It was invented by an unknown programmer, or a group of programmers, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. The system is peer-to-peer, and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.

"**White paper**

A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.

The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint.

"Yes but anyone that doesn't update their addresses in time will most likely have their coins stolen.

Not to mention the massive amounts of coins that were previously ""lost forever"" which are now up for grabs (think Satoshi's wallet). At the very best it going to be a monumentally difficult time for Bitcoin, at the worst it could be the final blow.

I love bitcoin, and I really want it to succeeded, but these things are a very real threat. We will need several years to design and implement a new signing algorithm, not to mention the amount of warning we will need to give people.

Every single address out there will need to be changed, every single one. Even segwit is child's play compared to a change like that. And to make things worse there is no ""defined date"" that quantum computers will become useful.

We have estimates (and even the more critical estimates believe they will happen at some point), but all it takes is one or 2 good breakthroughs and Bitcoin is caught with it's pants down.

I know you think that you can just think up an easy solution to this in 30 seconds, but the reality is that it's going to be a hell of a lot of work, and that work needs to start sooner rather than later. And in this climate where we can't even agree on small changes, what makes you think we will be able to handle moving away from ECDSA? That's WAY more critical to Bitcoin than even the PoW algorithm. ECDSA IS Bitcoin. And you can't just upgrade a private key to be a new algorithm but leave the public alone, that's not how this stuff works.

"I've been out of the cryptography currency scene for a little while. And I'm seeing that bitcoin just keeps getting more valuable, so it's tempting for me to try and get in on it. So I have a few questions if you wouldn't mind.

There is a limited amount of bitcoin IIRC, so long term, do you think bitcoin would be a valid currency due to the nature of it? Since bitcoin can be lost forever, whether it's a bad hard drive or a wrong address, what would happen when the amount starts to dwindle down?

And also, what would you contribute it's recent success to? Genuinely curious. I used to follow it a few years ago but I was a broke teen in highschool.

"Well, mining is a particularly clever solution to some interesting problems.  tl;dr:

1) You need to introduce new currency somehow as the market grows

2) There's no central bank that just makes this free money for themselves - that's the point - so how do you introduce it?

3) A large amount of users need to do a lot of expensive computation - and do it honestly.  That is, it needs to be more profitable to mine honestly than to attack the network.

Therefore, you pay legit miners with the new coins, solving the problems with each other.

As for ""bank"" websites, well, part of the reason for Bitcoin's existence is to no longer need a bank that controls your money.  You and only you are supposed to control your money.  Exchange websites are useful, but leaving your money in them is foolish and goes against the intended purpose.  Not to mention they were startups in a new tech space - what's the success rate on those? 2%? lol.  Sure enough, some of them imploded in various ways and took people's money with them, because they trusted random Internet startups with their money.  However, it's not the fault of the currency that some companies that worked with it were untrustworthy or poorly run.

As for what you can buy with Bitcoin, I just put $100 CAD into my Steam wallet again.  That's the main way I've been spending it.

Why would there be a slow decline in speculation?

Bitcoin has quadrupled from $1,000, but has transaction volume quadrupled? has the number of merchants accepting bitcoin quadrupled?

The growth of speculation far exceeds the growth of the currency use.

At the rate the speculation is growing, compared to the rate the actual currency use is growing, speculation will have hit unsustainable levels long before the value of the currency could rise to replace it.

While I don't think speculative demand is the same as store of value demand, I don't think the two are mutually exclusive either.

">It would rise and then eventually flatline

Why wouldn't all the people who only bought bitcoin as an investment at that point then sell all their bitcoin to invest that money in a new appreciating asset?

People who have large amounts of money invested in something aren't just going to sit on it when it stops producing returns. 

The ratio of market cap compared to overall transaction volume is extremely high which means a lot of people aren't using it as a functional currency but as an investment opportunity, much like gold.

That's not true of ""most"". Plenty of dotcoms delivered a product, but couldn't make a business out of it.

"I'm into Bitcoin and want it to succeed. Having said that, I couldn't agree more. I was trying to convey how hodl culture may damage Bitcoin, but I think you expressed it very well. Following up, I think there may be two possibilities for Bitcoin's adoption: 

(1) Commerce and stores don't want to miss out, so they start accepting it and it goes mainstream. That would solve one issue, because we'd have places to spend it. One may argue that there may be no incentives to accept Bitcoins for trades as there wouldn't be much demand. However, even if that's the case, it is virtually free to setup a wallet, so that doesn't seem to be a problem.

(2) Bitcoin is not seem as interesting to invest by corporations because of its user base, currently composed mainly of speculators and holders. I'm not sure this is fair, as I can't tell how large the share of holders and speculators really is, but that is the perception I get from visiting subs and /biz/. Another crypto with a better user base, better distribution system, or better something kicks in and steals Bitcoin place. 

I don't know if such possibilities are accurate--I don't even know if they are possibilities at all. I'm just trying to start a discussion. I think the best way for Bitcoin to succeed would be to use it. This would create more demand, several services and stores would be interested. Spreading the word and wanting more people to get in,

"Interesting. The current lack of a ""whole marketplace of goods and services using the Bitcoin infrastructure"" concerns me as well. I don't know if it can pass through this mostly speculator phase to a store of value phase and eventually on to a currency phase. I would add that gold probably had a similar price discovery in its beginning similar to what's currently happening with Bitcoin.  Imagine the first person trying to exchange his newly discovered pretty yellow rock for a goat? But now gold seems to be holding value pretty well despite a lack of use as a currency in buying goods and services.

"> There was a large speculative bubble in gold. It burst. It nearly halved in value between 2010 and 2013. And that's for a precious metal that has scientific and industrial uses and is a finite physical material.

Bitcoin halved in value 2 weeks ago, it does that all the time…

> Do you think your bitcoins can't halve in value?

Has happened about 25 times so far over the past 3 years, personally I don’t care.

> Gold will never be completely abandoned because it has certain irreplaceable properties as a fundamental element of the universe.

Gold has value because people buy it, it’s that simple.

Bitcoin has value because people like me buy it.

> you really shouldn't be gambling any money on bitcoin.

I don’t gamble, I am an idealist. I do it for political reasons. :P

I don’t care about the price.

> There are hundreds of millions of people depositing hundreds of billions of dollars into their bank account every month, that does not magically make dollars quadruple in value in a year.


When people deposit dollars into their bank account, they already have dollars. If people sell their dollars for Euro’s, the price of the Euro relative to the dollar will rise. So yes, currency does work that way.

Dollars and Euro’s are also a speculative investment that one day could disappear.

Currencies are like languages, there is plenty of space in the world for multiple currencies and they rarely ever go extinct. Litecoin and Bitcoin have both been standing strong for years and so have the Dollar and the Euro.

">You can’t spend EUR in USA, is it not an actual currency?

That’s different.

Let’s say two Europeans make a bitcoin transaction. A gives B 10 BTC (for like a car or something, doesn’t matter). Now B has 10 BTC, obviously, but where can he spend it? Well, he could find somebody else interested in BTC and purchase something from them with it. That seems simple enough. But what if he really needs to pay rent right now? What is the likelihood that his landlord accepts BTC? What if he needs groceries? What if he wants to buy a pizza? What if he wants to watch Netflix? It goes on and on and on.

If A had given B 35,000 Euros none of this would be an issue for B. He could have gotten everything he reasonably wanted for Euros, but he couldn’t with Bitcoin. That is what “widely accepted” means. It has to be accepted enough so that somebody can reasonably expect to live their lives using it, and only occasionally converting to other currencies during special circumstances.

As it is right now, Bitcoin is an asset people just hold onto in hopes that they can sell it for more of their chosen fiat currency, or a commodity people trade for goods and services, but *almost always* exchange it back to a fiat currency at best.";30;3;False;DistantFlapjack;dnl8jlg;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"I don't think bitcoin is a bubble because bubbles come about when the market starts paying more for something than it is worth. But because bitcoin is a currency of sorts (let's not argue semantics - it is used for buying, selling and saving) so it is inherently worth the price people are paying for it.

Furthermore, the wider the adoption is, and the higher the entry point, it gets further away from a total collapse and failure. Most ICOs suck because 50 people buy a hundred bucks worth hoping to strike the next bitcoin, but the coin offers little advantage over other major coins, aside from a very low entry price. A few months later, demand hasn't materialised and those 50 people eat a regrettable, but ultimately insignificant, $100 loss. 
For bitcoin to collapse like that we would need millions of people (many of whom bought in at $4000 or more) to collectively decide they're just going to let it go. Highly unlikely.

"**South Sea Company**

The South Sea Company (officially The Governor and Company of the merchants of Great Britain, trading to the South Seas and other parts of America, and for the encouragement of fishing) was a British joint-stock company founded in 1711, created as a public-private partnership to consolidate and reduce the cost of national debt. The company was also granted a monopoly to trade with South America, hence its name. At the time it was created, Britain was involved in the War of the Spanish Succession and Spain controlled South America. There was no realistic prospect that trade would take place and the company never realised any significant profit from its monopoly.

"When bitcoin mining started, you could win the bitcoin lottery and get 50 of them, just using your CPU.  They weren't worth much, of course.  Then came the GPU miners, and the CPU miners got left in the dust.  After that came the ASICs, which are more powerful than GPUs (and FPGAs) and are the main miners today.

Meanwhile, the rule built into bitcoin is that every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years) the reward gets cut in half.  This has happened twice so far, so the reward for finding a block is currently 12.5 BTC.  

In the CPU/GPU days, it became so hard to mine bitcoin that a solo miner might have to wait months to mine a block.  In that time, the difficulty would be expected to increase further, yielding the possibility that a solo miner wouldn't ever mine a block at all.  So mining pools were formed, where miners banded together to mine blocks, and split the proceeds based on how much hashpower they contributed.  By joining a mining pool, a miner converts a long-shot chance of mining a whole block into a steady stream of small payouts.";1;0;False;dmdeemer;dnla7tj;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

I'll pay attention to what the market itself has to say, rather than some prediction that a person whose name is irrelevant has. So far, the market has shown that, while the value of Bitcoin (and crypto-currencies in general) is volatile, it most certainly has a place in global economics.

To assume Bitcoin 'will literally fade out to zero value' based on some upcoming regulations is not an educated assumption, especially given the history of Bitcoin and attempts by various governments to regulate it across the world.

Even if these regulations do get put into place, people will still be able to use Bitcoin for transactions. It is not possible to prevent people from transacting in Bitcoin and as long as people are willing to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, it will have value.

"Bitcoin is a scam because it's a pyramid scheme and it can never be successful as a currency.

"To be fair just because it is at $100k, $500k or even $1 million doesn't mean it isn't a ""scam.""

I mean isn't one of the lessons learned here that a currency is basically always a pyramid scheme? Unless when you invent the currency you dole it out evenly, isn't it immediately lopsided in SOMEone's favor? 

Everyone brained would agree that this is 100% a ""if you get in early you reap massive rewards from doing so"" situation. 

Just because a pyramid scheme has a really good idea at it's core doesn't mean it is any less of a pyramid scheme. There is simply no other way to issue a currency: do you think that if they waited until 2020 to allow everyone interested to CPU mine or whatever, that people would be excited for it? That all the development and all of the same hype and speculation would happen? Of course not.

You just have to start it, and whoever's in on it early has an obvious advantage.


Pyramid scheme is appropriate, but I don't think it is a ""scam"" in the slightest. Everything flattens out, valuation wise, at some point where scarcity automatically increases inversely to, presumably, adoption rates. 

It is theoretically possible for the valuation of 1btc to increase to ""all the money in the world when all bitcoins are mined / 21,000,000"" if bitcoin was to basically replace every store of value.

So right now, you stand to gain a massive multiplier. But someone who ""Gets in"" the week before that happens will never see bitcoin increase in value at that same multiplier. 

In other words, there are people right now that have seen ~40,000x their investment. At some point in the future someone might be lucky to see 2x their investment.

Even if 100% of the people claiming it was a scam bought in today, they too could see another 40,000x growth. It is still the ""early adoption"" period.

To me, It's a scam no matter what.  You're printing your own money.   Mining bitcoin is no different than counterfeiting in my point of view.  We should absolutely move towards a decentralized digital currency like bitcoin, but I don't think you should be able to just get rich MINING bitcoin (if you bought it and the value went up and you got rich, then fair game.  I don't have a problem with trading currency) and have that be a legitimate form of income.  But, my opinion is coming from a pretty limited education on digital currency.  If someone could offer a rational counter argument and try and change my view on the matter, I welcome it.;0;4;False;Bottled_Cat_Farts;dnld51u;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"> Almost none of that increase in price comes from its usefulness as a currency.

Bitcoin enables me to be my own bank and escape the central banking system. Even though I rarely use Bitcoin to buy stuff (because that isn’t always an option), I use Bitcoin to buy fiat when I need something. So indirectly I use Bitcoin for everything I buy.

As long as people like me will keep depositing their salary into Bitcoin each month, the price will keep going up, especially considering there is a limited amount of coins.

You might say it’s foolish to use Bitcoin to be your own bank, but personally I think it’s foolish to trust bankers with your hard earned money.

"Friend of mine was mining bitcoin very early on. By the time it hit $30, he had mined a few thousand bitcoin.

His wife never cared, or understood what he was up to because, come to find out years later, she was cheating on him. In a classy move, she leaves him and takes pretty much everything. Bitcoin isn't mentioned once during the proceedings. She files sometime in fall of 2013 when btc was racing up to $200. It was a really nasty divorce. She tried to take everything from him. Thank God they didn't have kids, because she probably would have gotten them too and it would have broken his heart even more. Anyway, by the time the ink has dried on the divorce papers btc hits its high of $1200. He moves back to chile to be with his parents and uncle since he has nothing here. He sold about 100 btc when it hit $950 on its way back down from $1200.

He lives like a fucking Columbian drug lord and had most of that 95k invested in mining right when the Asics arms race really ramped up. He only pulled out enough btc for his family and his operation to live a comfortabke life on, amd reinvested the rest in mining. He's got well over 4k bitcoin at this point with mining operations I'm China and India. That cheating bitch didn't see a single satoshi because it was a completely invisible asset. He never talked about it with afk friends or family, and he travels the world, lives on the beach on a 40 acre property in the dream home he built, has a new wife, and just had a kid about 6 months ago.

"The way I see it, that I haven't seen explained yet here, is that block chain itself will revolutionize the internet and all computer/phone applications. The decentralization, smart contracts, security all add up to be the direction of the future. Bitcoin, and other cryptos, are just one aspect of a blockchain. A tokenization of a blockchain. To execute financial transactions on the future internet or any future application built on blockchain, you will need to use the token that goes along with the blockchain your internet or application is on. Bitcoin and ethereum and a few others will be those tokens (or maybe some crypto yet to be invented). There will be the ability to use multiple different crypto currencies within one blockchain, and this means there will be exchange rates and there will be different reasons to use different cryptos. Eth will be great for complex financial exchanges (stocks, loans, etc). Btc will be a store of value. You might need to move assets between different cryptos depending on the action you are taking.

In short, the world will be built on blockchain in the future because of the benefits inherent in blockchain. In order to participate in that world, you will need to hold crypto in some form or another because that will be the vehicle for financial transactions.

We aren't there yet because there has not been enough development and adoption of blockchain apps and internet. The growth and movement towards a blockchain world is what will build the value of cryptocurrencies and that value will stabilize for bitcoin and others, but there will always be new and up coming currencies, just like there are in today's world. The yuan  gains purchasing power, the euro gains purchasing power, it is just that our current currency world is highly matured and the most recent major currency launch was the euro. 

Based on my limited understanding at the moment (I am always learning new stuff that changes that opinion), a key indicator to watch to understand future crypto value and practicality are companies like blockstack and others that are building a blockchain based internet and providing a platform for app dev on that chain (I think they are using btc as the token for now).

"Bitcoin succeeding and disrupting traditional finance was what excited me about Bitcoin a few years ago, too. 

But I suspect 80% of the people into Bitcoin are in it to make money. (I'm not saying making money's a bad thing.) Whether or not that's good for Bitcoin's potential to improve society, that I'm not so sure.

"since this thread has become about whether BTC is valuable or not, I figure I'll put in my two cents

seems a lot of people in here are often repeating ""if ppl think it's worth X then it's worth X"" which is an overly simplistic view of just about anything imo. this is a complex topic but just would like to point out it isn't as simple as that.

BTC might always have some value going forward but there are many reasons people buying now should be careful at least (we'll use USD as an example)

1. USD is backed by a government and its military. For some this is why they prefer crypto but in the end we know that USD comes with the strength of the US military. Until governments and their militaries are willing to kill to protect the value of BTC it will never have the same gravitas as something like USD

2. USD and banking systems around it have built in dispute resolution and ways of correcting errors. Wires can be reversed if sent to the wrong account, money can be returned if stolen by fraud etc, whereas with BTC once the money is out of your wallet that's the end of it. Again, for some they consider this a strength of BTC but for practical uses in the real world many times dispute resolution is required and in fact produces the greatest good (even outside of finance exampled by the congested court system)

3. BTC will need to put up with new pressures from existing financial monoliths that are creating their own cryptos/equivalents that can be used to reconcile payments and apply the technology that makes BTC so interesting in the first place. I think this further marginalizes BTC/cryptos in the longterm

These are just my opinions on this and I hope this can open up a larger discussion concerning these points and why you agree/disagree";4;1;False;suckafucknigga;dnlfu8s;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"God. Even if it goes to $1 billion, it still is  mostly a scam. 

Speculation is not a viable means of using currency. The more that the Bitcoin speculation value increases, the more people will hoard it. If the value keeps on increasing, then people will use it only as a form of speculative wealth creation, and not as a crypto currency. This is already happening now thanks to 5k milestone.

not to hate, but i personally feel that every economic system currently available is a form of scam... in that they are designed to represent value, yet they typically have no internal mechanisms to protect said value. I mean currency is tied to production, distribution, as well as need.. yet all we have are weak consumer protections that are eroded every year.. the thing i think i like about bitcoin is that it represents the fact that people *can* change these large systems and that we *could* take back our economy... but truth is there is no reason to think that bitcoin isn't just like the dollar or euro. just another platform that will be used to exploit people in some place or another...sorry just the term scam got the wheels churning. maybe if it can be kept separate long enough to actually take over bit could actually be the force for change. maybe weird things will happen and this is only the begging and eventually it will be the only currency :) and ai will be in charge of inflation/loans. ;3;0;False;corelatedfish;dnkw5hf;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

"Mining costs almost the same as just buying most of the time. The only upside is that you're always averaging your cost.

Also, I don't get how you feel that Bitcoin is a scam because it's ""printing your own money"" but it's OK for governments to print all the money they want without limit? At least with Bitcoin you know what the limit is, you know what the inflationary rates are. With government issued currency they can literally change their minds at any time and start printing whatever they want until the currency is literally worthless, which makes saving money very difficult.

I don't think Bitcoin can be the only answer though, there's some good arguments to have inflationary currencies to promote spending, but certainly having Bitcoin as an option for hedging against excessive inflation is very useful so you don't end up a zimbabwean trillionaire.

Bitcoin being decentralized allows for this without government controlled banks (why do you think Chinese government shut down Chinese exchanges?)

"The value of bitcoin driven by speculation does not make it ""not a scam"" regardless of how high it gets, what makes it not a scam is only how fully it becomes integrated as an actual currency that people use to exchange goods and services (other than national fiat currencies)...

EDIT: To those saying a 'bubble' and a 'scam' are different, you are of course right. In some ways the distinction is important: a scam is driven by the deliberate actions of an individual; a bubble is theoretically just an emergent property of a free market . However a bubble can in practice be ridden like a wave by those clued into what the bubble is sensitive to. Since most people buying into bitcoin can't read the minds of bankers and high government officials with regulatory power, we are basically gambling, whereas some players are *playing* actively and strategically. So far, bitcoin has been a good long-term investment, but almost certainly this will cease to be the case, eventually. I'm not saying that has happened yet, just that it will and some people are closer to knowing when than others...

"As someone from the outside looking in, who toyed with the idea of investing in it, but ultimately decided not to; these are the things that keep me skeptical of it:

* It's not very liquid. I can't spend bitcoin at the supermarket, corner store, Amazon, etc. As it stands, it is just a commodity being traded (and a strange one at that). Some people accept bitcoins, but only because they plan to turn it into real money.
* If it did gain hold enough that people began to use it over other currencies, what is to stop governments from blocking its usage with laws? Saddam Hussein wanted to stop trading oil in US dollars, and now he is dead for it. 
* Why is the value going up? Because more people are buying it obviously. What justifies the current price? Nothing. Nothing but the fact that there are people willing to spend that much for it. So what happens when people decide to cash out? You could argue that a lot of markets are like this, but this is the only market that does not trade a tangible good. It's basically a pyramid scheme where you require more and more people to buy in so you can profit (and by profit, I mean turning it into real money). 

Its these reasons that make me hesitant to buy a bitcoin. At the price it is at it is way way way too risky for me. 

Don't get me wrong. I am super happy for anyone who bought these early on for pennies and are rich from it now. That's awesome! But, I feel bad for the people who will buy it at the cusp, and then lose a LOT of money when the pyramid crumbles.

"> I mean isn't one of the lessons learned here that a currency is basically always a pyramid scheme? Unless when you invent the currency you dole it out evenly, isn't it immediately lopsided in SOMEone's favor?

I'm no expert, but I think you're confusing currency with the economy that uses the currency.  The Bitcoin community, and the value of the coins, includes both: the currency, how it's created, the economy built around it, etc.

For example, bitcoin (probably) could have been set up so that everyone on a network gets an even share of newly generated coins, so that generating coins was a public good and not just a greedy act, and that everyone would share in the ""wealth"" equally.  Instead, it follows quite a different model, where the people in first become super-rich, and the people who hear about it or get involved later become ""the poor"", so to speak.";7;3;False;;dnlihx6;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

That's not true.  A government can force commerce to be done in a new currency, and then make that currency available to be purchased at a fixed exchange rate.  When people trade in their other currencies, the government prints out new currency and adds the other currency to their forex reserves.
