Do you think the Internet is tangible?

I'm sure this would lead to PoW change.

> Miners rule bitcoin

They don't. This was demonstrated several times and it's also logical implication of how verification software works. If we change the software to stop accepting blocks with old PoW and start using a new PoW, then miners can't stay mining old PoW because otherwise they would have nobody to sell the coins they mined. If they really are greedy, they will have to change the PoW too.

I’m not delusional enough to expect such a small initial investment to eradicate everything - although it would have if I’d bought in at the beginning. Can you imagine having invested $2000 when coins were worth $2? You’d have eight figures now. I don’t ever expect returns like that, but I foresee a moment in the future when the value of my bitcoin holdings will equal my car loan or my mortgage, or the cost of the RV I’ve been wanting to buy, and at that point I’ll cash it out. ;2;0;False;NotRoryWilliams;dr1m66p;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

What makes you think it doesn't have utility. In my opinion Bitcoin is a response to the central banking system which seems to believe in Keynesian economics. People who save money must constantly invest it or they will loose the value. This means that the dollar is a terrible store of value. Bitcoin in theory is a much greater store of value because it cannot be printed out of thin air. It must be mined and its programmed to have a finite amount. This means it's price should stabilize once it is adopted. All of this is speculative but from I can tell I don't really see too many holes in the theory for why it could work as a store of value. I see crypto currency as the only legitimate response to central banking in the last century.

"The concept of “selling” money is a bit weird - what you often say is you’re “exchanging” money, whether that’s forex (foreign exchange) or for goods and services.

If the very concept of “selling” bitcoin is still a thing in 20 years, that means it’s not become liquid enough to be seen as an exchange for goods and services, and is still being used as some sort of store of wealth for investment purposes. 

I guess there’s nothing down right wrong about that, other than the fact the objective was to become money - in which case it will have failed.";17;3;False;Plyphon;dr16lr4;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg
"By ""selling bitcoin"", I assume he means holding onto it until 2040 to wait to sell it.

There's a reason why every central bank wants to have a healthy rate of inflation where $1000 in a year buys you less things than if you were to buy now. If a currency devalues the longer you hold onto it in cash, it motivates people to spend it on things (which is productive) and invest their money into productive things (stocks, savings accounts). If a currency does more the longer you hold onto it in cash, it motivates people to hold onto it (like gold, bitcoin).

So obviously if your currency doesn't motivate people to do productive things with it, it has failed to be an effective currency, more of a speculative (no underlying asset / i.e. unpredictable) asset.

"**Cryopreservation**

Cryo-preservation or cryo-conservation is a process where organelles, cells, tissues, extracellular matrix, organs or any other biological constructs susceptible to damage caused by unregulated chemical kinetics are preserved by cooling to very low temperatures (typically −80 °C using solid carbon dioxide or −196 °C using liquid nitrogen). At low enough temperatures, any enzymatic or chemical activity which might cause damage to the biological material in question is effectively stopped. Cryopreservation methods seek to reach low temperatures without causing additional damage caused by the formation of ice crystals during freezing. Traditional cryopreservation has relied on coating the material to be frozen with a class of molecules termed cryoprotectants.

This sounds like someone who *doesn't* actually have a low-level understanding of the technology trying to criticize the technology on a low level.

But the knowledge that finances is important may not be, or having the opportunity to gain the life framework to recognize it might not be!

Like I said earlier, it's a fair outlook and I really do respect it, but I really do think at the exact same time that people like us aren't really going to understand how difficult it is to climb the ladder when there are a thousand fake and shitty ladders and all the rungs look the same. I've never been in poverty and I've been well-educated my entirely life. I've been sucking that silver spoon haaaaard.

It's why I'm not making any claims on what I think the real difficulty actually is, only trying to maybe convince you to ease on the certainty aspect a bit.  You think it's mostly choice. I think it mostly isn't. Who knows what the truth really is.

Basically, it can feel really unfair and shitty to the people who think they're supposed to be able to easily pick themselves up and out of ignorance and poverty when in reality they had no real chance to know what they were supposed to do, only what actually works in the short-term without a reliance on the long-term.";6;1;False;twewy;dr15k6q;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

"moments of volatility != uninterrupted constant volatility throughout the years of bitcoin's existence

A currency's utility comes in its lack of volatility (or rather, unpredictable volatility diverging from expected inflation/deflation that can be accounted for).

Bitcoin is an artificial derivative with extremely high beta, and the world's markets have no need for an alternative to the dollar as the primary global reserve currency. It would take a massive decoupling of the American economy from the global markets to change that fact, and that is extremely unlikely given how intertwined we are with all global markets. Whatever global currency may arise in the future will be a descendant of the US dollar, not a direct competitor like bitcoin.";5;0;False;;dr1c7ur;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

Very true, at the moment the dollar is in some ways superior to Bitcoin. But you can’t expect Bitcoin to be on the same level as the dollar in less than a decade, it will take time.

That being said, the USD is clearly a very important currency and any other currency will always have a hard time to compete, but that's just because it's one of the top examples. I wouldn't consider a tiny, barely known country's currency less of a currency than the USD, just like I wouldn't consider BTC in it's current state less of a currency than either of those.

> blockchain is an awesome tech

“blockchain” is a very inefficient way to create a database. Bitcoin uses it because it wouldn’t be able to survive without it. It would have been banned or shut down like every other e-coin that went before Bitcoin. There is nothing fancy about a “blockchain”, if you are going to do something where you won’t have to worry about a government banning your project you don’t need a blockchain. An ordinary webserver will be much more efficient. In fact, in most cases, even if you are going to do something ""debatable"" you don’t need a blockchain either. Silkroad never used a “blockchain” for example, neither does TOR or Bittorrent.

"Kind of, but also kind of not. 

You don’t “exchange” a good or service, you sell it. You wouldn’t walk into a shop and ask “‘how much are you exchanging that pint of milk for?” - it doesn’t make sense.

"Its not pointless. 

Investing in Bitcoin is gambling. Some people are under the impression that it can only go up, which really isn't true (at least in the long term). Maybe it's gambling with great odds, but without a time machine that's just opinion. 

It's important to emphasise that Bitcoin is very volatile and may either burst or dwindle into nothing because some people have invested way more money than they can afford to lose, or will invest more than they can afford to lose if someone tells them how amazing it will be without the disclaimer of ""it might just be a bubble"". 

Some people invest in the stock market. Assuming you've got a very diverse portfolio, you're unlikely to lose 10% of your money over a couple of years and very unlikely to lose 30%. Long term stock market crashes bigger than a third are rare, especially since after most crashes most companies mostly recover after a while. If it's more than that then the world has bigger problems. Therefore a sensible idea is to only invest in the stock market if you would be fine only keeping 70% of that capital, whether for retirement or whatever. If you can only save 5k/year and have a 5k expense in one year's time, investing in stocks is relatively risky. 

But with Bitcoin, because we know so little about it, it's hard to say what the risks are. Is the ""reasonable risk"" -10% over a couple of years? -50%? If it's completely crashes it might be -95%. We just don't know. So you should only invest what you can afford to lose ALL of. 

Do not encourage people to gamble more than they can afford to lose.";2;1;False;TacoinaToaster;dr1ljfy;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg
its not backed by nothing. Its backed by the  consistency of the relationship between the company and the public.

no. it's just simple. if a currency is inflationary then the check I get Monday will be worth less Saturday so I should spend it. but to have the opposite, that my check Monday will be worth (potentially substantially) more on Friday is not sound currency or the basis of a functional economy.  not to say that deflation is always a bad thing but something as deflationary as bitcoin will never be a real currency, it's an investment or a get rich quick scheme. ;2;1;False;GemstarRazor;dr1ad0k;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

"There is no difference between selling and exchanging. You are trading one thing for another thing and the two values are relative to each other. We say we are ""selling"" something when we trade it for money and we say we are ""exchanging"" something when we use goods, commodities or trade stocks/currencies. If I ""sell"" my Bitcoin for USD I am exchanging it for fiat currency because, for whatever my reasons are, I would rather hold the USD. If I'm buying a loaf of bread with my USD I'm exchanging the fiat for bread because, again - whatever my reasons are, I would rather hold the loaf of bread. So why bother using money? So we don't have to carry loads of shit everywhere we go to make exchanges with people. Your ideas of ""sell"" and ""exchange"" are formed by the system you are accustomed to which is likely a first world nation with a stable and generally safe monetary system.

"So I have a question. I don't have too much money in bitcoin, but it's all I feel I can put in without an expectation of getting it back soon.

But what, long term, is the reason to think Bitcoin will always dominate all the alt coins? Sure, the really high transaction fees and times may go down in time, but what sets bitcoin apart from all the new coins? Is it just that it was first and so will always win by default?

Everyone on this sub is holding but the smart traders already sold and will buy again on the dip it'll drop  5-10k in the next month. This currency isn't even a currency anymore it costs way to much in transactions to be considered a currency. So you have to treat it like a stock. The media is now hyping it up which means a pump and dump is happening.

Comparing bitcoin to the dollar is baseless. There’s no central currency in bitcoin, there could be five crypto currencies in the future, it’s not convenient enough to make it a currency like the dollar. Speculation is the only thing driving it right now, like tulips, or beanie babies as so many comments have stated. There is no value held against it, and the banking associated with it is already under investigation. Finally, it’s the fact that there are a few people essentially controlling the market would make me extremely wary. There is already conspiracy within the holders of the majority of bitcoin to fix the prices.

"Bitcoin market is super volatile right now. At $5,000 the marketcap (considering 21 million bitcoin limit) is $105B which is a drop in all of the currency and value in the world, a mere billion dollars moving makes it go up or down 1%. Seeing from this point of view, if bitcoin ever reaches 1 to 10% of the currency market - or 100% even, who knows? - being an international currency it's not competing only for national currencies space, it can get to $1 million per bitcoin and it's only $21 trillion which is near USA GDP (1 country).
Now, the talk is ""why is this worth X?"". Well, why is your paper dollar worth anything at all? It's just paper, $1 costs a lot less top print than $1 of bitcoin to mine. Confidence = value.
Also, the canadian dollar is directed by people vs bitcoin which is a mathematical formula and cannot be corrupted nor inflated at will, so it's price is preditable in the long term.
Now, I'm not saying bitcoin is the be all end all of crypto, but they sure got 1st to market and massive adoption rolling for them. ";4;1;False;deviousness;dr1gc2b;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg
the key definition of a market bubble is that prices rise materially above the fundamental value of the asset. Since there is no such a thing as a fundamental value for Bitcoin, the discussion is pointless.;3;1;False;TheMeatnTaters;dr22en8;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg
"You're somewhat correct.

A crypto-currencies value *should* be tied to the cost of mining a coin. As the difficulty of a coin increases, so do the cost and the value. In this way, the value is predictable. The reason that people mine the coin is because there is a demand to use the coin to trade for goods and services. As the demand increases, so does the value.

What we're seeing with Bitcoin is market speculation, like you discussed. People are stockpiling it in hopes that it will increase in value. In some cases, this is true. As long as there is a use for Bitcoin, more and more people will mine it, and the difficulty, cost and value will always increase slowly over time.

What we're going through right now is a scenario where people stopped actually using the currency because they think of it as an investment. Hoarding causes scarcity, which increases price. However, at some point, the price becomes too risky, and the speculators being a selloff, which we're obviously starting to see now. 

3 months ago, Bitcoins price was fairly stable. 3,000 to 4,000 is a fair price for a coin, given the current cost involved to mine one. After the massive value adjustments of the past month, people will start to realize that Bitcoin is far too volatile if it's used for speculation instead of actually currency. I think we'll continue to see it tumble until it's closer to what it's actual value is (maybe 6k). After that, you won't see as many people running to invest in it and it will continue its slow climb at a reasonable pace. 

OPs flow-chart is kinda correct, in that it will take 10-20 years for Bitcoin to get back to the 17k peak that we just saw. If you didn't sell at the peak, you're going to have to hodl for a while before it's worth that much again.";8;6;False;JeffCraig;dr177m4;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

The mere fact that it is a decentralized network is value enough(people can't track what you do with your money) Also there's the fact that there is a finite amount of Bitcoin and there is not a central bank to print more of it with no oversight.

I would sell today and walk away with enough to take a nice vacation, or just the increase in financial security from having a two-month emergency fund instead of a one-month emergency fund. But I don’t think I’m going to do that. I only invested what I was willing to lose (having savings at all was an aberration from my lifetime of just having what I need) and I’m willing to take the risk to see where it can go. 

I’m more aware than I was at the start of some of Bitcoin’s weaknesses. I’m concerned about transaction fees, transaction speed, and government regulations reducing the utility and the value adjusting as a result. But I don’t really think bitcoin’s future is as a tool of daily small-scale transactions. I think it’s future is as a store of value for large amounts, and as such I don’t think it’s hit it’s peak yet. Personally I think it will one day get to $100k, and when it does my meager investment will have grown from a month’s living expenses to a year’s living expenses, assuming I don’t invest any more, and I might not. So I’m holding. ";3;1;False;NotRoryWilliams;dr1fgmh;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

I'm not sure why it's so difficult to understand. It's going to take time for Bitcoin to be accepted and fully integrated into society. It's happening. But it takes time. In that time the value will for sure go up due to how many more people will be using it. Therefore we can make the connection that time is a variable of the value function. The more time that passes(at least right now) the higher the value should be.

"Bitcoin has to be a bubble. It creates nothing, isn't used for purchasing and only has the value subscribes to it. Any thing with a price upwards of ten thousand dollars that does not produce anything of actual value has to be a bubble and it will crash. This remaining stable makes no macro economic sense. I would like to present the south sea Company. This comapany made not a single cent in it's entire time being a company, but it's stocks skyrocketed because people saw a few ticks upwards to begin with (and being an English trading company helped) . Because stocks rose, people bought stocks, because they bought in, the stocks rose. That's exactly what's happening here, and as soon as the amount of people willing to buy into bitcoin dries up the prices will crash down to earth once panic selling begins.

This is because the block confirmation time of litecoin’s Blockchain is different than bitcoins. Bitcoins blocks are designed to be mined once every 10 minutes. Litecoin’s blocks are mined about once a minute (IIRC). This means that the time for your transaction to reach a certain depth is much less.

So you *can* have the same private keys stored in multiple places, and even across multiple wallets. (I wouldn't do that personally, but you can if you want.)

Without giving them props, then yes. That would be cultural appropriation. And I can see how from my comment it comes across that way, but he does credit these artists like Biggie and Prodigy in multiple ways, throughout interviews and even in printed versions of he plays I think. He also heavily supports the culture, such as having protests against trump, he has a Hamilton Mixtape with NUMEROUS black artists, and by having a majority of the people in his own play black. If you both respect and support the culture that you are benefitting from, it’s not appropriation. It’s simply cultural exchange. And Lin has proven that he does both many times. ;1;1;False;jman1255;dr0woup;How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!;7imq35;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/

when i read the OP message I too thought of Apple shares.

I lacked the foresight to see that AAPL would own a huge chunk of the smart phone space and that the public would go bananas for those sleek phones and wait in long lines and that AAPL would become a status symbol and luxury good par excellence ,,, how is it possible that I grew up near AAPL, went to one of the premier high schools in Silicon Valley (Bellarmine) etc etc etc have AAPL products all over the house and have been a prolific speculator in tech stocks ,,, and yet never made a dime on AAPL? and have been exposed to Apple-Mania and the hagiographic regard for demiGod Steve Jobs? i don't have a good answer to this question;2;0;False;whatgatsby79;dr1x8p7;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"Very sorry for your loss. I have a brother who I worried about on a similar level. For the past 20+ years he has had these obsessive thoughts of getting rich by these ridiculous ideas of inventions and internet schemes that all fall flat on their face. Each successive incarnation is more ludicrous than the last and he never learns since he just keeps doing the same thing over and over.

He has no education beyond HS and refuses to get one. This explains why he has been a security guard ever since. He is just stubborn and likely has a personality disorder. He's lost a fiancee over his obsessions and is a financial basketcase and, like your brother, has been increasingly withdrawn from friends and family. About 15 years ago, I found a chat window that was open and he was talking with someone about how he didn't see himself being around if he didn't have his own business whrn he reached 30.";1;0;False;MeIAm319;dr1czyo;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"[Because this.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchelltuchman/2015/11/14/volatility-is-a-good-thing-seriously/#52f448c4304a) 

[Probably better explained here.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010915/volatility-good-thing-or-bad-thing-investors-point-view-and-why.asp) 

> Volatility can benefit investors of any stripe. Many more conservative traders favor a long-term strategy called buy-and-hold, wherein stock is purchased and then held for an extended period, often many years, to reap the rewards of the company's incremental growth. This strategy is based on the assumption that while there may be fluctuation in the market, it generally produces returns in the long-run. While a highly volatile stock may be a more anxiety-producing choice for this kind of strategy, a small amount of volatility can actually mean greater profits. As the price fluctuates, it provides opportunity for investors to buy stock in a solid company when price is very low, and then wait for cumulative growth down the road.


Sure it's for equities, but the idea is the same. Even if you're buying and holding, you're probably not going to do all your buying at once - as more funds become available, you may put more in.

"I told my friends that they might want to buy a few bitcoins when the price was under $5 and nobody did. Now they act like I never told them. I spoke about bitcoin with my doctor a couple of years ago and he was quite interested. He brought the topic up a few days ago and told me that he never bought any after all. It's their loss.

I don't recommend bitcoin anymore now. Too many weak hands joined purely out of greed in the past 6 months and I just don't trust them. Many of them are too quick to panic and overreact. I think that they make bitcoin much more dangerous than it was when most users were passionate about it and knowledgeable.

If your friends don't buy and bitcoin keeps succeeding, they resent you for making easy money, forgetting that it took some courage to risk money when bitcoin was much smaller and to hold through dozens of dips and some major crashes. If they buy some and it crashes, they resent you because they consider that you're responsible for their loss.

"I used trade stocks mostly on news and fundamentals many years ago. Did ok but nothing to brag about.

Got into TA a few years ago and started developing my own system and to make a long story short; I made more the year after that than the entire years I used to trade on news and fundamentals. For me TA is what makes me money. 

So I personally wouldn’t dismiss TA for trading stocks. However, I don’t know how well it suits crypto and the extreme volatility but it wouldn’t surprise me if you have solid system and if you’re really good at TA you can make bank on crypto.

"Agree with this. I’ve spent the last week learning some real basic TA after being a skeptic.  It’s definitely useful if only to give you insight into all of the factors that you should take into account when deciding to trade (eg buy vs sell, volume, price levels). You combine those signals and indicators with whatever other fundamentals and market movement you’ve analyzed and you’re decisions will be a lot more well thought out, especially with short term timing. It’s about trying to create an educated guess and most of the TA literature is consistent in admitting that. 

We can’t dismiss it entirely anyway when the fact is that swing and day traders make a living off using this. It’s hard and takes experience and risk but it is well thought out. For instance, with a 3:1 reward/risk ratio you only need to be right 40% of the time to profit!";6;2;False;Tite_Reddit_Name;dr1snm4;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/

"It depends on what you mean by ""reliable."" If you're talking about reliability in terms of its ability to predict the market, I don't know of any good sources(and if I did why would I tell you? it would damage my ability to make money if I used it). If you're talking about ""reliable"" in the sense that its accurate, doesn't overhype, isn't biased, etc. then I think the best sources are developers (both of the original crypto and other cryptos, keeping in mind any conflicts of interest) and technical blogs. 

I read up on crypto by reading white papers, developers' blogs, and technical stats (like size of network, how quickly are coins being created, etc.). I also keep track of big news, especially things that are ""planned"" around a certain date, such as a big release or some big organization getting involved. This is important because this is all first-hand information. If you rely on other people to summarize information for you, you're not getting the complete picture. In my opinion it's pretty irresponsible to hold any crypto long term (i.e. invest rather than trade - this isn't super relevant for trading because you're looking at the short term volatility instead of the long term value) if you don't understand how it works.

I don't day trade crypto, although I've thought about it, I just don't think I would make enough money from it to be worth my while. In general I'd say if you want to learn to trade crypto, learn about trading in general. If you just learn from crypto day-traders you're going to get a lot of survivorship biased bullshit from amateurs/noobs who think they're geniuses because they made money in a hugely strong bull market. Real trading is technical and hard, don't believe it's easy and mostly guesswork just because that's a more convenient ""truth"". Best places to read are probably blogs by traders, textbooks on things like stats/stochastic differentiability/linear algebra/etc. 

If you're not willing to learn the hard math you shouldn't be trading, because you'll be eaten alive by the people who do know that stuff *when the time comes*. As soon as there's a bear market, all these amateur traders who think they can get by without technical analysis will lose all their money if they try to keep trading.";2;1;False;casa_vostra;dr24rgl;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/
That mattered more when people bought whole coins. That 0.0385 coins is a pretty good day's wage I have to wonder. When someone deposits $10k for a healthy gamble then they're looking at 0.624 coins vs 0.6 vs 0.7 coins. For a $10k deposit, 700 mBtc happens at $14,285.71. So while the USD to invest can happen at whole numbers, as BTC becomes the standard of wealth the whole numbers will matter more in BTC, mBTC, and bits.

> TA is merely plotting human emotion.

No, the price graph is plotting human emotion. TA takes the price graph and treats it as if it somehow contained everything that went into it, the whole boiling mess of human emotions that produced that price, without any loss. But the price graph doesn't retain all of that, it's a very lossy process. TA doesn't try to model the underlying chaos to predict human emotional reaction to future events. It merely looks at the graph and tries to find patterns. Good effort, but I don't think it's possible. There's seldom patterns to events, and when there is, I don't think it's something that can be gleaned from just a price.";1;0;False;jungle;dr24hnb;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/

"I have been studying technical analysis for 8 years now and honestly you learn something new every day. Markets change constantly but lately my predictions of where price is going is at a much higher rate than when I first started. 

Pivot levels, market structure, and swing points can drastically change your view on the market. In no way is technical analysis easy to learn. It’s all about how you apply the tools. It’s not as simple as signal lines crossing overbought oversold. So there is definitely a misconception of TA not working in bitcoin.  They are just not applying it correctly.

"The first thing I figured out 10 years ago when i spent a year day trading...  all the graphs explaining it look great once it has played out.  However if you cover up half of that graph and look at the view when you should have bought, or when you should have sold.
 It looks a lot different then when the pattern has finished playing out and you find a plethora of cases where that real time view is virtually identical to many other places that didn't end up finishing the pattern.

Quite simply... when you enter into technical analysis pay bery very close attention to the point that many ignore:  

the invalidation exit signals.

11. **Maximalism doesn't help you** 
Putting everything on a single crypto and becoming a cheerleader is really easy to do. It's a part of human nature to flock to the ""One True"" religion/team/country/crypto. You'll hear in your corner of the internet people calling that what you invested in absolutely problem-free and that other cryptos are the devil. But when you look at your investing history, it's more than likely diversification would have probably netted you more gains. If you find yourself in a situation where you're in an echo chamber - ask yourself, are you in it for the religion of a single crypto, or are you in for gains? Do research and don't be afraid of reading criticisms of your favorite crypto and positives of other crypto. They are immensely helpful in gauging future growth. Investing into something with a healthy amount of skepticism is not a crime. And you can bet that the biggest whales diversify because they understand that gains are to be had everywhere.

"Great post.
As somebody who lost all btc in mtgox hack in 2014 I would add two points about risk management:

11. Never ever keep your founds on exchange, always move it to cold storage ASAP after transaction. Keeping money on exchange is adding sense of security when price swings aka ""I will sell fast when shit hits the fan"" but it is not worth a risk. 

12. Always diversify your portfolio.

"Great post. Thanks for the write up. 

I was surprised when I saw crypto people analyzing graphs like they do with stocks. To those of us who run in the financial independence circles, it's well known that those so-called experts, or wanna-be psychics don't know what the hell they are talking about. Ever. They will tell you every time they guess correctly, but you will never hear their failures, or see their ratios of how often they guess correctly. Day traders all fail more than they win. All of them. Without exception. Except when they are lying to you. 

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT INDICATE FUTURE RESULTS!!! 

I take comfort in the FACT that no one, no one on this planet or any other, knows what will happen. Just buy and hold, and watch all the 'experts' make claims, and all the spineless Johnny-come-lately's panic and lose all their money. 

Edit: throw in some anecdotal evidence. I've been holding Tesla stock for years. I've read over and over from the 'experts' that every new electric car in development will be the Tesla killer. Solar power isn't efficient and will never be cheaper than coal, nuclear, etc. Production delays, a cryptic tweet, a strong breeze and Tesla is dead! Sell now! Panic! All bullshit.

"Someone with actual experience as a trader in commodities and forex here. There are good points in your post but I don't think all of it is accurate:

First, bulls and bears do matter. During a bull market everybody thinks they're a good trader because it's so easy to make money. If you're a good trader, you should be making money even during bear markets. Be wary of advice in general coming from traders who have made a lot of money in crypto recently: there is always an element of survivorship bias here, and also, **a monkey capable of throwing darts at the highest volume cryptos would have have been successful during the recent bull market**.

Your opinion on technical analysis is incredibly naive and tells me more that you don't understand it / don't want to try to understand it. **Trading is *not* about predicting massive events like a crash or huge upswing, trading is about making money *without* losing money when these events do occur.** In fact this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to ""trade"". I like to think of trading as one of two things: either providing liquidity to a market (for which the market ""pays you), or as a way of exacting a ""volatility tax"" on the market. You should never be left ""holding the bag"", so to speak, because your trading strategy should guarantee (or guarantee with some high probability) that this won't affect you negatively much, if at all. 

**Technical analysis (specifically, quantitative) is what drives non-amateur trading** and I can't believe you think guys on Wall Street don't do this. Of course they do this: the biggest money makers on Wall Street (Renaissance Tech, DE Shaw, Jane Street, Two Sigma) and ""Market"" Street (like the most successful prop trading firms on the CME) are all *quantitative* (which basically means they use technical analysis that works) Here is a good place to start if you or anyone else wants to learn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itô_calculus

Edit: Not every form of technical analysis works. If you don't have a strong math/programming background (as in, a Bachelors degree understanding of CS/Math/Physics at the bare minimum), technical analysis isn't for you. But if you use quantitative strategies like the biggest quant funds and prop traders use (or can understand them) then you would be fine.

The point on news is incredibly important though, especially with crypto. Here's the thing: it's really hard to pump and dump commodities and currencies IRL, especially in modern times now that information travels instantly and we have set up the system so that this is impossible. But everyone and their mom is trying to pump and dump every crypto they have a stake in, and journalism on cryptos is usually entirely devoid of anything remotely technical / informative other than ""wow this crypto exists and people are using it"". Bitcoin is a weird currency-asset thing in a class of its own, and is valued pretty much independently of any other market (at least causatively, except perhaps the price of electricity?), so it's really hard to come up with estimates of its ""true"" worth, whereas with oil or the GBP we can come up with confidence intervals, upper and lower bounds, etc.; this puts the market in a weird position where **market sentiment is probably the most reliable predictor of movement, but the ""signal"" of true market sentiment is crowded out by the ""noise"" of the market sentiment generated adversarially by people with vested interests** (I wonder how many people have actually tried to use game theory to account for this). So finding this signal is of the utmost importance, and understanding the content is absolutely key in finding this signal.

Finally, I don't really understand what you mean by advocating against day trading. Are you advocating holding cryptos over the course of several days? That's not really trading, that's more in the realm of ""short term investment"" or more broadly ""speculation"". **When trading, the more volatility of something, the less time you want to hold it (and also the less time it takes to make money off it via trading anyway).**  I view trading as exploiting volatility between market events - if you hold on to something for long enough for market events to occur, you're trying to make money off of those events *and* the volatility. In general predicting events is a lot harder than volatility - it definitely can be done, and you can make money off of it, but it requires a completely different set of skills than trading does.

TL;DR:

1. Bulls and bears matter. Don't quite your day job for trading solely because you did well during a bull market. 

2. ~~Technical analysis matters.~~ Technical analysis matters, if it works, which it may not. Specifically quantitative analysis is what you should be looking at. Don't just plug some shit into an excel spreadsheet, do some basic stats, and expect it to tell you anything important. 

3. The single most important thing in trading bitcoin is separating the small amount of good information from the mounds of shit out there.

4. Holding for multiple days, in my opinion, isn't really trading. Trading is about making money off of volatility in the market in the short term *without* exposing yourself to the longer-term volatility you get from holding.

Edits: Grammar, add TL;DR, bold

Edit: Poop, due to my background I assumed when people were talking about technical analysis they meant something more along the lines of quantitative strategies. Don't just throw numbers and functions at data and expect it to work. By technical analysis what I really mean is quantitative analysis, in case you want to read more about what actually works.";182;14;False;casa_vostra;dr1wfd5;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/

"Daytrading just isn't profitable anymore since the bots and their algorithms destroy humans. Daytrading was profitable in the 90s and early 2000s because there was nothing trading ups and downs of stocks besides humans which was necessary for financial markets including when people would want to sell a large amount of stock.

Lmao I never said anything about replacing central banks. It's an alternative for currency, stocks and commodities. Right now it works best as a store of value and it works as a currency, but not good enough yet. The real value of bitcoin as a currency lies in the future when lightning network makes it possible to send nearly instant transactions with almost no fees. If that gets implemented it will fix most of the problems you listed and it will most likely be ready in 2018. There are a lot of cryptocurrency that are better and more innovative than bitcoin, but bitcoin is probably going to be the first one to get adopted by the masses.

"> ""I don't care about the advantages of cryptocurrency, because I'm okay with banks, governments, using using FIAT as currency and stocks/commodities as a store of value"". 

Literally not a single one of my arguments amounts to that. This is very lazy straw manning, up there with ""they hate us for our freedom"". 

I'd rather have a decentralized currency that worked better and cheaper than fiat currency. That's not what you're offering. You're offering a speculative asset that can't practically be used as currency for 99% of things I currently use currency for.

I'm not interested in a currency I can't use as currency, I'm not interested in an asset that is primarily just something people try to profit on by speculating on its price, especially when people don't admit that's what they're doing.

> I think Bitcoin isn't that good as a currency, but it's a really good alternative for gold

Banks don't run on gold they run on fiat. How do you think bitcoin is going to replace central banking by being like gold? 

>I dislike FIAT because I need a creditcard or PayPal to buy anything abroad. 

It's a lot easier to get a credit card than it is to find somewhere that accepts bitcoin. Anyway I thought you said it wasn't meant to be a currency?

>If I don't use my FIAT to buy stocks or commodities which is also a hassle it loses value

You already said bitcoin is an asset. How is buying one asset with fiat any more of a ""hassle"" than buying another?

>I hate banks, they are slow

"Actually, I believe the crashes and bear markets strengthen bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) as a whole. Even in the short term I don’t think it’ll actually hurt anything (except for the weak hands and their weak feelings.). 

Bull markets are easy. They’re happy, positive, and exciting. Nothing about then is too scary. Bull markets are great because they bring in waves of new eyes and new money. That is what they’re best at. 

Bear markets is where the market actually grows and strengthens. After all the weak hands are shaken out there is always a substantial chunk of people who actually internalize what it means to “hodl”. Yeah, bear markets shake out the weak hands, but they also reveal the new, strong ones. 

>and permanently poison the well for lots of unsophisticated speculators who are going to lose everything.

Their wells will only be poisoned until the next bull market in which case they can either: 

a) Remain bitter fools and stubbornly ignore a shiny new technology that’s going to change the world (their loss). 

Or 

b) Admit that they were wrong and jump back on the hype train a stronger hand than ever. 

Either way I’m not worried or concerned with them. 

As for finding our price floor in the hundreds. I’m not optimistic that that’ll happen. Those sorts of prices are just so incredibly cheap and we’ve spent so long above 1k that I don’t think the space will mentally be able to justify prices below it. 

I imagine we dip below 1k for a very brief period of time, but I think we’ll find our floor somewhere in between 1k - 3k (leaning closer to 1k). ";1;0;False;Mowglio;dr0trbl;New to Bitcoin?

"Have to agree fully here. If I had to describe the landscape at the moment: Once bitcoin hit 10k and made the news a lot of people who had known about bitcoin but never bought in finally got in. This propelled it to 15k now this is where a lot of noobs got in (and where the technical problems for Coinbase started to happen.) Mainly driven by hype the price climbed pushed over night by S. Korea &amp; followed by the US in the morning it climbed $3000 in 15 minutes before Coinbase and Gdax both crashed and the price point was unsustainable so there was a crash. (I also suspect veterans seeing/recognizing the unnatural climb &amp; selling to profit and buy back in lower played in to the drop too.) Now, there’s a lot of people that own Bitcoin from $15,000-$19,900 who have never owned bitcoin before and do not know what it’s even about but felt fomo. You can see the effect this is having because every time Bitcoin reaches a new high weak hands sell. To get their $ back or sell for what they think is the most they’ll get because they fear losing it all. Bitcoin will not see a rapid climb like it did recently for quite a while. There will be a lot of weak hands along the way and the next few 1k marks will be tougher to reach than before. I think 15k is strong enough of a round achievement number that it won’t free fall out of that. But really who knows? Anyway, that’s just my take.";3;0;False;anicecoolfall;dr0o528;New to Bitcoin?

"Correct.

In computer science terms, increasing the block size is a `O(n)` (linearly) scaling solution (double the processing power/network/storage = double the transaction throughput) but due to Metcalf’s Law we need more on the order of `O(n^2)` (if not more) solutions as the number of users grows, to retain the same level of decentralization (which is the only thing that makes Bitcoin interesting).

But I also think Bitcoin is doomed to fail if we don’t have moderate block size increases.

The difference between BTC and BCH communities is it seems like BTC folks aren’t necessarily opposed to increasing the block size, they’re just very conservative about it (a good thing, IMHO), while BCH folks seem philosophically opposed to layered scaling approaches.";1;0;False;lightwad;dr0jwun;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"If whales can take BTC up 20% the first day futures trading halts will trigger and those short will be unable to exit their positions. If they can do it a second day shorts will still be unable to exit their positions and they'll get margin called as well. When people are short, underwater, and unable to exit their position their only recourse at offset is to buy the underlying causing BTC to explode further. Two days of 20% alone would easily take it to 21k or more. The reason some bankers were protesting the creation of BTC futures is because they too envisioned a scenario in which futures turn BTC into an even more unstoppable rocket. And if this happens all the people who sold it to avoid a pending crash will have nothing left to do but buy it back.

"Coinbase worst Costumer treatment on the WWW.

Assholes. They shut down my account cuz me and my gf made the same purchase twice so we wanted to cancel one.

On circle we cancelled right away.

On coinbase; Nope; Cannot Cancel. Then My bank, Bank of america closed all my accounts. Their reason? I shouldn't give someone my login.

But the real reason is making two purchases at once when I ddint' have enough. And I sent 20 email to coinbase to do it. I spammed bank of america to fix it.

Nothing. Shut down. No explanation, Everything shut down. And I am afraid now Cuz I am getting BoA letter; I don't even want to open them.

Coinbase: Biggest assholes in the planet they could have cancelled the transaction since it was going to take 11 days to do it (from routing number). They NEVER ONCE REPLIED TO MY MESSAGES.

Then they black balled me I can't use a bunch of other sites.

It's not any other reason I move all my coinbase to my private wallet on Electrum.

"I'm old, so I've watched these ""mania's"" play out many times.  I guess every generation has to learn the lesson over again.  It's sad really.  When this thing breaks there's going to be a path of destruction miles wide.

The thing that intrigues me is that oftentimes when these mania's come along there is some component of them that *actually does look different* (playing off of ""this time it's different"").  The thing that looks ""different"" with BTC is the fact that only 21M coins will ever be in circulation.  With the dot.com collapse the thing that looked different was the fact that there was entirely new technology as the driver (the WWW).  The housing collapse was a bit of an outlier.  But it's never ""different"".  It's actually the opposite, these collapses are *all the same*.  And BTC will be too.

Someday I will own BTC.  I'll own it as a means of digital currency for convenience sake.  The real reason for its existence BTW.

The hofstra illustration you linked to has been overlaid by different people onto the dot.com collapse, the Great Depression, the housing collapse, the South Sea Company, and others -- if fits like a glove.";1;1;False;slip_this_in;dr1iw5l;Bitcoin Plummets To Levels Unseen Since December 6, 2017!;7irvkt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7irvkt/bitcoin_plummets_to_levels_unseen_since_december/

"Be aware that ""financial professionals"" often manage money based on the commissions that they receive from the things that they are investing in.  Back during the dot.com boom there were a lot of people who got wiped out because they gave their money to a ""financial professional"" who then made a zillion trades in the space of a week, racking up enormous commissions and wiping out the money that was given to them in trust for investments.

Then there were a lot of lawsuits against the ""financial professionals"" for intentional mismanagement and breach of their fiduciary duties.  But such lawsuits rarely recover more than a small fraction of the initial balance.

And let's not forget the 2008 financial crisis, when the ""investment professional"" geniuses insisted on shoving retirees' money into high-yielding GM debt instruments just before GM declared bankruptcy, because ""these bonds are paying great yields!""

Never, ever trust a ""financial professional"" to manage things for your benefit.  They will manage it for their own benefit.  You have to make sure that their benefit aligns with your benefit.  Otherwise you WILL get fucked.

But if I were to make a thread about it be 100% sure people will downvote m to hell, however if I make a Meme saying OMG thank yoi bitcoin i bought a lambo guys! Upvotes like crazy. That is why now days I just reply to people like u/MicroToast that say things as they are. Holding is not a secret, everyone has a selling point. If you want to hold do it, if you feel like selling that is good too. Neither is worng, profit is profit and not everyone can hold forever.

"And that's why Satoshi will never be a unit. A bit will be.  Because most people in the Bitcoin community also get it wrong.

Because, a 100 Million Satoshis is 1 BTC, not a million.

However a million bits is a Bitcoin and a lot of major wallets and services already use bits. Bits and uBTC are the same. 1 mBTC = 1000 bits

Also the base unit of LN is 1 milli-satoshi, smaller than the smallest Bitcoin unit.


Simple way to remember everything

1 bit = 100 sats

1 Million bits = 1 Bitcoin

1000 bits = 1 mBTC

1000 mBTC = 1 Bitcoin

"I am bullish on Bitcoin but two things - never put more than 5% (tops) of your total portfolio in crypto - that is just common sense. So if you have 100K don't put more than 5 K in crypto. Also don't put more than say half of that crypto allocation into Bitcoin - diversify. There are other good crypto's out there - Ether, Litecoin, Ripple are possibilities.  Also I have latterly taken an interest in some of the more rare, exotic offerings like 42 though have not invested there yet. Bottom line crypto is not ""magic"" - it is an investment and belongs in a well diversified portfolio and again you should not only invest into BTC but other cryptocurrencies as well.

"It is really funny to read doom and gloom “Bitcoin plummets!” headlines when you know what was going on a few weeks ago. The media, and everyone who wants to get rich without thinking or doing anything have no perspective. 

I only just got into cryptos this summer. I actually missed the boat on mining Bitcoin early on when I had to spend some time in the hospital, but I’m happy. With various cryptocurrencies I’ve seen big returns since I’ve been in. I started with $80, lost $20, found a good coin to HODL, saw my $60 fall to $40, then over the next few months turn into $1,200. Depending on where I count from that’s x15-x20. That’s amazing ROI.

In all seriousness it depends on your age and the size. A young person with $1 million or less should put it in a low risk investment like index funds until they are ready to buy a house. Someone older should pay off their house and other debt then put the rest in bonds or index funds.

"You see- the key is to recklessly dump all your resources into a single investment, without any regard for logic. If things go south- just start calling it a scam, and blaming everybody in sight. 

The MOST important part - and I can’t stress this enough, is when a price even goes slightly down, PANIC. Start telling everybody how badly you’re sweating. And how you’re sick to your stomach.

You're completely right. What plenty of people fail to see though is that mainstream awareness of bitcoin is barely starting. When an interesting asset only has an adoption of ~1% in the developed world, there's still plenty of exponential growth on the horizon. If we go from ~1% to ~5% in the next couple of years, there will be exponential growth. If Wall Street money gets in, there will be exponential growth. The supply is too inelastic for anything else. The price of bitcoin will start stabilizing once most people and companies have gotten a chance to decide whether or not they want some bitcoins.;5;1;False;Exotemporal;dr1a24c;Bitcoin Plummets To Levels Unseen Since December 6, 2017!;7irvkt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7irvkt/bitcoin_plummets_to_levels_unseen_since_december/

You know in the netherlands you can have this thing done to you called cryothanasia. You get euthanized right next to your icy coffin and then get *woke*💯💯 up in the future. I know you were joking and didn't ask for this much detail, but I have to impart this wonderful knowledge upon my people: Since we're progressing in this field exponentially over time, we'll be able to wake you up around or shortly after 2045, which is when the technological singularity is supposed to take place (AI becoming godlike in intelligence, being able to solve any problem not provably mathematically unsolvable or deemed impossible due to the laws of physics). Sometimes I wish I could just be cryothanized right now tbh, knowing that I can easily get killed by a drunk driver and especially after seeing that daniel shaver video that went viral yesterday. I don't feel safe in this time in history. My brain can't decay in a frozen coffin and once I'm woken up and my mind is uploaded into a computer I'll be effectively immortal. You can argue that we'll kill ourselves with nuclear war or climate change, but once mind uploading is invented and allowed to the public, the Internet would have to permanently die in order for me to die, and we all know that won't happen.;4;2;False;rektumsempra;dr1obi1;Bitcoin Plummets To Levels Unseen Since December 6, 2017!;7irvkt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7irvkt/bitcoin_plummets_to_levels_unseen_since_december/

I probably shouldn't even dignify this with an answer. My mother was born two years after WW2 ended. She was three days old when our king was forced to abdicate by the communists and Soviet forces occupied my country. She was 42 when my country came out of the communist dictatorship. She lived a hard life in troubled times. Half of the world's population still does, living in poverty with basically no access to proper food or safe drinking water, let alone technology and information.

Extremely theoretically.

I doubt there's nowhere near the liquidity to cash even half of his Bitcoins. We're talking about 15+ Billions of USD, Bitcoin markets don't have such a liquidity.

Bitcoin has a 13 Billions volume daily if he started selling even just 1'000 bitcoins per day (so he'd take 3 years to sell them all) Bitcoin price would crash causing plenty of people to panic selling.
