The Federal Reserve is a public/private partnership with the major banks and much of its funding goes directly to those banks, not US Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve Act 1913 specifically provides a remedy for any 'elastic money' issued by the Fed in violation of the Constitution, redemption of Federal Reserve debt notes for 'lawful money' which can only be issued by the US Treasury Department.;1;0;False;marcus_of_augustus;dkscppg;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg
">Tl;dr: ""money"" is really ""debt"", and you can do a lot of fun things with it. 

Haha, you are so screwed ... you didn't just take the red pill, you're one of the guys handing them out to all the other debt slaves. Enjoy your bonded servitude.";1;0;False;marcus_of_augustus;dkscui5;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

"who's the shill?  Unlimited and all of these scams have proven, again, and again, to be completely lacking in integrity, worth, or even a shred of competence.

Not that you care, but for anyone else with an honest curiosity,
here are some links about Ver & Jihan's last hostile takeover attempt:

It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.

This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent ""devs"", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.

The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan & Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.

Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan & Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.

Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 

as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).";0;1;False;Terminal-Psychosis;dksitiq;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
