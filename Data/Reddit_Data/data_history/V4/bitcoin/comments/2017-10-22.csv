"You completely contradict yourself. You argue loss of value doesn't, in any way discourage savings, yet you point out someone who holds their saving in dollars would have lost 80% of their value, plus unrealized returns. 

You can't have it both ways. either the loss of value is a disincentive to save, or it isn't. You're essentially arguing someone with no financial sense, actually a complete moron, who is saving cash in a non-interest accruing account, will lose value.

That's not an argument, since such people will, necessarily, quickly be deprived of any wealth. Only the people saving via investment in interest bearing assets will survive, in the long run. Your argument directly supports the argument inflation is good for investment, and discourages currency hoarding.

"> Inflation exist tp encourage spending and encourage invrstment

That is a huge common misconception. The naive analysis would indeed conclude that inflation encourages spending and investment. In reality, inflation discourages people from keeping money. By definition this encourages ""spending"" and ""investment"" when you define ""spending"" and ""investment"" as any use of that inflationary asset (eg dollars). However, this definition also makes such a conclusion absolutely meaningless. 

Would less *real* investment happen when inflation is 0 or negative? Of course not. People still want to maximize the appreciation of their holdings. Read my comments here if you wanna know why I think so: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/73zrwr/the_deflationary_problem_preventing/dnukj46/

> inflation is marginal enough that its silly to suggest the average person is harmed by it

In the last, 30 years, any savings you had in dollars has decreased to 20% of its original worth. That is a ton of value. That's the power of exponential growth (or in this case, exponential value contraction). Suggesting that this is ""marginal"" is absurd to me. 

> expensive and complex to use

Have you no foresight? I'd argue that today its not that complex or expensive, but sure. In 5 years? Its gonna get pretty easy and pretty cheap. Have you not been keeping up with developments? Lightning network, etc?

> it will not replace the dollar.

This all stops people hoarding currency, and allows it to serve its purpose as a means of exchange.

No. Omg no. Invasions cost us trillions of dollars. Did the US as a whole really gain trillions from the Iraq War, for example? Also, what did the government gain? Neither the US nor the government as a whole gains buying power from things like the Iraq War. The gain is political support, distraction from other less savory issues, and kick backs for the military industrial complex. 

> all about preserving the status of the dollar

No. Its all about placating the US people, who have an interest in preserving the status of the dollar. It would be best for the people to have no inflation, but we the people are willing to accept a reasonable level of inflation in comparison to other countries.

"> either the loss of value is a disincentive to save, or it isn't

What I'm saying is that the same amount of investment will happen regardless of people's saving habits. If more people spend money faster because its currency is being inflated, more money is around and its value's decreasing by exactly the same amount as people's mad spending is increasing the velocity of money. If you have a deflationary currency, the opposite is true. The number of businesses started and projects built in the world doesn't change depending on how much inflation there is (ignoring any misuse of the inflation revenue that might happen).

Inflation neither causes people to buy more things, in the long run, nor causes more investment. It just causes more money to be needed to buy all those things.";1;1;False;fresheneesz;doprxmq;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

I noticed a few people seemed confused by the OP. Had I known this thread would blow up, I would have spent a little more time on the image to clarify that in the bottom section of the image, the primary big chain is supposed to represent the bitcoin core chain which is patched through majority consensus / soft forks. And the tiny purple chains represent all the hard forked chains (BCash, BGold, Segwit2X).

"[This article](https://hackernoon.com/why-the-brazilian-and-argentinian-bitcoin-communities-oppose-segwit2x-801edc213af8) has a very detailed and easy to understand list of objections for the Segwit2x.

I would add that there must be a block limit, otherwise the blockchain will be filled with transaction spam. So any proposals with unlimited block size are economically impossible (a proposals with minimum fees are equivalent with block size limit).  The limit must provide a balance between the interests of bitcoin users, miners, and those running the full nodes. The latter ones are unpaid and must bear the CPU, bandwidth and disk cost of verifying transactions (and are necessary, e.g., to check if the miners do not cheat so having miners only is not enough). With the increasing of the block size, the cost of running full nodes increase, discouraging this vital (unpaid) role. If the blockchain is so large that home users are unable to run the full nodes, only large centralized servers survive, creating a risk of bitcoin cartelization. 

There is probably some room for increasing the block size without making the  cost of running the full nodes too excessive but we have recently increased the effective block size by Segwit 1.0 and any other change should be well prepared and not forced upon the users by a handful of organizations.

"> Eventually blocks will be mined by legacy clients that break the newly-tightened rules. At that point the chain splits.

But the chain doesn't split into two long-running chains, instead the rule-breaking block just becomes orphaned and forgotten about: the blockchain following the new rules becomes longer, and the old clients and old miners switch to the longer chain that happens to be following the new rules. I just wanted to emphasize to others that segwit does not (directly) ever cause splits/forks like bch, bitcoin gold, s2x, etc, as long as a majority of the miners are following the new segwit rules.";1;1;False;AgentME;doqhidj;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png

"Do you have a computer you trust (one you can control the virus scanner and network access)? If so, install the Electrum client and launch it to create a new wallet. Upon startup it will walk you through creating a new ""seed phrase""; write that down in permanent ink on paper and put that paper in a bank safe deposit box.

If the amount of funds you have is small enough you're comfortable walking around with it and have a smartphone, install Mycelium (Android) or Breadwallet (iOS) and create an account there.

Once you have one of those set up, launch the app and go to the ""Receive"" tab. That will tell you your personal public key. Copy that and go to Coinbase. Go to the ""Send"" tab. Paste in the address you just copied as the destination. Send a small amount to test you did it all right, and if successful, send the rest of the amount you want to withdraw from Coinbase.
