I agree. Consumer protection should be found at the edge. Then one could choose the edge exchange with the level of consumer protection versus fees and other barriers that they are comfortable with. This is already how Bitcoin is working. One exchange may be super reliable, but have stiff requirements for identification, the correct type of bank account,  confirmation delays, etc, and the other may be trust based and not even require your name which can make a transaction in the same hour.

I don't think bitcoin equates to napster in that analogy -- paypal fits much better. Napster and paypal were both centralized and only as anonymous as an IP address. Bitcoin is more like limewire in that it is p2p and decentralized, but doesn't have as strict of protections for anonymity and fungibility as it should. Bittorrent addressed a lot of the problems that things like limewire experienced by massively decentralizing and distributing it's networks and making the protocol open source. While bitcoin is very distributed and based on an open-source protocol, it lacks the important changes necessary for dealing with transacting wealth, which is anonymity and fungibility of coins. My suspicion is that there will probably be an improvement to where ever bitcoin fails if the regulation neuters it too much. People have had a taste of true economic freedom, and that typically doesn't just go back to the way things were.;1;1;False;eitauisunity;cdi9nu8;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

">That said, let's not pretend that Bitcoin is not going to completely collapse the central banking system, or that such an eventuality is ""bad"" for society.

I respectfully disagree.  I know it flies in the face of the more die-hard Libertarian/Crypto-anarchists and their goals in regard to the outcome of Bitcoin, but I fully believe that Bitcoin can work along side the US dollar and not pose a threat to it.  I believe that Bitcoin can increase the GDP of the US, decrease the middlemen (PayPal, Dwolla, etc.) in financial transactions and revolutionize the payment industry.  

Will this cause banks to collapse?  Possibly, I doubt it though.  In the same way other world currencies fluctuate compared to each other, so will the rate of USD/BTC, BTC/EU, and vice versa.  It's understandable that we'll be treading new ground because inflationary central reserve currencies will be competing with deflationary decentralized Bitcoin, but I don't see some mass exodus for a new internet-based currency happening any time soon.

This is an incredibly important thing to be aware of, and I was somewhat relieved by the hearings yesterday being predominantly positive, but I fear things are going to go too slow and that China will own this economy. If China were freer than the US in other ways, that'd be awesome...but, China is the much worse of two very dangerous regimes.

"The huge, actual problems were caused, in general, either by a total lack of regulation or by a lack of up-to-date regulation in the field of financial derivatives. When a mortgage company can sell a mortgage to Joe Borrower, then turn around and divide it up into securities to sell to investors in order to recoup its principal, suddenly that mortgage company doesn't have to care about whether or not Joe Borrower can actually pay back that money. This complete breakdown of economic incentives resulted in abuses at all levels, from borrowers lying about income to mortgage brokers getting people into loans they couldn't afford to Goldman Sachs selling mortgage-backed securities which were known to be garbage to investors.

The point is that regulations *have* to be up to date. If they're not, they'll not only potentially miss the new dangers that innovation has brought about (as we saw with the financial crisis), they also risk crushing positive innovations before they can get started (as we're seeing in the Bitcoin space). It's critical to have the correct regulatory balance to maintain economic stability while not undermining prosperity. (The problem is that many people can make a very large amount of money doing things that put stability at risk, and others have a vested interest in using overregulation to stifle competition, even if it hurts the overall economy.)";8;1;False;Spherius;cdi800y;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"The political elites would have treated the printing press (and did once they realized the impact of it too late) with a large amount of hostility. What you seem to fail to realize is that government is in the business of keeping the costs of compliance low so that they can profit off of systematic aggression. They even often do this with the genuine belief that they are doing it for society's own good. 

Decentralized systems that make it hard to control education, information, wealth, and productivity are dangerous to any state, and the sooner they realize how much of an undoing bitcoin can be to them, the more likely they are to want to neuter it's profound implications, or (if it gets bad enough for them) to simply take up policy in an attempt to shut it down altogether.

Mark my words: Making a deal with the devil of statism and inviting them into the progress this technology has made will be a mistake that will set back the profound paradigm changes that bitcoin can make, or snuff it out completely.

"The fear of where they will crack down will only inspire a better armament of technologies for us to protect ourselves from them.

"The assumption you are making is that the only reason why bitcoin has developed into what it is today is because of that white paper. Satoshi was a necessary but insufficient element of bitcoin's development.

In all honesty, to keep a more accurate analogy, Paypal is to napster, as bitcoin is to limewire, as some other futer crypto currency is to bittorrent. I think that it might be necessary for the state to show their prowess in fucking things up, and doing so with bitcoin for this community to learn it was a bad idea and develop something better.

"I prefer letting Bitcoin tell its own narrative. A forerunner to Bitcoin was Wei Dai's b-money protocol (see footnote 1 of Satoshi's whitepaper). His post to the Cypherpunk mailing list did not begin by listing the merits of a frictionless payment system, even though that was very much a component of the protocol. Instead he made reference to Tim May's work and how such a money protocol could be used to help for crypto-anarchic communities.

>I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ""anarchy"", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

>Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services can be provided to and by untraceable entities.

http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt

As /u/PierreRochard points out, the rules of the protocol clearly choose policies typically espoused by anarcho-capitalists and other advocates of sound money, rather than supporters of central banking and other governmental monetary institutions.

Different parts of the story appeal to different people, and you should tell that story accordingly. Don't act like the other parts do not exist though. If and when those people who get into Bitcoin are interested to know *why* it works as a protocol, it will be Austrian economics and libertarian legal theory that best informs them, not any statist policy or philosophy.";2;0;False;bitstein;cdi7jb9;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"Bitcoin is not just a currency but its own transaction system. Currently, people use credit cards or bank accounts to transfer money from one party to another online. This kind of online banking and e-commerce is merely applying old, pre-existing systems using a computer to provide some added convenience to the user.

On the other hand, bitcoin runs on a system more robust and transparent that does not require a middleman to make a transaction. The money ""lives"" in a computing device, and transactions are traceable and final. Compare this to having your money stored in a bank, where you rely on a third party for access and your computer is just showing you numbers on the screen but the bank has the authorization and possession of your money. **Bitcoin is literally digital currency as opposed to a digital representation of hard currency.**

With bitcoin, you are your own bank. And everyone is able to look at the ledger of transactions in all its history. But central banks don't need to worry, because with smart support and smart regulations, third parties can offer services to people who are not yet confident in managing large amounts of digital currency by themselves. For instance, you can currently allow a third party service to entrust your bitcoins, but it is not customary for most services to insure them up to a given amount. I believe services like these need to take hold in order to gain widespread adoption.

Finally, while the internet has greatly increased the ""liquidity"" of great ideas- if you can express it that way- the practical case is that you often need money to fund great ideas. Now put two and two together and you can see how bitcoin would naturally work in a more connected world.";2;0;False;ccricers;cdi8lwp;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"I actually built a complete wallet system that would let phone numbers proxy for Bitcoin addresses.  Then the State of NY started sending out letters to everyone they could find with ""Bitcoin"" in the name accusing them of being unlicensed money transmitters in the state of NY, which I'm nowhere close to.  However, the system I wrote could potentially have had customers in NY state, so I had to take that threat seriously.

So, I sold the software I'd written for a pittance, to a person in another country who could actually do something with it.  There's nothing a small business owner can do directly in the Bitcoin space in a regulatory environment where every state insists that any company that touches Bitcoin directly must register with them, and specifically comply with every law and regulation on every state's books.

My point is that the current byzantine regulatory framework doesn't just have the *potential* for shipping American ideas and jobs overseas, but that it is *already happening.*

If there were federal-level clarity about what rules and regs must be followed, and an explicit wall preventing one state from extending its legal dominion onto businesses in other states, that would be a huge step forward.

"I just watched you on Cspan, thank you for representing us as a knowledgeable community!

In regards to policy making, what you should understand is that the government will never be **able** to prevent Bitcoin from becoming mainstream. 

As an analogy, consider music downloading. Many laws were passed that attempted to prevent peer to peer filesharing. That has not diminished the fact that millions of people pirate music every day. The only way to win against peer to peer sharing is to provide a service that has a higher benefit/cost ratio than piracy does. You can charge money and provide extra features (eg itunes) or you can have advertisements (spotify, pandora, etc).

The government needs to show that it's worth going through some amount of governmental control when using Bitcoin. If there are benefits to spending being tracked by the US gov (eg federal guarantees) then we will voluntarily use it. If however, there are severe detriments to spending being tracked by the US gov (slower transaction times, exchange freezes, taxes) then we will simply go around whatever system the US gov puts in place. 

Personally I doubt that the government will be able to regulate Bitcoin in an elegant manner, since Bitcoin is everything it needs to be already, and any government involvement will cause significant friction. The recent NSA scandals exacerbate chances for regulation, as these scandals have undermined trust in the government, and provided impetus for becoming even more anonymous.

Bitcoin lowers barriers to participation in internet commerce for the unbanked.  Any merchant or individual with internet access can use Bitcoin or accept it as payment without needing to pay a bank for the privilege.  

A merchant who accepts payments with Bitcoin is immune to credit card chargeback fraud.  A consumer who uses Bitcoin does not expose himself to identity theft the way he does every time he uses his credit card.

"**Inevitably drug dealing gets brought up** It must be acknowledged that a tool can be abused. Hammers kill people but have legitimate uses. Dollars are used to sell drugs but have legit uses. 

**Tor** is the anonymizing software and network that runs most of the deep web. The place that drugs have been bought and sold with bitcoins. However most of the **TOR networks funding comes from the US government** as it has legitimate uses. The network fees those in repressive regimes from censor ship and allows them to communicate with the world. The network is used by journalist to report from tyrannical states and frees people from the threat of death for expressing their opinions. 
This network is also the network used to distribute *child porn, drugs, lethal weapons* and much more.

The moral of this is that the government continues to fund TOR because it has **legitimate** uses that far outweigh its negatives. I hope this can be recognized and be applied to bitcoins. Even though there may be some negatives it is far out weighted by the positives. 

This is not to say any negative should be ignored but please acknowledge that even if a government bands bitcoin it will not stop the bitcoin trade. Make the best of this and regulate appropriately.

1. Bitcoin has a lot of innovative features that make it a powerful financial technology.  It's truly a [programmable currency](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts).

There's lots of room in this space for job-creating innovation, if the regulation in this space isn't too arduous a barrier to entry for start-ups.

2. Because Bitcoin is public, it provides law enforcement with many tools for tracking down criminals.  Because it is pseudonymous, the origin of transactions is not always immediately obvious, so there's privacy.  Bitcoin does change the challenges law-enforcement faces, but it's not a boon to criminals.

Bitcoin has been covered very well by some of the comments already on this post.  One main point that I think will be important in the next few years is the position of the U.S. on crypto-currency and the development and infrastructure of it.

"I don't know if this will even get looked at but I figure I might as well try.

There's a big tension within Bitcoin right now. It is meant to act as a currency and it is a fantastic currency in theory. Because it's great in theory, a lot of people are ""investing"" in it to reap the future rewards of its use as a currency. So some people have started seeing it as a commodity instead of a currency because most of what they see is this ""investing"" thing and not its use as a medium of exchange. 

So if I have one thing to ask you is to consider it a currency, not a commodity. Regulatory agencies should not need any new powers to treat with the downsides of a new currency. Banks don't need new regulations to exchange a new currency. All the laws are already in place, we just need congress or a judge to clarify that Bitcoin is indeed a currency and can be treated just like any other currency. The fact that people ""invest"" in it is no different from people ""investing"" in Yen, Euros, Pesos, etc. Thanks for stopping by!";2;0;False;GRANITO;cdiaopy;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"Dear Senator,
Thanks for reaching out!  Here are a couple of important lessons that I've learned about bitcoin since I started trading it six months ago:
 1. It is BOTH a store of wealth and a payment system.  Gold and cash are only stores of wealth, you needed a horse or FedEX to transport sizable quantities.  Visa and Paypal are only payment systems, you need to have an account with fiat currency to use them. Bitcoin is BOTH!  Store of wealth and payment system rolled into one!  Hugely innovative!
 2. The core innovation of bitcoin is the ""bitcoin protocol"" which enables 1000s of distributed computers to authenticate trades of scarcely-available bitcoins via a public ledger.  This discovery is equal in importance to the TCP/IP protocol, otherwise known as the ""internet protocol"".
 3. Prediction: This core innovation will lead to the creation of a new ""financial internet"" equal in importance to the original internet, the social internet, or the mobile internet. There will be 1000s of new businesses built-on-top of this core innovation. America needs to be the center of this innovation!  Not the laggard!

Bitcoin can be transmitted anywhere without the need for expensive 3rd party wiring services such as PayPal or Western Union.  If you have ever been screwed over by one of these services, or if you simply dislike paying expensive currency exchange fees while traveling, Bitcoin is right for you.  It is difficult to counterfeit, it is not burdened by inflation (think owning gold), and it can revolutionize both the world economy and all the banking systems.;2;0;False;Cygnus_X;cdi87ye;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"Senator, it is important to ask FinCEN if AML and KYC laws were even necessary to bring down Silk Road, and what point there was to taking it down if there were no less than three replacements a week later. It looks like regulations didn't really bring down Silk Road. Instead, good old-fashioned gumshoe detective work did.

Wouldn't it be better to take the same ""hands off"" approach to Bitcoin like Canada and China rather than seeing a brain drain of all of us leaving to go work in other countries? Keep in mind that FinCEN's job is to prosecute, your job is ensure the future of the country isn't bleak for those under 30, who are presently looking at paying for the expenses of older and larger generations.

As an old Bitcoin miner and large holder, I foresee a future where FinCEN, AML, and KYC regulations force me to leave, not to mention whatever the IRS ends up doing. I actually don't mind paying my taxes, but if I can see significantly lower taxes by operating out of Singapore or Thailand, why should I remain in the US? Additionally, while I may not be young myself, who do you think I am going to hire and where I'm going to ask them to move once I am situated?

Don't just take this as a ""we can keep the same route and not stifle innovation"" solution. You can't. China has a freer market in money than the US right now and it is no secret amongst Bitcoiners. It will only be a matter of time before the rest of the public realizes this as well. You have a chance to fix this problem before it gets out of hand, but you need to do it immediately.

Bitcoin is not meant for any illegal purpose. Any more than the internet itself is meant for illegal purposes. They both are just technological tools to make things easier. The shutdown of Silk Road had very brief and minimal effect on the bitcoin 'economy'.

"Cryptocurrencies are here to stay in one way or another. 

There are too much money to save and too many advantages for people, not just in one country but all over the world, that it will be impossible to make it go away. People will use this technology no matter what laws in various countries say.

"We're amid the greatest transfer of wealth in history and the United States is not part of that flow.  The inability for US users to buy, sell and trade bitcoin legally ought to be seen as an urgent matter of national security.

Immediate action is needed at the federal level to, at least temporarily: 1. exempt bitcoin exchangers from state money transmission laws; 2. exempt banks from liability surrounding their bitcoin business customers.

The United States does not have a year to wait and see if any domestic business can manage to get licensed as a money transmitter in every state.  There are businesses able and willing to obey the rules, combat money laundering and protect consumer interests (See Digital Asset Transfer Authority SRO initiative) but they don't have the licenses do to it legally, and they don't have the banks willing to back them.

Banks need clear guidance and encouragement to take bitcoin business, and bitcoin businesses need to know that they're not risking prison time by operating before they have their licenses in every state.

"Senator,

What is easy to overlook is that whether bitcoin is regulated, remains in a grey-area, or is free from regulation, people who want to use it for illegal activities will always be able to do so unhindered.

Take the Silk Road, for example, and consider whether drug traders care if bitcoin is living up to its full potential as a cheap, fast, global payment processor, remittance service (and MUCH more) or whether it becomes a currency used only for illegal transactions. Bad guys can launder $10,000 worth of one-dollar bitcoins just as easily as they can launder $10,000 worth of one-thousand-dollar bitcoins.

In other words, bitcoin, just like a firearm, and just like the internet, legal or not, can be used for harm. Protecting us from that should remain under the traditional purview of law enforcement, not in restricting our freedom. 

What we, and the rest of the world, would like to learn from these hearings is that the federal government embraces bitcoin for the good that bitcoin can do, and recognizes the evil as an inevitability of human nature.

"Hi Mr. Moran,

I am a small business owner in the State of Ohio. I use Bitcoins because in an online world, other forms of payment haven't adapted to changes in the market, and we are still working with archaic models by credit card companies. These companies charge very large fees, of which the [Frank-Dodd bill](http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus78-new-rules-electronic-payments-lower-costs-retailers) attempted to reduce for the consumer, as well as the business owner. 

Bitcoin represents a new way to transact money for essentially non-existent transaction fees, which help businesses transact in the global economy. If I work with a major company such as Chase PaymenTech, my costs to do business with customers can vary from 1.5% to 3.5%. With Bitcoin, its 0% to 1.0%. This represents a sizable cost savings for my business. The same can be said for transacting in B2B services as well, which again is very sizable. 

If the US restricts Bitcoins from being usable in the United States to transact with, then global competitors will easily undermine my business, and many others, as we will continue to lag behind other countries' willingness to embrace new technology. Bitcoins represent a paradigm shift in regards to online transactions. I hope that the US embraces it, rather than rejects it, as it will hurt us more than our fears of the currency.";13;0;False;mrstickball;cdiaqyk;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"Identity theft could be a thing of the past. A protocol like bitcoin can stop it. Now you give your debit card info on the net it's taken and stored in a not so perfectly secure server. By the thousands they can be stolen and sold on the black market and accounts can be emptied out or used for illegal purposes.
Why? Every Time you hand over your debit card info you have over the keys to the whole account and the merchant pulls out what you agreed to. Bitcoin is different you send out only what you want to send out and you never toss anyone the keys and hope for the best.

Personal finance guru Dave Ramsey say it nearly every episode, ""Never Give a debt collector electronic access to your bank account (like you would your power company or phone company) because *they will empty it COMPLETELY* regardless of what terms you agreed to on the phone""

">  I fully believe that Bitcoin can work along side the US dollar and not pose a threat to it. 

If Bitcoin reduces the marginal demand for dollars by 10% it will have a disastrous effect on the dollar's value.

For dollars/euros to compete against bitcoins in a currency crisis the Fed would have to increase interest rates dramatically. Read more about the future here: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2248419

Bitcoins and dollars are in direct, ferocious competition over a fixed pie. Dollar currently has a monopoly, any increase in bitcoins' marketshare is a direct decrease in the dollar's marketshare.

USD/EUR cannot compete because it would require them to revamp their payments system to cut out middlemen, middlemen who have complete regulatory capture over central banks.";1;0;False;;cdi78wj;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"As someone who doesn't live in the US I would say it is important to use as little regulation as possible. Bitcoin is an international phenomenon and too many legal restrictions/regulation will stifle innovation, create unnecessary barriers to entry and put Americans at a competitive disadvantage. China is already looking to be major player and like the rest of the world, will continue to develop and take advantage of the economic freedom bitcoin provides. Bitcoin will be good for all humanity by empowering individuals to cooperate economically on a global scale like never before. It removes the middleman and gatekeepers and creates a true free market. The bankers of bitcoin future will provide layered services and infrastructure that add value and consumer protections, however their patronage will be optional and not required for basic commerce.

Obviously we don't want bitcoin to be used by criminals, but there has to be a balance between protections and maintaining the bastion of freedom and liberty that bitcoin represents.

"Mr Moran, please read this: [US has Already Ceded Dominance in Bitcoin Trading](http://www.coindesk.com/us-already-ceded-dominance-bitcoin-trading/)

**The US has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes (~25%), yet only ~2% of Bitcoin trades are happening in its jurisdiction.** The reason for this are the absurd, utterly expensive, slow and complicated regulatations business need to comply with. Just read about how hard it is to become a Money Transmitter all over the country to have an idea of what I'm talking about.

Meanwhile, in Canada, Bitcoin is flourishing. They even have [Bitcoin ATMs there](http://www.vancouversun.com/100K+traded+through+Vancouver+Bitcoin+week+with+video/9145774/story.html). Why? Because the [Canadian financial authority decided not to regulate Bitcoin](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039347/canadian-regulator-takes-lighter-view-of-bitcoin.html). Their Bitcoin business need no special licenses to operate. Recently, Hong Kong's financial authority just [said the same](https://medium.com/p/75eec794482). And in Germany, [bitcoins are exempt from capital gains taxes after one year](http://www.coindesk.com/german-government-relieves-capital-gains-tax-on-bitcoin-positions/). I've personally heard of bitcoiners moving to Germany after this, taking their money with them.

It's not only in Bitcoin related business that the US is staying behind. Economic freedom as a whole has been falling fast in the US during the last decade. Just check the data from the [Fraser Institute](http://www.freetheworld.com/2013/EFW2013-complete.pdf) or the [Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/index/).

The first currency and money system in the world which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer.

Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary.

"The situation for entrepreneurs looking to build startups around bitcoin seems pretty bleak here in the US. I'm a developer in San Francisco and go to various bitcoin meetups, and it's depressing that in conversations sometimes it seems like the most rational decision if you want to build a business is to decide that you're going to have to leave the US to do so.

It's not just the uncertain (and overbearing) laws that weren't designed with something like bitcoin in mind that are the problem — it's that the legacy banking system here is (obviously) not playing nice with people trying to start legitimate bitcoin businesses.

"Mr. Senator,

As far as illegal activities and money laundry goes, I do understand that it is in your constituent's best interest to stop any of those activities and while it is said that the Bitcoin contributes to it (silk road being the best example), even if there will be talk about regulating the Bitcoin then I would like to bring the following to your attention: the US dollar banknote is still the easiest and by far the most anonymous way to make illegal trading and if the Bitcoin does become regulated, other then the fact that it will hurt the Bitcoin it will also not do anything to reduce illegal activities as if people switched from the USD to the BTC to i.e. buy drugs, they can as easily switch back to the USD.

Moreover, regulating the Bitcoin will hurt it a lot but not only the Bitcoin community but also the body that is trying to regulate it as it will require a lot of time and effort and to have a big regulation over the BTC is next to impossible as due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of it.

"Mr. Moran - thank you for reaching out to the Bitcoin community. If you would ever like further information from an insider, please contact me on skype (same username).

What I would like you to know is this: The invention of a decentralized monetary system will go down in history as one of the most important inventions of all time. Humans rarely recognize great achievements when they happen - who would've known how extremely different the world would look after the printing press, or the micro-processor, or the airplane? Decentralized currency is a similarly revolutionary invention.

The way that this will change the world is unknown. What it does, in effect, is to change the economic relationship between individuals around the world. It will have pros, and perhaps cons. It will generate tremendous wealth, and it will improve the lives of average people. It may even solve many of the seemingly-unrelated issues with which world leaders grapple unsuccessfully. 

This is not just another PayPal. This is something special. Please treat it the way you would have hoped the political elites would have treated the printing press so long ago.

"Jerry,
In regards to what is being spoken about right now at the hearing.  The best approach to taxing Bitcoin would be to tax at the point of sale.  The transaction can be broken up at the point of sale, with a percentage of the transaction going to the merchant and a portion to the government.  This would allow for income taxes and the mess associated with them to be eliminated.  Those who hold BTC won't hesitate to pay for their item in BTC knowing that they won't have to pay income/capital gains tax, and it is likely that their holdings have appreciated since purchased.  Different tax rates could be implemented geographically, and the system could be implemented at the payment processor level (Coinbase/Bitpay).

One person pays for the dinner in Bitcoin, one person pays with credit card and the third pays using cash. 

1. The restaurant can deposit that Bitcoin purchase into their bank account in minutes. 

2. The credit card payment will take at least 2-3 days to deposit into the bank account with varying fees. 

3. The cash payment may take longer depending on the size of the restaurant and it's operating schedule. Armored cars may be required to pick up the cash which will take the deposit much longer to reach the bank.

The end result: Using the rapid transfer of funds with Bitcoin enhances the speed and purchasing power of the economy as a whole. The lag in available funds is in minutes and no longer in days.

The economy can benefit more than anyone can imagine. The US should not hesitate on this.";1;0;False;iamcoinpanel;cdi6vw7;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"the economic aspects of bitcoin are clever. the code itself takes the place of the federal reserve regarding inflation and spurring the economy.

No amount of quantitative easing will be able to spur economic growth in a refined and predictable way as this algorithm can.

new bitcoin is distributed in a finite and known amount called the ""block reward"". All blocks contain a block reward, as well as transactions that have occurred since the previous block, and all those transactions can choose to be processed at higher priority for a bitcoin fee. The aggregate fees from those transactions are included in a block.

whoever (or the group of whoevers) finds the block earns the block reward and the aggregate fees. As the block reward decreases over time, the # of transactions with fees has to increase to make up for the block reward earnings.

This feature of the protocol alone gives all bitcoin holders an incentive to improve the infrastructure of bitcoin to do things that make more transactions happen (grow the economy). This is completely independent of the speculative aspects of the exchange rate.

The transaction fees earned per block can be a lot greater than the block reward. Currently the block reward is 25 bitcoin, and the average transaction fees earned per block are .25 bitcoin. The block reward will halve in 2016 to 12.5 bitcoin per block. We would like to see the aggregate earned transaction fees per block be a lot greater, but there will be a time when the transaction fees match the block reward, whether it is the year 2080 or 2140 when the block reward has halved to 0.5 bitcoin, and the transaction fees still only account for .25 - 0.5 bitcoin per block. Or whether a combination of other events occur and each block contains 12+ bitcoin of aggregate transaction fees.

By the time the final bitcoin is rewarded, it is expected that the other earnings within each block will be much greater than that 1 bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin. This helps ensure that bitcoin will continue flowing through its economy.

"I'm sure that you've heard some things concerning tax evasion, drugs, and money laundering with Bitcoin.

**The great thing for  the US government is that Bitcoin is perfectly, permanently, and infinitely traceable.  By bringing it under existing AML and KYC regulations ( require ID of customers, recordkeeping, and audits, collectively called ""greenlisting"" by bitcoiners), you can pretty much kill money laundering, eliminate tax evasion, easily invalidate money from terror groups, tax evaders, dissidents, etc.**

You're going to need help from existing private industry to work hand in glove with the government to implement compliance with IMOLIN and other control and tax mechanisms.  

I for one know there is a lot of people within the Bitcoin community that are not paying their fair share of taxes, but with adequate and simple regulation you can help curb tax evasion and terrorism using Bitcoin.  The three substantive changes are:

1.  Immediately apply AML and KYC to all businesses that want to transact in Bitcoin.  Require merchants to only accept Bitcoin from addresses that have identities of real people assigned to them.  Enforce this greenlisting using random audits.  Save the customer ID and address information in a central database.  I'm sure the NSA can help you with this.

2.  Using the information in #1, begin enforcement of a US bitcoin blacklist, and prohibit US merchants from transacting in Bitcoin that has transited known terrorists, drug dealers, money launderers (also called ""bitcoin laundries""), and tax evaders.  Make it so these people cannot spend their Bitcoin in the US.

3.  Eliminate the statute of limitations for tax evasion.  With Bitcoin's perfect transaction ledger, it is easy to prosecute someone for tax evasion that happened 10 years ago.  You can even do it retroactively, when you find an illegal tax shelter you can walk back through the blockchain to find more evaders and blacklist their money too!

We should all be thankful that the Bitcoin Foundation has created a currency with such useful and practical surveillance tools embedded in it for governments everywhere to use to keep our citizens safe and fight tax evaders and terrorists.
