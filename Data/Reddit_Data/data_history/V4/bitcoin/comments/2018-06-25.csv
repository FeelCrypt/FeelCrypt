">I was very specific about what I said. What you imply from that is your own fault not mine.

""And they shouldn’t have, make money and get out, buy back in with less stress.""

That's sounds like you think he did well.

> Copy and pasting a definitions but using them incorrectly does not constitute understanding.

I used it in the way I intended. Once again you are skirting a point. Would you prefer I produced my own dictionary definition?

>I skirted nothing

You haven't rebutted a thing I said. Just tiresome diversionary tactics.

As for being aware of Bitcoin's characteristics, I've been in it for 6 years you honestly believe I don't know it's finite, deflationary and censorship-resuitant? Give me a fucking break.

>That’s objectively false, you should feel ashamed for even writing such a pitiful statement.

Now you are getting boring. And unquestionably quite wrong. Greg done fucked up.";0;1;False;ebaley;e1a89km;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

"Firstly, I downvoted you because each of my comments have been immediately downvoted. And it can be only be you as you are bound to see my answers before most.

>About what? I never told anyone an investment strategy.

No? You implied that the piddling amount Greg made was satisfactory and that he was just as well off not to wait two more years.

>Learn what cop out means before you use it please

""an instance of avoiding a commitment or responsibility"" 

That sounds like your attitude.

>Nobody anywhere in this comment chain is talking about that other than you, so this statement is largely irrelevant and even, in fact, copy and pasted from someone else and not even an original thought.

Who says it has to be an original thought? And copy and pasted from where? Show me the source. Wouldn't make it wrong anyway. You're skirting the issue here anyway with these kind of answers. Greg was an ass for not holding. At least something. Period.

You were wrong about not investing in Bitcoin earlier. Just admit it. This hindsight bias stuff is a cop out.

So you’re advocating trading to the average guy. He’s just going to either keep the fiat or buy back in if he sees it going up 10 dollars. ;0;1;False;ebaley;e18se24;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

I'm talking about the average person who buys some coins, then sees the price fall a few dollars, panic sells, then buys back in at a higher price. Usually only in a bubble is the price constantly rising. If you don't what you are doing either don't buy at all or hold. If you can take a quick profit great. But as the post above says don't be like Greg. Always hold some at least.;0;1;False;ebaley;e18tb45;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

I haven’t missed your point. And it isn’t bias. Many in the past made sound predictions for Bitcoin to increase greatly in value in the future. Even the likes of Hal Finney. You and a few others missed the point of the op’s post. Sure many have sold after a quick profit. But don’t be like them - or like Greg. ;0;1;False;ebaley;e19el71;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

The thing is that here almost no one invest in crypto for long term. People sell bitcoins for fiat to buy food mostly and more wealthy people sell them to buy maybe a phone or clothes but basically everyone that sells btc is to expend that fiat almost inmediately unless they are exchanging those btc for usd (it's not rare to see people that have american bank accounts, specially people that were able to travel before the crisis). Here it's common to see a whole family living of the mining profits of an antminer or a few gpus because what a job can pay you here is ridiculous (as an electronic engineer the most I could earn working for a company is around 10-20$ a month);2;1;False;jcabia;e1a81ua;FACT: Even if you bought Bitcoin at 20k in Venezuela, you're still better off than if you just held Bolivars.;8sh4om;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sh4om/fact_even_if_you_bought_bitcoin_at_20k_in/
