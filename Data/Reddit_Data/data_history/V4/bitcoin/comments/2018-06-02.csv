Life is like a portfolio of alts; you never know what you are going to gethat you are going to get and as I can consider myself as an expert in field of Crypto Sales, so I can give you some advice so if you need my recommendation, I can say you that you need to pay more attention to Socratus. It is a insurance ecosystem which provide a digital platform with instant claim payment products for insurance companies

"Listen to what the patent examiner says in the movie ""The Patent Scam"" on netflix.

Examiners have an average of 4 hours for each patent and they assume the patent is valid unless they can find previous patents in the record for the same thing.

Thus things that were  so obvious that they were never patented like throwing a stick for a dog to chase get patented and not refused.

The real solution would be make it trivial to get  a patent invalidated. All one should have to do with no filing fee is submit proof the idea existed before such as a time stamped public discussion on reddit or magazine article or publishedbook etc. So ""see spot fetch stick"" published in 1962  would be an invalidating submission on the dog stick patent (which actually exists)";1;0;False;dswdswdsw;dzzhjwb;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

I hope Cryptogreetings will confirm this to all to help progressing the other hunters.
Now, the removed clue nº8 is very confusing, is it really to ‘simplify’ the solution’? Please cryptogreetings clarify because  all belive it is to remove the optional passphrase. If we now try solving the derivation path and in fact a passphrase is still needed then we will guess endless. I would prefer that he keeps with the passphrase and makes this clear!

"I think whoever posted the, ""P=NP"" was inferring that a code breaking algorithm isn't going to crack this puzzle since this math logic implies no one can currently break cryptography used in BTC let alone a ""random walk"" program going through this word map puzzle image.

I was just posting this for anyone who wondered like I did about that, ""P=NP"" post a while back. I was not implying in using it to solve this puzzle, I agree it has nothing to do with this puzzle other than proofing its difficulty. Though, I think the concept of utilizing a ""checksum"" *maybe* useful in narrowing down the combo of words chosen to try for the mnemonic phrase seed. The question is, does this image give us the number for the checksum?

"Did y'all know there are a ton of similarities between maritime conceptually named ideas and BitCoin ideas? For example they both utilize mnemonic tools, there's even ""nodes"" too. Not to mention memorization sayings like voting:
https://www.mnemonic-device.com/navigation/nautical-can-dead-men-vote-twice-at-elections-or-true-virgins-make-dull-companions-add-whiskey/
(granted the other way of this phrase is rapey and misogynistic, so be forewarned to any triggers -- yikes)

Anyway, so what if there's a home, a destination marked as ""x"", as well as a place upon the image as a map where the hypothetical ship has been lost? Thus, maybe we need to employ the method of finding our ""bearings"" like this:
https://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch08_angles/07_bear/bearing.htm

If I had a ""compass rose"" I might guess to place it upon the missing glyph box symbol -- or where this elusive ""x"" lays at on this image map. Granted this maybe done by merely a ruler, a protractor, and a math-compass (the two feet you'll need to walk the plank aka the ""rhumb line(s)""). I think this math is based in trigonometry, of which I don't know either.
