Oh and let me remind you, that as a kid, I did participate in an actual non violent revolution, where it was safe, my parents participated in situation where it was not safe, and there were people (one girl stuck in my mind for life) actually crushed underneath the tracks of the tanks fighting for freedom, so I am a little skeptical of your righteousness.

"There were polls done pre-2013 and you are not wrong on those estimates. I do remember one particular poll on Bitcointalk at the time in 2011 or 2012. I think it did determine something like 95% of Bitcoiners were male, but a good number of the commentators in that forum did say their wives or girlfriends were interested as well, but just didn't like commenting on forums online.

It's probably worthwhile to note particular idiosyncrasies between the genders like that. It's not that most women don't participate in Bitcoin, it's that they don't participate in the online forums and social media aspects, perhaps preferring meatspace interactions, instead.

"> are all fields where men gravitate to and women find less interesting

&nbsp;

Just gonna throw this out, but you're ascribed an emotional response that comes from the environment that /u/dreamendDischarger is trying to discuss here. It's factual to say 'are all fields that are male-dominated' but when you said 'are all fields that women find less interesting' you're talking about the emotional response of an entire gender (which is hard to measure by itself), and you're also not considering that emotional response might be different if the environment of these male-dominated fields was different

&nbsp;

Separately of the way that statement claims knowledge on something that's impossible to measure, I know you yourself have to have to have been hit with this type of shit at some point in your life outside of the fields you're talking about - everyone gets it sometime even if they don't always recognize it. Shitty things like: You like country music and you drive a truck, so what are you doing trying to be a lawyer? You're black and driving a nice car, what are you doing in this nice neighborhood? You're white and have a penis, what could you possibly understand about discrimination? You're young. You're old. You're female. You're not from around here. You're a non-believer.

&nbsp;

Is it that hard to believe that women get hit with 'what could you know about X?' in these fields until they don't want to deal with it anymore?

"It doesn't motivate people to not express their viewpoints though. If you decide to Tweet that black people are violent, and 50 people tweet back telling you your opinion is stupid then they're just exercising their free speech.

If someone wants to go out with a loudspeaker calling for a genocide then they're not just being un-PC, they're calling for violence and should rightfully feel afraid to express their opinion.

I don't think anyone's calling for you to not express your opinions, just to be mindful that you don't use racial slurs. That's really not too hard to ask and anyone incapable of doing that isn't likely to have anything valuable to say anyway.

I will say that people facing no risks of oppression have the privilege of not having to view certain 'un-PC' talking points as rhetoric used to disenfranchise them but rather as abstract debate positions that don't have any effect over them.";1;1;False;UnfortunatelyLucky;dys2jy7;Farewell from the Pineapple Fund;8ieffr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/

">I'd point to the fact that black people are overrepresented in prisons

Yes, it seams that consumption of marijuana for both races is equal (why just two, I think you have much more in US than just two. How about asians? Jews? Latinos?), however black people overrepresent themselves in other criminal behavior? And I'm not talking about smoking a joint, I'm talking about murder, rape ant theft. And since that is happening, more resources are dedicated to police such problematic communities, where they then get arrested for other misdemeanors, rather than a guy smoking a joint in his bedroom and not causing any fuss. And this is not ""explaining it away"", this is understanding reality, not through the lens of ""how it should be"" or ""how I would like it to be"", but as it is. 

>when charged with the same crime as whites are much more likely to receive harsher sentencing

Actually the harshness of punishment is as follows: white women < black women < white men < black men. So its more of a sexism issue, than racism, and the men get the harsher punishments, racism is secondary here. 

>Aware that the word slave has Slavic origins

So if you are aware, that slavery was a persistent feature of human civilization, and was finally abolished worldwide with the initiative of Great Briton (and we should be singing praises to them for that singular and unparalleled humanitarian achievement of abolishing institutionalized slavery, among other great things that country has provided to our civilization), could you please acknowledge the suffering of other people, instead of singling out African-americans as sole victims of the atrocity of slavery. 

> Eastern European immigrants already face a host of problems

IANAL, but based on what you've said I don't think MIT is the best license for what you're wanting to achieve. It refers specifically to ""Software"" and requires the full license to be distributed alongside the work. So hypothetically I could use these icons in a pamphlet, but I think I'd have to print the entire license on the pamphlet too... that's my interpretation.

Consider going for CC0, which effectively puts the work into the public domain. I think this is really what you're after, based on your language that people can do ""whatever they want"": https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/
