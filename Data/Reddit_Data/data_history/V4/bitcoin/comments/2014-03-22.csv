"This is largely a myth.  

I've had MDMA three times and never experienced this.  Instead, I have experienced (especially in one case) happiness, understanding, empathy, and listening skills that have stayed with me for the years since.

edit: These are two different thoughts.  I wasn't saying that my experience disproves the largely mythological status of impairment-level neurotoxicity from MDMA use.  I was saying that (1) the neurotoxic effects of MDMA, including depression in the days after use, are incredibly overblown almost to the point of mythological status and that (2) I have had experiences which are contrary to this one specific effect.

Although I wish MDMA (and, for that matter, most psychoactives) were studied more, there is already pretty ample research on this matter.

"I didn't mean to suggest that my own anecdote suggested that MDMA neurotoxicity generally (or this effect particular) are mythological.  These are two different thoughts.

The effect described - that MDMA makes a consumer happy at first and ""Then sad again in a few days"" is in fact almost entirely a myth.  It is not a well documented phenomenon.  Quite to the contrary, the best studies have shown and replicated long-term gains against depression, phobias, and PTSD.  MDMA has helped many people lead well-adjusted lives.

It is true that MDMA has been shown fairly conclusively to cause a specific type of toxicity to a specific type of neuron, but this effect can be moderated or, some studies suggest, completely eliminated through the application of specific antioxidants or SSRI's.  The SSRI approach obviously leaves something to be desired because not every serotonin transporter is affected, and those that aren't might suffer even more damage.

In any case, the point is that this blomstertjack's comment reflects a negative stereotype that the available literature suggests is fairly rare - far from the norm.";1;0;False;jMyles;cg99c0o;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.

"There's no doubt that habitual, high-dosage use of MDMA causes a specific type of neurotoxicity - it's not merely ""serotonin or dopamine withdrawal"" but actual oxidative damage to serotonin transporters.  I'm not saying that's a myth.  However, even in this case, the available literature suggests that the effect is both preventable and 100% reversible.

What is a myth (and a cultural stereotype) is that everyone who takes MDMA becomes ""happy"" and then, a few days later, ""becomes sad.""

"From Wikipedia:

>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) is an empathogenic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA has become widely known as ""ecstasy"" (shortened to ""E"", ""X"", or ""XTC""), usually referring to its **street form**, although this term **may also include the presence of possible adulterants**. The UK term ""Mandy"" and the US term ""Molly"" colloquially refer to MDMA that is relatively free of adulterants.[3]

So while you are correct that the term Ecstasy is correlated to MDMA & sometimes used as a synonym, it is worth noting that it causes confusion in many circles to refer to it as such.";1;0;False;ProbablyPostingNaked;cg95bpp;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.

"Yes, but ecstasy became tainted as more and more knock offs and mixtures came out. Bunk pills, other drugs, etc. It also more specifically refers to the pills in the 90s when the term became popular that were usually mdma mixed with amphetamines and caffeine (if you got the good ones). 

After awhile though, other crap got added and people started calling pure MDMA powder/crystal molly.

Which of course, has now been bastardized and you get methylone a lot and other white powders that lookalike.

"Well MDMA is a compound, but when you buy Ecstasy pills, you can get many things. 

For example, if I get a pill that has 80 mg MDMA, 20 mg MDA, and 10 mg ephedrine, did I take MDMA? Yes but I took other things too, and of course I don't actually know what I took unless I get the pill tested, so I think it is easier to just call it 'Ecstasy'.

"Basically. Ecstasy are pills that you buy that when a dealer says ""these are Ecstasy"". You hope they contain MDMA or MDA, but they could contain nothing at all or a mix of things (e.g. caffeine, ephedrine, methamphetamine, ketamine, TMFPP, BZP). 

I guess if the pill contained just meth or caffeine, it wouldn't be 'Ecstasy', it would be 'Fake Ecstasy', but I think a pill that contains 100 mg of MDMA and 20 mg of methamphetamine would still be considered Ecstasy, whereas MDMA is just MDMA, if that makes any sense.
