"> however that is not the ultimate limit of divisibility 
> and more decimal points can be added if there is demand for it.

It pretty much is the ultimate limit of divisibility offered.   There are theoretical ways  the protocol's transaction structures could be re-designed to provide more depth in terms of transactable units per BTC,   but it would be a major project requiring breaking changes to the protocol, and a ""flag day"" as it were, to say the least;   afterwards your protocol is fundamentally different from the Bitcoin protocol definition.

It is not likely,  because you're literally talking about a change in the unit of account for BTC.      Such a change would require a complicated hard fork,    since the result would be  a change to transaction entries that is neither forward nor backwards-compatible,  particularly if the number will change from a 64-bitT to a 128-BitT Value,  and old nodes and clients could no longer even read new blockchain entries.

All the Wallets, Nodes, and Miners,   every piece of software would have to be touched   in  a manner that would also be prone to induce bugs  (thus requiring much testing).

To essentially shift  what a   Satoshi means to a smaller fraction of a BTC,   e.g. to make  1 Sat  1/(10^16)  instead of 1/(10^8) .


So you could say in a theoretical sense  it is possible,  BUT in a practical sense,  it  is probably infeasible,  even if there were significant demand.

You are talking about a completely different thing, which is irrelevant to my point. 

You cannot just increase production by consuming more. You can't eat more apples than you pick. 

You first need to increase productivity. To do that, you need to invest. To invest you need to save. To save you need to lower your temporary consumption.

"> If no one is selling Bitcoin while the demand stays the same, the price will increase dramatically. For the demand to drop, people have to stop wanting Bitcoins. The only way that happens is if you can no longer use them for anything, which is a completely different scenario than if everyone is holding.

Why would everyone be holding in that situation, though? Everyone sane would be scrambling for the exits. You seem to have missed, or at least not properly addressed, an important part of my explanation:

> Just holding doesn't count as a use. Holding alone relies on circular logic: ""Bitcoin is valuable because lots of people are holding it, and lots of people are holding it because it's valuable."" This is virtually the definition of a bubble, easily popped by a fad or a scare.

As for your China example, the problem with using the current situation to try to reason about what would happen in a hodl-only environment is that it's counterfactual. There's too much other demand for Bitcoin, including speculative demand, for a single incident like that to cause a long term problem. It would be different if that other demand didn't exist. And if the only demand is speculative demand, that's a bubble.

You provide the following argument for Bitcoin's intrinsic utility:

> Bitcoin isn't useful because you may one day be able to use it to buy everything on a daily basis. You can already do that with Visa or PayPal. Bitcoin is useful because it can't be stopped, regulated or controlled by any single entity. 

However, the problem with that is that there are other cryptocurrencies with the same properties. If Bitcoin is used for nothing but a store of value, it will soon after be used for nothing at all.

"What? How does spending increase the economy? You can't spend things you don't produce. 

If the economy produces 100 units of a product, you can't spend any more on that. You capital stock, your technology and your labour only allows for 100 units to be produced. 

If you want more than 100 units in the future, you are going to have to invest in capital. To invest in capital, you are going to have to decrease your consumption today to create extra capital. 

The economy doesn't grow by just consuming more. We are already consuming. 

If we want to consume more in the future, i.e. grow, we need to save in the present so that we can invest in said growth. 

""Spending"" isn't really a thing. It's just one part of a transaction. What matters is production, the products we are actually consuming.

You shouldn't. What you would do is figure out your optimal production, which maximizes your profit.

This doesn't make any sense. You are not coherent and you are obviously not following any model. 

The demand is something you face. You can't just ""make more demand"". If people don't value your product, they don't value it. Then it is just waste to produce more of it. 

The only thing you are saying is that you are creating a bad product and you shouldn't be in business in the first place. You shouldn't have customers and you definitely shouldn't be hiring workers.

If you get a loan that means somebody else is saving. Savings is just a way for you to loan yourself. That's an extra step that we don't need in this discussion, but it doesn't change the outcome. 

We can also assume we are already at the optimal L. If not, just increase L until you are at the optimal amount.

">You increase your capital by increasing production

That doesn't make any sense. You can't just ""increase"" production willy nilly. Production is the output. Labour and Capital are the inputs. To get more production, you either need more labour or more capital. 

>When fewer people are spending, of those 100 units 10 go unsold

If 10 are unsold it means that the price is too high. There is overproduction of that particular product. The producer either needs to lower his price or decrease his production, which ever generates more profit for him. 

>so the company has to fire 10 of its 100 workers

Which it should. If there isn't enough demand for the product then spending labour on producing it is a waste. 

>That's how the economy grows, by increasing consumption.

No. That's not how any of this works. 

You can't get more apples by eating more apples. You have to pick them first. Your model isn't coherent and doesn't add up. 

If you are only able to pick 10 apples per day, but you want to increase your consumption to 15 apples per day, you can't just start by eating 15 apples. You don't have them. You can't produce them. 

First you are going to maybe invest in a ladder, so that you are able to climb higher into the trees, so that you can pick 15 apples per day. 

But it takes time and effort to build the ladder. You might need a whole day to make the ladder. But you still need to eat. 

You could lower your consumption to 9 apples per day, and save one apple every day. After 10 days, you have 10 apples lying around that you can eat while you build the ladder. After that, you can increase your consumption to 15 apples per day. 

The problem you are talking about is easily fixed by just lowering prices. That's called deflation. It works. It clears the market. ";1;1;False;vitringur;dq3bwhv;Yeah! Bitcoin!;7dxlap;https://imgur.com/RRU8NXK
">Therefore loans are always more expensive in a deflation compared to a period of inflation

That doesn't make any sense. The real interest rates tells us the real cost of the loan. It doesn't matter what the inflation or deflation is, as long as it is steady and known. 

>People don't want that so they put that money into a bank generating some interest to compensate the inflation.

So you are just forcing people to risk their savings to subsidies loans. Debit accounts usually don't have interests that counter inflation. Banking for this use is irrelevant of inflation. It's more for the convenience and safety. 

I have no idea what you are rambling about marxism and I have no idea why banning people from keeping money in their pillows is a necessary condition for a working and competitive economy. 

We could just as easily say that it reduces competition, i.e. the banks no longer have to compete with the pillowcases. Why shouldn't the banks have to compete with the pillow? If banks can't provide services that the pillow can, isn't that the root of the problem?

>says who?

I just did. Inflation is no incentive to invest. It's an incentive to spend. Investment is incentivized through the real interest rate. Inflation and deflation do not change the real interest rate. 

But my main point is, I have still not seen sufficient theoretical groundwork, nor empirical research, that indicates that a slow and steady deflation is any more damaging than a slow and steady inflation. 

Depressions and recessions are real effects, and their symptoms can often be deflation. That's not necessarily bad. It might even be necessary.

You were just calculating the real interest rate. I know how to calculate the real interest rate. Inflation and deflation doesn't change the real interest rate, only the nominal interest rate. 

The ""cost"" of the loan is determined by the real interest rate, not the nominal one. 

>I'm not sure if you understood the concept of real and nominal

ditto

>I just said that inflation gives an incentive for people to bring their money to banks where it can be reinvested in businesses.

Banning also creates an incentive. The outcome is the same. You are just doing in a politically correct manner. 

""I'm not banning you from importing. I'm just going to tax you to incentivize you to stop importing""

The effect and intent is the same. Controlling people and their money. 

>There is no math behind i know [...] psychological thing.

I am not going to go into behavioural economics or behavioural finances. 

The math however is pretty simple. Your incentive to invest is determined by your time preference and the real interest rate. Inflation does not effect the real interest rate, only the nominal interest rate. 

>there is clearly there is a link between the inflation rate and real interest rate

Again, you are just talking about the nominal interest rate and which portion of that is covering the real interest and which part of it is covering the inflation. The long time equilibrium is the real interest rate, which is not effected by a steady deflation more than it is effected by a steady inflation. 

In any case, you can also index loans, in price changes are going out of control.

i serious don't understand what are you trying to say. 

I provided you the math showing you that deflation adds up to the (real) cost of loans while inflation can be subtracted. The % risk markup that a lender wants covers his effort and the possibility that the borrower will default which is the same regardless of the inflation or deflation rate.

I'm not sure if you understood the concept of real and nominal and deflation and inflation itself.

>banning people from keeping money

I never said anything about banning. I just said that inflation gives an incentive for people to bring their money to banks where it can be reinvested in businesses.

>I just did. Inflation is no incentive to invest. It's an incentive to spend.

debatable. There is no math behind i know that can prove this since its more of a psychological thing.

> Investment is incentivized through the real interest rate. Inflation and deflation do not change the real interest rate.

see top...
i linked you a Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate) saying:

>**If, for example, an investor were able to lock in a 5% interest rate for the coming year and anticipated a 2% rise in prices, they would expect to earn a real interest rate of 3%**.[1] The expected real interest rate is not a single number, as different investors have different expectations of future inflation. Since the inflation rate over the course of a loan is not known initially, volatility in inflation represents a risk to both the lender and the borrower.
In the case of contracts stated in terms of the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate is known only at the end of the period of the loan, based on the realized inflation rate; this is called the ex-post real interest rate. Since the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds, ex-ante real interest rates have become observable.[2]

there is clearly there is a link between the inflation rate and real interest rate

"Because of anonymity, it's difficult to determine the types of transactions that appear on the blockchain, so e.g. distinguishing between a transfer between addresses in the same person's wallet, transfers to/from a Bitcoin exchange, and actual payments for goods and services is impossible in general. With heavy-duty analysis, it's possible to identify well-known addresses and get a somewhat skewed sampling using those as the roots of a graph of known activity.

For overall blockchain statistics, blockchain.info is a good starting point:

https://blockchain.info/stats  
https://blockchain.info/charts

That has charts for things like number of transactions per day, recently ranging from 200k - 300k+. That includes all the types of activity mentioned above. 

One thing to note is that trades on most exchanges generally don't hit the blockchain - the exchange holds the coins, and keeping track of who owns how many coins. So only a small proportion of trading activity shows up in the blockchain - mainly transfers in and out of exchanges.

There are also measures like [Bitcoin Days Destroyed](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/845/what-are-bitcoin-days-destroyed), which attempts to filter out ""churn"" due to e.g. transfers between addresses that aren't actually purchases.

"In economic terms it would be called ""aggregate demand"". 

There are models that deal with such ideas, but you would need way more mathematics to put them forth. 

They are also the types of models I was critizising. 

To get an ""over all"" picture, you first need a small picture. It's rarely clever to jump straight into the deep end. 

This kind of model completely breaks down when describing an individual economy, which is my problem. 

Aggregate demand was an approach popularized by Keynes. Say's law however already tackled the problem of markets not clearing. 

One of the ways to clear a market is to allow for deflation. 

Keynes had to introduce the concepts of ""sticky prices"" and ""sticky wages"" in order of his model of aggregate demand making any sense. 

But in that scenario, the root problem is obviously not the deflation itself. It's the stickiness of wages and prices. In that case, stop worrying about the currency and start fixing the labour market laws. 

But I don't see why the same arguments don't go for deflation as go for inflation. 

I have yet to see a convincing economic theory of why inflation is preferable, or even necessary.

"No hard feelings. 

>I just like to think that the people controlling our currencies know what they're doing and have a good reason to make it inflationary, but maybe that's just wishful thinking

By definition that is wishful thinking, i.e. you admit that you don't know the reasons for the policy and just hope that is was made with the general public in mind. 

The people that control the currency have their own incentives. We can imagine that there is a benevolent government that is just a program designed to maximize human prosperity. We can also imagine a guy that owns a money printing machine. 

The reality is somewhere in between, but I am biased towards thinking about ""people in control"" just like all other people.

A History of Money and Banking in the United States - Murray Rothbard is a great read on the evolution of currency in the USA. It is however based on the Austrian perspective. It's also really long and I don't expect anyone to actually read it (it took me a couple of months on audio book).

Just keep in mind that the people in the 17th and 18th century also had ""reasons"" for import tarriffs that were just ""accepted"". Those who benefit from centrally controlling resources, taxes or the money supply will always have their supporters why their monopoly is acceptable. 

I am generally skeptical towards such approaches. I am definitely not an expert on monetary policy or the policies of central banks. 

However, throughout my education, my personal readings and my visits to multiple central banks, I have not been provided with a sufficient reason for why deflation is such a boogeyman and inflation is praised. 

That attitude however falls perfectly in line with the idea that those who control the money want to create more of it. Basically legal counterfeiting. ";2;0;False;vitringur;dq3l45l;Yeah! Bitcoin!;7dxlap;https://imgur.com/RRU8NXK
"This is a very simplistic view, based on a number of premises that are true today but will not necessarily remain true in the future. BTC is a ""deflationary currency"" only in the sense that today it keeps growing in demand as awareness spreads rapidly. And the only reason people are paid in fiat money is because, as far as the layman knows today, that is the best kind of payment. If the Bitcoin project succeeds, then these two factors will change.";1;1;False;Protossoario;dq2gyt4;Yeah! Bitcoin!;7dxlap;https://imgur.com/RRU8NXK

"Even if this happens, it doesn't matter. This whole thread is an exercise in people missing the point about what Bitcoin is all about.

It's a trust-less and censorship resistant payment network. Just because people may not use it for buying groceries doesn't mean it's worthless. Just like how gold is one of the world's most valuable commodities despite its lack of liquidity (by modern standards), Bitcoin will be valuable as long as the network exists, because there'll never be a time where being able to make an electronic payment without a bank or government interfering stops being useful.";1;1;False;Protossoario;dq2hfiq;Yeah! Bitcoin!;7dxlap;https://imgur.com/RRU8NXK

"That was actually a really flawed and inaccurate explanation. If no one is selling Bitcoin while the demand stays the same, the price will increase dramatically. For the demand to drop, people have to stop wanting Bitcoins. The only way that happens is if you can no longer use them for anything, which is a completely different scenario than if everyone is holding.

The only scenario in which Bitcoin's demand decreases is if it's no longer useful: i.e. if the network becomes centralized such that the system is no longer trust-less.

Consider this: China recently announced what is essentially a ban on Bitcoin exchanges. Did this mean that suddenly Bitcoin's price dropped because Chinese people could no longer buy or sell them? During the first few days, yes, as the market panicked and everyone scrambled to sell. But within two weeks, after panic subsided, demand massively increased because of increased awareness around the globe coupled with supply now being limited in China.

Bitcoin isn't useful because you may one day be able to use it to buy everything on a daily basis. You can already do that with Visa or PayPal. Bitcoin is useful because it can't be stopped, regulated or controlled by any single entity. That's what it means to be trust-less and censorship resistant.

"While technically and theoretically correct, it's likelihood diminishes daily. I believe generalized statements like this are typically used to in mainstream media to keep simpletons out of this sector. 

Advice is only good if it contains value, and to contain value in this case, it should be quantified.

Logically speaking, there's only two outcomes for bitcoin:
1) it's worth plummets to zero
2) it's worth something above zero

If you understand that bitcoin has had about 9 years to plummet to zero and still has not, the likelihood is that it won't ever be worth zero. Remember there were way more volatile periods than as of right now in Bitcoin's history, and if it were to crash to zero, chances are it would have done so already.

You need to remember, that there are plenty of people who would gladly jump at buying bitcoin at 1k per coin, even 5k per coin. These values are considered cheap in the big scheme of things. That's part of the reason, that the chances of ""everyone simultaneously valuing bitcoin at zero"" is so insignificant, it's hardly worth mentioning as a possible scenario.

I'm not saying the current value is correct and that there won't be a pullback in any near future, but if you're not planning on selling any time soon then it's safe to say long term, chances are your investment will go up.

A market order, which is what you do when you purchase on coinbase, costs something like 0.25%.  So it depends on if you're a trader trying to play the game or in for the HODL.

"Dr Jones is clearly clueless about Neo, which he only discovered recently. Ive been following it for a wee bit longer. He's assuming everything in the white paper is correct and implemented. But he clearly hasnt looked at the code yet. Have you?

BTW, dBFT is basically what Ripple uses. The ""improvement"" is that Ripple's UNLs are replaced by bookkeepers that are supposedly elected instead of selected by Ripple. Except of course, that part doesnt work yet, and if you think about the concept for more than 3 seconds, anyone with any knowledge of the subject will see how their voting process can not produce a secure decentralised consensus.  A tiny percentage of voting shares can get you as many bookkeepers as you need to control the blockchain. When I pointed out this glaring flaw in their concept, someone else reported it on their github, and the reply it got from the lead dev was mark the issue as ""to be fixed later"". And Neo pushers pointed out its not really a problem, because Neo can always issue more shares to regain control of the network. Which is actually true. There is nothing in the protocol to prevent the devs from signing in to existence as many Neo tokens as they want. Imagine that. Decentralised ?

"It depends on who you ask. 

A couple of years ago, it was seen as new currency. Today, a lot of people see it as a store of value. 

For bitcoin to be a fully-working currency:
- The price has to even out / less volatility 
- Idiot proof payment and storage systems.

Because its desirable by people, and they believe that others will desire it as well.  There's an expectation that it will be able to be traded for the same, if not more money in the future; its a durable product.
