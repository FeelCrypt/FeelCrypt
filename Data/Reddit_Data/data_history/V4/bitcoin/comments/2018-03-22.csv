"I'm dutch: this describes the result of a court case. The court decided (we don't have a jury system) in January that party A owed party B 0.591 bitcoin because of a contract related to bitcoin mining (between the two parties). This link to a document (from February) describes that:

- This bitcoin that should have been paid after the previous ruling was never paid.
- The bitcoin needs to be paid in bitcoin (as stated in the contract), can not be paid in euros.
- This is not the only party not being paid by the mining company, more victims.
- ""Bitcoin is data stored on a hard disk, it can be send to other parties, it can be proven that bitcoins have been sent from a party to another party"", and thus someone oughta send some bitcoin.
- The court has started a process to enforce the bitcoin from the mining company (using a ""curator"").

I'm not seeing the big news here, they only thing the court said (in my understanding) is that bitcoins are tangible things that can be send, and it can be verified whether they were. It doesn't say anything about bitcoin being money / a currency / a financial asset / etc.

[EDIT]: upon reading it some more, it **DOES** say:

> Hieruit volgt dat een bitcoin een waarde vertegenwoordigt en overdraagbaar is.

Bitcoin is transferable and represents a value.

> Naar het oordeel van de rechtbank vertoont het hiermee kenmerken van een vermogensrecht. [...] Een vordering tot betaling in bitcoin is dus te beschouwen als een vordering die voor verificatie in aanmerking komt.

Because of this (the court has decided that) this means that bitcoin has properties of ""wealth right"" and therefor some laws related to repossession of wealth (""vorderings recht"") apply. Though I am only reading this in relation to the fact that the guy has to pay bitcoin, the wording doesn't specifically call bitcoin anything (just that because of some properties some laws apply).

"But governments treats “things” and “assets” pretty differently. 

Let’s say you write computer code for some analysis at a company, and that analysis is worth something to you and the company you work for.

Then, someone steals your computer, and your computer had the only copy of the code. (Shame on whoever doesn’t back up their code). That code might be worthless to the thief. The worst you can do is sue for damages. At most you would get the value of the computer back. 

It’s deffinitely worthless to the government. If the government takes your computer as “civil forfeiture”, the government can’t do anything with that code. It can’t be considered “seized assets.” It can be considered “evidence”, but the government won’t consider it to have value transferable to dollars, or even equivalent codes. 

Last example. Let’s say you’re in the business of writing computer programs that generate income, and you have a friend doing the same. Let’s say you both want to use each other’s codes. You could buy each other’s codes, and get taxed by the IRS for income from that transaction, or you could just trade codes, and the IRS would not tax that, because computer programs are not “taxable income” ";3;0;False;;dw3udft;Dutch court: Bitcoin is an official financial asset.;869yh1;https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:869

"Even though I'm no lawyer, am Dutch, yet still can't understand this 100%, let me at least clarify some parts so there's sufficient context here:

* The defendant (Koinz Trading B.V.) was previously ordered to pay 0.591 BTC (mining rewards) to the plaintiff. This had to be paid in BTC because this was simply the original agreement.
* The plaintiff in this particular hearing was a lawyer. No other entity was named.
* The subject of the hearing was to declare bankruptcy, requested by the plaintiff. 
* Dutch law states that bankruptcy can be requested either by the owner (defendant in this case) or a creditor. In the case of a creditor, certain proof is required (this is important soon).
* The court originally set a fine (in a previous hearing) up to a maximum of 10,000 euro's if the defendant did not pay the BTC. In the case of a bankruptcy though, fines can't be enforced by court.
* Because the court won't be able to enforce the fine if the request for bankruptcy is granted, the only remaining option is to pay the claim in bitcoins. However, the court can only grant this claim in bitcoins IF it is a verifiable claim.
* The next bit basically explains bitcoins to the court. Important is 1 sentence: ""As such, bitcoins represent value and are transferable."". Due to the wording it isn't inherently clear if this is a case made by the plaintiff or a conclusion from the court. I'm leaning towards option 1 though, because of the sentence following immediately after (next bullet).
* The statement immediately after: ""In the eyes of the court, it seems to carry the hallmarks of a property right. A claim in bitcoins can thus be seem as verifiable."". This effectively means the court can enforce the claim during the bankruptcy proceedings.
* The next part is a long way of saying that plaintiff handed over proof that the defendant hasn't paid anything and that the plaintiff is not alone in this regard (recurring theme). This is enough proof for the court to grant the request to bankruptcy.
* It all pretty much ends in stating a bankruptcy procedure will start.

So TL;DR: 

* Court hearing is regarding a request for bankruptcy (made by plaintiff).
* Debt has to be paid in bitcoins only because this was clearly the value agreed upon previously. In other words, there was no mention of the fiat value this represented at the time, thus no lame cop out. This does NOT mean the court decided that bitcoin is a real currency; the court is simply neutrally stating that this was the value both parties agreed upon. If it didn't involve bitcoins, but pokemon cards to be paid, the court would've made the same decision.
* The case presented to the court lets them conclude that transfer of bitcoins is verifiable. This simply means that the plaintiff can prove the debt was 1) agreed upon and 2) not yet paid. For reference: if the plaintiff said he was owed 10,000 euro's in cash, it would NOT have been a verifiable claim because there's no way to prove the cash was paid or not (different story if it involved a wire transfer obviously).

So while technically positive news in that the court hasn't dismissed the claim because it was bitcoins, it's simply neutral as to what bitcoins actually are. That bitcoins are a verifiable means of exchange shouldn't be news to us, but that alone doesn't equal ""official financial asset"".";3;0;False;BrainNSFW;dw3xn5l;Dutch court: Bitcoin is an official financial asset.;869yh1;https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:869

"> I'm not seeing the big news here

I don't know about the Netherlands, but in the United States only U.S. dollars are legal tender. What that means is that for all debts, no matter the underlying instrument, if a creditor takes a debtor to court, the court can only force the debtor to pay in USD.

It appears that this case is actually quite interesting in the Netherlands as well, since a [prior case](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/netherlands-local-court-ruling-on-bitcoin-transaction/) ruled differently.

>The case involved a never-completed Bitcoin (BTC) transaction carried out in 2012 between two parties. The buyer had sought to purchase BTC2,750 – paying €22,000 (about US$30,000), or about €8 per Bitcoin – from the seller, but only received BTC990. The buyer sued the seller after repeated delays in the delivery of the remaining BTC1,760. (Rizzo, supra.) Ruling in favor of the buyer, **the court ordered the defendant to pay back to the plaintiff the original value of the unpaid amount** (roughly €14,000, about US$19,100 at the time) and also to be responsible for payment of interest and legal costs. The court declined to award the buyer his claim of €130,000 in damages based on lost Bitcoin profits, given that the digital money surged in value last year. (Id.)

>The court stated in the ruling, “Bitcoin is not legal tender [wettig betaalmiddel] and in view of the foregoing it cannot be concluded that Bitcoin can be regarded as ‘current money’ [gangbaar geld] as referred to in article 6:112 BW [Burgerlijk Wetboek, the Civil Code].” (Id.) According to article 112 of the Code, “[m]oney paid to perform an obligation must, at the time of payment, be current in the country in whose currency payment is made.” (Book 6: General Part of the Law of Obligations, THE CIVIL CODE OF THE NETHERLANDS 665 (Wolters Kluwer 2009).) The definition of legal tender in the Netherlands, according to the court, “is limited to euros and other coins issued by the European Central Bank (ECB).” (Rizzo, supra; Case No. C/08/140456, citing to arts. 10 & 11 of Regulation 974/98 of the European Community.)";4;3;False;chrisrico;dw3vkjs;Dutch court: Bitcoin is an official financial asset.;869yh1;https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:869

"I don't know man, I reckon that's pretty well spot-on.

> Let's take a real-world example: Another GFC hits. Equity (or future equivalent) Markets tank.

> Instead of waiting for a bunch of suits to decrease the interbank cash rate to ""stimulate"" their national economy, and then waiting for institutional investors all over the world to get their shit together; and then waiting for all that to trickle down the the real world where people start spending again; INSTEAD Bitcoin skyrockets in value as people flock to a safe haven.

> Now all the average mum's and dad's out there have drastically increased their marginal propensity to consume (the value of their bitcoin savings has increased by 20%) - this AUTOMATICALLY stimulates the economy within hours. Sure, investors searching for high returns have been hurt badly, but that's the RISK they took. They are the ones that should lose relative purchasing power. Not the average person who has nothing to do with toxic assets and just wants to know they can retire comfortably without the headache of their 401k (superannuation) halving or their bank not giving them their savings back. 

I'd like to see how that assumption could be wrong.  I can't see it.  It is the way to punish the unsuccessful risk-takers, but also reward the successful ones.  All the risk right now is passed onto the savers, and their savings are hit when these risks blow-up.  This solves that problem.

This is a [1:10000 rule](https://xkcd.com/1053/) argument for me.  I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset.  The difference between investment and usury?  In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.

I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments. 

That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  It is pure genius.";4;2;False;Frogolocalypse;dw2y8en;"""Bitcoin will be the single global currency of the internet,"" says founder of Twitter & Square";8617n5;https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/976315822397444098
You're off your rocker if that is the conclusion you draw. I agree in theory that not spending money stunts the economy but having a mutable and arbitrary interest rate only serves the purpose of making it harder for the masses to save and invest capital.

Yes, it does matter that another private entity unseated the prior, because the point you (and they) are trying to make is that FOSS/open standards are more resilient.

The evidence cited does not support the point raised. It's perfectly normal and expected that private entities will come and go with time. Corporate entities failing does not mean FOSS or open standards are better, especially considering that I can name a LOT of failed FOSS projects and open standards that never saw adoption.

"HTTP started out as nothing more than NNTP with a smaller and faster cache.  What do you think get/post means?  Instead of acquiring content from an NNTP server, which has a secondary function of replicating between other NNTP servers, you connect to a HTTP server, and like NNTP, replicate the sought content locally, and then you read that content from your local cache. 

PS+EDIT : If ya wanna be pedantic about it, SMTP and NNTP are both extended from the same technology.  Indeed, it was that distributed store of research information which included email and discussion topics, developed as a safeguard against nuclear attack.  Hence, why it was created.

"Pretty sure we covered that in ECON, yep, we did, and I do remember what inflation is. . .  

Bitcoin fees are so high that they (read the words) ACT LIKE hyper-inflation.  

Is that better, or easier to understand?  Do you disagree that the high transaction fees of using BTC make the total amount you get or send lower? 

maybe I am not saying this clearly.  Isn't that similar to the effect of inflation on a currency-you must give more to get the same thing after high inflation.

"How can this possibly be true?

If Bitcoin goes up and down like crazy, then why would anyone hold it for any period of time...? You risk losing loads of money if the price goes down, for example, dropping recently from $20,000 to as low as $7,000 or so. 

Even if Bitcoin ever rises to $20,000 again... how long will this take...? It's already been months... So what happens if you need to pay bills in this time... while you are waiting for it to hit $20,000 again...? Will your landlord or loan company or mortgage company just let you off the hook..? Because they think the price may rise to $20,000 again, so they'll just take your Bitcoins, and not worry about the dollar losses...?

How completely and utterly **ridiculous**.

It could only ever be used in between the dollar, in which case, you are going through Visa/Mastercard/your Bitcoin exchange/the banking system in order to even convert your dollars to and from Bitcoin.

There is simply no way Bitcoin can ever overtake the dollar, unless close to 100% of all dollars were converted into Bitcoins.

And if you think that is going to happen... you are utterly INSANE.";0;0;False;foooood4thought;dw30zy0;"""Bitcoin will be the single global currency of the internet,"" says founder of Twitter & Square";8617n5;https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/976315822397444098

"I've been pondering this predicament for a while now. The world is in a very different place now than in the 1940's when Keynes threw out the classical economic model of Adam Smith (yes, economics can, does and will change - that's why it's theory, not fact).

We are globalized. If China goes down, so does the US. If the US tanks, so do the EU. Keynes taught us that during an economic downturn, central banks and governments should stimulate the economy. Well, in the last GFC, the second largest economy was growing at 6% - 8%. The UK, EU and IMF implemented austerity, and the US had nowhere to go with interest rates and spent all its money on bailing out the big banks. So, it's not as simple as high school economics at the moment. But it could be! Enter BITCOIN.

Fastward 10 years. Bitcoin is so big that it has very little volatility (can't be manipulated). If people are scared to invest (global economic downturn), they will keep their money in Bitcoin. Expecting a 1 - 5% increase p.a. because others agree with them that it's probably a bad time to take on risk, and instead want to keep safe in (low volatility, deflationary) Bitcoin.

If people believe it's the right time to invest, they will take their money out of Bitcoin and invest it (expecting a higher return) in assets (or ecosystems) that have productive value. Bitcoin should now start to decrease by about 1% a year - in turn encouraging more people to take money out of Bitcoin and invest in assets with productive value instead (Ethereum, NEO, Cardano, IOTA, various tokens). 

Keynesian economics relies heavily on ""automatic stabilizers"". These automatic stabilizers will remain in effect - whether it's Central Banks deciding the risk-free rate of return or the ""herd mentality"". The ""herd"" will probably make the stabilizers work more efficiently. The work of Adam Smith reminds us that as each individual acts in their own self-interest (wanting to profit when the chance presents itself), they will collectively create the market that should exist. This was only possible in theory - until humanity stumbled upon decentralization. 

Let's take a real-world example: Another GFC hits. Equity (or future equivalent) Markets tank. 

Instead of waiting for a bunch of suits to decrease the interbank cash rate to ""stimulate"" their national economy, and then waiting for institutional investors all over the world to get their shit together; and then waiting for all that to trickle down the the real world where people start spending again; INSTEAD Bitcoin skyrockets in value as people flock to a safe haven. 

Now all the average mum's and dad's out there have drastically increased their marginal propensity to consume (the value of their bitcoin savings has increased by 20%) - this AUTOMATICALLY stimulates the economy within hours. Sure, investors searching for high returns have been hurt badly, but that's the RISK they took. They are the ones that should lose relative purchasing power. Not the average person who has nothing to do with toxic assets and just wants to know they can retire comfortably without the headache of their 401k (superannuation) halving or their bank not giving them their savings back. 

On the flip side? Inflation is getting out of hand?  How though? Bitcoin's supply is fixed. The price of goods and services should directly reflect the comparative advantage of that country, state, and county. 

For example, the price of bread in NYC goes from average 5 Satoshi to 8 Satoshi over 2 years. But the price of bread in Sydney stays at 5 Satoshi. Well, the citizens of NYC are being paid more Bitcoin on average because there is still demand for bread at 8 Satoshis, their economy is growing. If they travel to Australia, they will have a higher purchasing power (they be thinking, ""wow I can buy 1 1/2 bread here for the same price of 1 bread at home"") - exactly like they do now with fiat currency (thankfully with bitcoin, it will be without the exchange rate headache). 

What if the cost of bread went to 20sats in NYC? Well, you must be fucking loaded if you want to live in NYC. If you leave NYC, you are going to feel like a king. If after 1 year, no one is buying the 20 sat bread because they are importing 3 sat bread from Wyoming, then the guy charging 20 sats needs to get his shit together. 

I could ramble on, but this has taken way longer than I hoped. haha.. Point is - global economics is full of contradictions and fallacies, I think It's worth thinking about the counterfactual and how Bitcoin could help for the better. 

Last point though - Just because there are no US dollars does not mean that the US can't still tax its citizens and borrow bitcoin through bonds. It just means that any government wanting to do so will need to EARN the right and that means convincing their citizens that it's in their best interest - Which could work quite well for the average citizen. It will be a lot harder for any individual country to manipulate the economy, however, they should have only been doing that to influence savings vs consumption - thankfully bitcoin should do that automatically for them instead. 

Side Note: The blockchain future I'm imagining doesn't want Bitcoin for daily transactions. Don't get me wrong - I do think Bitcoin will be the largest cap coin. It's deflationary and will be the most widely trusted on the planet. I would buy a house or business or car with it. But people will always be exchanging small portions of Bitcoin for litecoin, bcash, monero, or verge when the exchange rate is good (and depending on their geographic location/lifestyle). This will be their weekly discretionary spending budget. 

If you have any specific thoughts, please let me know as I enjoying trying to figure out this mess.

"Full Tilt usually invests pre-Series A (but has invested at other times), so very very early in a companies inception. Obviously, at that stage they are investing more in people than the company per se.

Pomp himself has started a few smaller tech companies, but then ending up working on growth teams during Facebook's rise. He then did some small scale consulting and then managed to use his connections to create this fund. The first fund was geared more towards tech (apps/mobile) companies, where he could use his skills learned at Facebook to inject large growth and immediately see 10x on his investments. 

Now he is focusing on crypto/blockchain as he sees this is where the future will head in 10+ years. 

He actually also has a [Mining Company](https://blog.usejournal.com/introducing-standard-american-mining-2e789f99785e) that is using a tech he invested in in his first fund. It recycles tires and uses the energy generated from it to mitigate the energy costs that are associated with mining. 

He's a very good speaker that sees the big picture. Then identifies who is necessary to surround himself with to achieve those goals. 

I'd definitely follow him on twitter. He's rah rah but he also has gold nuggets of info, especially on the podcasts he's featured in.
