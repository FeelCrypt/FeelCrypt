Sorry but you are wrong. Value doesn’t just derive magically from scarcity.  There are many components to the driver of value.  Supply and demand not just supply etc.  Volatility drives capital flows specially when something must retain purchasing power.  For example, the dollar (usd)or most currencies hold value because most of its transactions are from businesses doing business with it.  The amount of speculative holding or short selling of the currencies in forex is tiny, a very very small %.  The opposite is true for cryptos, a huge portion is speculative churning in the exchange and a tiny portion is people using it for business.  Then theres the fact that new cryptos can just continue to be made which dilutes the value of the rest.;1;0;False;FuriouslyKindHermes;f1f59q3;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
