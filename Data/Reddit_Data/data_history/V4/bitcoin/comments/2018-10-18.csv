"Well, you're making a distinction that was not in evidence in this month long thread. And, FITW there are plenty of people who identify as ""democratic socialist"" who do align themselves with Che and Marx. This is not a genuine observation unless we throw out the entire history of secular economic systems and start with a seperate definition that TMK has an undetermined level of consensus.

Most countries aren't 100% capitalist or 100% socialist -- both labels can be applied to the *same* country depending on the specific policies, programs, or laws that you're talking about.;1;1;False;mmortal03;e7ztvlb;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding of how Bitcoin works, the more money is moving around, the more money is sent to miners in exchange for verifying all those transactions, yes? And if there's more money going to miners, then mining becomes more attractive. More people get into mining, existing mining operations get bigger, and more power is drawn.;1;0;False;AgentPaper0;e7z3akr;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png
The hashes solved give the ledger its properties, so the energy is not wasted.
