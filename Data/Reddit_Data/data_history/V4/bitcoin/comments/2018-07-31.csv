"> Do you personally trust USD?

Somewhat. I am still hesitant as to what I think of the USD and I do believe it can be done better and that there are a few things that need to be addressed, however, it is literally the center of global economics. If it is to fall, so is the global economy.

> we all know it's being created like there's no tomorrow

Its created and follows controlled inflation which really isn't that scary and makes sense. Its created out of nothing which a lot of people assume means that the federal reserve just creates it whenever they want. Its a lot more complicated than that.

> and we all know all fiat currencies sooner or later disappear in a fire of hyperinflation

Eh, not necessarily. Economics is a lot more complex than that. There is a lot of factors that play into hyperinflation.

> As for the OP, I think it is a playful discussion of the idea ""Huh, maybe currencies backed by something have an advantage over those not backed by anything?""

Yes, which is exactly what the Keynesian school of economics points out to be wrong and an economic thought fallacy. We discovered awhile ago that it would be a much smarter idea to take silver/gold out of our currencies. It allows fiat currency to be manipulated accordingly, allowing us to more easily create controlled inflation. It is backed by trust and demand which are a lot stronger and more important than you think.

> I'm very aware that crypto is not backed by anything btw.

You seem to again be confused with what debt is. I find it crazy that the majority of our population still believes the debt problem is real. Politicians use this to their advantage when making economic policies and can make economic policies that look good to the public but are horrible for the economy.

"I understand that gold has desirable properties. It has value as a ""good"".  I'm saying that using it as currency turns it into something speculative. It has more value than what it's usefulness gives it. Paper also has value, albeit a very small value. Turning it into currency then gives it a higher value. It's the same with gold. Gold just has a higher base material value due to its use cases. The current price of gold is not based on its uses but more on it being an appreciating asset. To put it another way people dont invest in gold so they can use it to make something someday, they invest to hopefully turn a profit. It's value is because people are assigning it value same as with fiat. 

Also I never said all value is arbitrary. Value comes from use. The only things with real value are goods and services. Everything else is an abstraction to make commerce easier.

I feel like we aren't on the same page here. I'm not saying gold is a bad investment, I'm not saying it will become worthless. I'm simply pointing out that it's value as a currency is arbitrary and not inherent just like fiat. That's my only point.

> [emission of fiat] Its a lot more complicated than that.

The good thing is that I personally can abstract all of this complexity away when deciding how to hold my savings. Is someone for whatever reason arbitrarily creating this thing that I work hard to accumulate? I think I'm going to get rid of it in favor of something else.

> [fiat dies] Eh, not necessarily.

Not necessarily in the future, but certainly true so far. I see no reason for this trend to end. I believe average lifespan of fiat is around 27 years, but that is tricky due to many currencies not starting as fiat and only becoming fiat at some point later in their existence. So yes, empirically and logically speaking all fiat dies, it is upon us to be smart and to be ready.

> We discovered awhile ago that it would be a much smarter idea to take silver/gold out of our currencies.

Whoa. I'm unaware of such discoveries. I'm quite certain (but open to evidence to the contrary) that it is always the state that can't support welfare/war or both removes the gold standard to go on a spending binge. There's no ""we discovered"", it's just a failing state briefly prolonging it's (usually evil) existence by robbing the savers and the gullible.

> It is backed by trust

Again, I don't think anyone with any degree of economic knowledge can ""trust"" fiat (this is not intended to sound like a jab at you or anyone). It's being printed, holding it long term is not economically viable if you have other options.

> It is backed by trust and demand

Aha, demand is interesting indeed. I'd say there's a huge demand for money, money is incredibly useful tool. The question is - why do people use fiat and not some non-inflationary currency? What do you think?

Let's take this to the other extreme. One gold ounce coin bought a decent suit at a high-end retailer in 1917. One gold ounce coin buys a decent suit at a high-end retailer in 2018. It's called the Gold-to-Decent-Suit Ratio and it's been around a while.

Nothing, except the belief that in the future it will be readily accepted by almost everyone as an acceptable form of payment and it’s scarce (hence the investment opportunities). It’s the naivety that some have that crypto is oh so superior and anyone using fiat is an idiot.

When gold was available to be mined and procured by a nation state inflation could potentially be managed. However inflation and deflation was a problem that often plagued early America. A gold back currency wasn’t with major problems let alone in a modern era. wasn’t a catch all.  It required a massive amount of time donated to the acquisition, production and distribution of gold bars and bullion.

Do you personally trust USD? What properties do you think it will hold and for what time?

"**Its the view the post has on economics** (which to be fair, economics is not taught well or at all to the general population).

Here are the main points that I think need to be addressed.

> but since our money has no value anymore, since it was taken off the gold standard,

**This thought process is actually kinda common but the poster treats it as if it is fact and makes the assumption that fiat currency has no value.** While it is true that gold and silver standards were part of our currency for a long time, saying that because we are without it, our money is worthless is naive. The fact that there is trust in the USD and that it is a resource that is in high demand by the public makes it have value. A lot of people put this down to the Keynesian vs. Austrian school of economics but the Keynesian school of economics is what almost every country follows (excluding Cuba and North Korea) and is how money is based off of. The Federal Reserve is what basically runs the show and is what has the most direct control over the economy.

> whereas these coins are backed by Big Macs, does that make them a more stable currency than our own money

I personally have not read too much on how this coin works and do not know if the amount of coins is tied to the USD or if its independent of the USD so I cannot speak on that part. However, I can certainly speak on the second part.

First of all, what is more likely to happen? That McDonald's as a business closes down or that the US has an economic collapse (which also, the US is very important to the global economy as shown by the USD backing almost all currencies so we could potentially say a global economic collapse). If the USD was to fall, almost all currencies would fall with it given that the federal reserve backs almost all global currencies with USD (which some countries have not been fond of and have been trying to move away from). Also, this really isn't a currency with high demand. This is only used for Big Macs. It is literally backed by Big Macs (and again, I am not sure how true this statement is as I have yet to look closely into the coin). There is very little trust in this currency as opposed to the USD which literally runs the global economy. The USD is also pretty stable as far as stability goes due to controlled inflation. This coin still is going to be tied back indirectly to fiat currencies.";8;1;False;;e3bfqj7;So they agree that fiat currency has no value anymore.;933bnu;https://i.redd.it/ozij0ypxn2d11.jpg

Clearly, fiat can die.  Just look at any country where hyper-inflation has occured.

Seriously, I'm not trying to troll anyone here.  I'm interested in hearing someone's argument as to why crypto (which requires computers and an internet connection) would become the currency of a county where transactions occur at farmer's produce stands, at street side hot dog vendor's carts, etc.  I'm going to a bitcoin meet-up tomorrow night and I would like to tap the wisdom of the members of this forum.

Bitcoin is a good form of money for many reasons including being fast & cheap to transfer, has a limited max supply, can be sent quickly sent locally or worldwide, and does not rely on a central authority such as a bank or government. As long as the person running the farmer's produce stand or hot dog cart has a cell phone with internet connection, they can immediately start receiving payments.
