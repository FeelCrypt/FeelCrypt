">Not really. It's more of an electricity grid equalizer. Wherever there is a surplus of electricity mining can be profitable which lets power companies build up capacity before there is actual use for it.

A surplus usually exists as a buffer; if there is too much electricity, you turn down power plants. There is already dynamic production, to a degree.

It's a bit nonsensical to argue it as a plus that power companies can build up capacities that wouldn't even be necesary without Bitcoin. I'd bet the cost is why most of the mining happens in china. Cheap, dirty energy for maximum profitability.  
Boosting the economy short term with little regard for environment is the problem China and the world have in the first place, yet the guy in the video wants to sell it as an advantage.

"Think about this for just a second.

Banks have 'rows and rows' of servers. But what process do banks actually need to complete to complete a batch of transactions?

Receive a few requests, verify the requests, send the transaction batch to a processor, or multiple transactions to multiple processors. Balance against the incoming/outgoings at end of day.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, has to solve multiple increasingly difficult maths problems via brute force. Every attempt that isn't successful is wasted energy. And by design, there has to be an overwhelming majority that are unsuccessful as otherwise manipulation can occur.

The energy cost of completing that puzzle increase with usage and price. The number of unsuccessful attempts is likely to increase as well.

The amount of wasted power, if Bitcoin was actually doing anywhere close to the number of transactions that banks were doing, would be unimaginable.

The 'rows and rows' of Bitcoin already exist, with 0.000000000000001% the transaction volume. The individual computers are just distributed.";1;0;False;cashiousconvertious;duxgy0b;I work at a major electronics store. It's been like this nearly a month.;80i9p9;https://i.redd.it/fhq6vel6nni01.jpg

"Most of the developing world has massive issues with power supply causing a major halt on economic development.

Chicken and egg problem. Can't have factories due to lack of power, can't build powerplants due to lack of consumers. Bitcoin mining is very quick to start up and to balance against existing power supply.

"So you don't realize that runaway pollution isn't a thing in a self-limited system.

We have many systems on our planet that keeps on growing in energy usage all the time but bitcoin is not one of them. The halvenings will keep it down as well.

It's not like the fiat banking system is run on air either. The whole thing is a cost-benefit analysis and in the long run bitcoin is likely better for the environment than many other forms of currencies. It isn't like bitcoin mining is wasting energy, really. They are converting energy to securing a financial system. And the amount of energy is almost never more than blockrewards x blocks per day in fiat currency that pays for electricity.

That the developing world is entering the ""everyone has a car and eats meat every day"" phase is worse in every conceivable way.

In short: 

1. To reduce pollution we need effective powerplants. 
1. Effective powerplants are large powerplants. 
1. No one builds large powerplants if there isn't a need. 
1. Mining can drive the need. 
1. Once there is adequate power supplies society can adopt away from dirty power. 
1. Power costs goes up. 
1. Miners move to the next underdeveloped power area.

The environment does absolutely run off a balance sheet. Currently our carbon footprint is deep in the red. Bitcoin mining likely does fuck all to that number, in some scenarios it even improves them as large powerplants needs a steady rate of consumption to stay effective.";4;0;False;Pretagonist;duwctkk;I work at a major electronics store.

"It's interesting to follow. I'm not really looking for one either even though my current one is old trash (Radeon 5770).

The graphics card manufacturers and the retailers don't really want to be selling to the miners if they can help it, because they know those GPUs will end up on the used market and the miners aren't buying other components (what the retailers want) and might suddenly stop buying GPUs altogether (manufacturers don't want that). So they've been trying to save stock for gamers somehow but it's not always successful. Motherboard + GPU combos have been common, but those still have to be heavily marked up otherwise miners will just buy them up and sell the motherboards. 1-per-customer rules have been almost completely bypassed. Gamers are turning to prebuilts as the economical option (with some people speculating that it might be possible to buy them to resell the GPU and the rest of the system separately for a profit).

My idea is that a trade-in program would work best. If you give back your old GPU you get a big discount on the new card. It directly cuts some cards out of the used market and would be generally prohibitive for miners to exploit (and even if miners did go around Craigslist buying cards to trade in, they're still culling the used market so it still worked).";2;0;False;ICantSeeIt;dux09rf;I work at a major electronics store.

"It's not a straight forward thing and not every case is the same. In some cases price is a better mediator, in other cases time is better. If you have a fixed price you end up with dickish behaviour too, nepotism, cheating, stealing etc. 
  
For instance, in my local community we have a ticketed event, the tickets sell quickly, sometimes instantly, but we prefer time to be the mediator because we want the event to be accessible for people on low incomes. In your ticket reseller case organizers should put work in to stop the reselling behaviour.     
 
High end GPU's on the other hand are better mediated by price, because some people may really need the resource for something, (as in would pay thousands) but can't compete with a teenager queueing at a shop for hours. It also sends pricing signals to the manufacturer (and competitors) to say additional capacity is needed. Also people with spare GPU's will sell them second hand. Some might even be saved from going to the dump. Price is better in this case, otherwise you end up with Nepotism being the winning factor.  
  
What really sucks now is that, Nvidia know they have excess demand, but they are not going to produce more GPU's because it poses an existential business risk for them. (they are worried alt coin market might die out next year). So we are a little stuck with this situation.

I’m not gonna argue the ethics of it, but I would say the society we live in entitles anyone to profit as a reseller. By law, it is allowed. We live in a capitalist society where people are incentivized to screw others over for profit. Almost everything you buy could be bought for less, but someone is screwing you over to make a buck.  You just accept it in the context of retail. If something is being sold below market value, there is a huge incentive for someone to step in and take that profit.

One could argue that maybe one mechanism may be more prone to discrimination in what transactions are included, but I think neither is sufficiently centralized to allow something like that.

Furthermore I think POW is a lot more centralized. With POW the amount of money expended for mining should be just below the block rewards plus fees. So if you want to do a 51% attack you would have to spend at most that amount. Probably a lot less, as other miners would stop mining if you make put enough mining power in to make mining unprofitable. With POS you need 51% of the active market cap.

In practice as well: POW is not very decentralized with most mining being done in large scale farms.

I have posted this many times in pcmasterrace, it isn't miners. The issue is Nvidia and AMD have realized they can artificially limiting supply and make a whole lot more in profits. You see GPU makers would have already be cutting prices to keep people buying instead of holding out for the next generation. Currently people are posting deals as $100 over MSRP and excited to jump on them. They act like an MSRP card is winning the lotto. Nvidia is most likely even going to delay the 11 series, we know they aren't worried about Vega and AMD is able to sell and be competitive with nvidias supply method they love it too.

"The main GPU chip (the hard part) costs ~$1-$2 Billion just to design, based on Nvidia's numbers (I may be estimating on the low end). It would be more expensive than that for a new company because Nvidia/AMD is leveraging their experience designing GPUs and have a lot of design patents.

After you design it you need to get it built, so you need a semiconductor fab. That gets tricky since there's pretty much only Intel (can't use their fabs), TSMC (pretty much at capacity), GloFo (either at capacity or broken all the time), and Samsung (not for GPUs). So the only real option for an outside company is to pay extra for another company's time on TSMC's process, spending hundreds of millions more.

Next you need to either convince the companies that put AMD and Nvidia's GPU chips onto actual graphics cards to buy your new chips and create new PCB designs for them, or else you need to design, manufacture, and sell your own completed boards (yet another factory).

Meanwhile, you need a team of programmers writing drivers for your card to make it work with every computer program ever written.

Basically, it's completely impossible, and it'd be a risky bet even if it was possible. It's a tough market full of anticompetitive tactics from Nvidia, so even AMD has a tough time. Intel just started a project to build their own dedicated GPUs, and it's not expected to be done for up to 5 years.

"There are a large number of different mining algorithms. Where previously it was mostly an AMD-dominated world, mining is now interesting for pretty much anyone. With profits still considerably higher than costs in almost all cases, miners can afford to get a GPU that's not at the exact best price/performance spot.

Add to that the fact that there are still regular gamers buying these cards.

It would be nice to have dedicated mining cards because obviously one doesn't need 3x HDMI's 1 optical out 2 DVI's when mining, and I'm sure there could be other optimizations so that the gaming GPU's are less attractive to miners.

"Probably cause the miners took all the good cards, and the gamers are taking the left over scraps. Especially those who are needing to replace a broken card and have no choice but to take whatever they can get their hands on to get their PC working again.

In the end the gamers eventually will be able to get their hands on the current good cards when Nvidia comes out with the next model. All of today's good cards will be put on ebay since the miners will have to snatch all the new cards to keep profitable. It's going to be a never ending cycle till someone comes out with an ASIC that makes using GPUs unprofitable period. Or nvidia does something to cripple their GPUs so they can't be used for mining but still work for games. Even if they did that i'm sure people will find a way around it. If they do it in hardware that will probably cripple games as well and if they put some kind of detection routine in the drivers to detect that the card is being used for, people will find a way around that as well or just keep using older drivers.

"Yes, you're right. Most of programmers don't deal with math on a daily basis. But at the same time most of programmers do not do anything advanced. Frankly speaking most of programmers are just code monkeys and nothing more. But I supposed we're talking not about code monkeys. Math is essential for crypto, even just to understand why it works and is viable. Data structures, statistics, hash functions, cryptohash functions, digital signatures, Merkle trees, Merkle-Damgard transformations, data bases, data integrity, how to organize your ledger, how to organize security... it is all math or math-related. Doubt that any 6-month-self-practiced kid would be ever able to invent something like this. God bless him if he would even get basic knowledge and understanding. 

I do not deny that this is possible to learn all this stuff yourself, but you need to learn. Otherwise you would produce low-quality software (if any at all) prone to bugs, attacks and imminent failures. While it can be fun for you it is absolutely irresponsible in regard to your users and their safety especially if you're dealing with money.

"I think this applies to many fields. The problem is that many graduates leave university and think that they will be given decent jobs. When, in reality, they DO get decent jobs BUT their learning has only just begun. A degree prepares you for a life of learning - and if you don't make the effort to learn, you will not progress as well as you'd hoped. If you don't like learning or struggle with academia, then a degree is probably wasted to some extent on you. You have been employed on your ability to learn - and your employer wants you to learn something new, usually.

Don't get me wrong, but learning or academia is extremely hard - it's no walk in the park, getting a degree.

"Yes, but I have a wife and young child which makes it more complicated than if I were single.

It's been an ongoing discussion with my wife, and we are considering a move. The main challenge becomes how to make it all work between cash on hand to afford a move, housing, as well as finding the right company and position. The possibility of moving, getting stuck in a similar support role makes me cringe. What a nightmare it would be! 

Not having any developer experience wouldn't make me a prime candidate for a role I want. Would I have to settle for some helpdesk or desktop support role in hopes that, eventually, I'll hopefully find a more desirable position? I hate to admit that's very likely, which doesn't excite me.

I've been working helpdesk jobs since a completed my first degree, an AAS in network infrastructure. My current position I've been at for over 6 years. During that time I completed a Bachelors degree in CS software development as well as acquiring multiple certifications including Oracle Java se7 programmer.

The unfortunate reality is at my current job no one values or cares about any of that, and there's no room to advance into a more senior role.  I'm the most technically educated resource in our department, yet I'm the low man on the totem pole. The only thing that matters is seniority.

So, you're right: moving is really the only option. With it comes a whole nother set of uncertainties. FML, it's discouraging.

"I am pretty sure this turned out to not be the case. Actually women are capable of studying STEM fields, but they are simply not interested in STEM fields. Recently I was watching a lot of videos on this topic and there was this one Swedish study which surprised me: They were showing objects to a new born children (with no previous social interactions, so data are not skewed by parenting). One object was linked to ""systems"" (some mechanical toy) and the other was a face (""social"" side). Majority of males spent most of the time showing interest in the toy, while majority of females preferred watching the face. It all makes sense from evolutionary perspective - females take (took) care about children, so evolution made them in a way, so they are more interested in the social side. They linked this behaviour to testosterone levels before and after birth. There are definitely good women in IT, but pushing by force more women will only lead to lowering requirements (see Google fiasco with Damore's memo) and thus getting less qualified (=less interested in tech) women which will make it harder for those ""real"" IT women. It's really sad that by wanting more women in tech, result probably will be less women or all women being less paid in tech or men leaving the company, leading to eventual end of company because of lack of good (qualified) employees.";4;2;False;monnef;dux6uag;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

Nothing can break you unless you want. So if something breaks you, then you wanted it. If you (or I) wanted something self-destructive, then there is the understanding why you or I wanted it.

I don't think we disagree on much. My main point is that a *formal* education is not necessary to be a great software engineer. I also think that apprenticeships offer a better way for the inexperienced to grow into a career in CS. It would also give employers an excuse to bring in entry-level employees at an even lower rate. Most entry-level positions have at least *some* expectations such as a degree or some experience. I'm talking about an even more entry-level position where you get a shot at showing that you have the ability and drive to become a valuable contributor *eventually*. I see it as a win-win for both potential employees and employers. Employers get low level employees willing to work for very low pay and do some of the shit work that experienced people would rather not do, and inexperienced employees get to avoid spending years and thousands of dollars on formal education, and instead get to earn a little money while getting started on their (hopefully) careers.;2;1;False;rredline;dux53rz;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"I can feel you, I have the same repeated experience.

However: there are surprises in the world and bigger than the btc price hikes. One of them is that not all women are like that. You just have to play hard on all levels. There really exist the few brave women that fight for their place and their ego has no problem with the fact that men are simply better in certain areas.

So all the bullshit around is maybe just a test. Test for both men and women to get out of it. Both sexes looking for comfortable life that will be approved by society are failing. There are no winners. There is no winning or better story that we should listen. The recent ""female stories"" will not get better if they are replaced by macho stories.

In other words: I do not pity the men who are broken by bitches. It is their fault that they were not questioning upfront what the society was serving to them. It is all ok! Let those stupid stories how woman can be equal programmers prevail, even when it is obvious that it is impossible (I am project manager of my own business and while it is hard to work with male-devs, it is impossible with woman-devs). It is just the test for those who are willing to see the obvious truth.

You are not helping anyone with the approach that after they will be old or older and see the truth, they can go back and get the feet on the ground seeing that others see it too. What you are doing is just repeating what the women do. Strong people can live alone and fight alone.

"Let's be a bit more conservative about this. While there is plenty of Windows based competition there is a corresponding amount of jobs.

This argument works well for development as it's a more mixed grab field. But if you're wanting into systems/security you really should have a multi-platform background. There are benefits to both platforms and as an IT professional you need to know them. For example Linux is top tier for web, HPC, etc. But Windows has little competition for core infrastructure, business desktop, and internal facing services.

If your goal is medium/large enterprises you should focus on Windows first. Otherwise start in Linux. Honestly as time goes on applications and development is becoming less platform-centric. Similarly system resource consumption becomes less concerning and pronounced. If these trends continues it will come down to which platform can be supported easily and affordably.

I'm not saying one is better than the other. Just research your preferred industry :).

"The dynamics we have are basically due to closed source software environments. It’s a boys club. Look at all the ICO’s and shitcoins as that example. SiliCON Valley has taken this as a call for them to take the lead. And everyone is paying the price. It’s a very high price for software that can be done at a fraction of the cost to investors. It’s a pump and dump. 

As for women in tech. I know quite a few. Many are focused on what we have today and not what we can have tomorrow. Even with encouragement or funding it persist. There is nothing wrong with that either. It’s their choice. That’s where the articles about this topic fail on all fronts. Women have a choice. But just paint the picture as tech has no women and it leaves out choice. Apparently journalist miss this point for a reason. And it rallies other women who aren’t in tech to say there is discrimination. Maybe in a concentrated culture like SiliCon Valley there is. So maybe if women want they can move to other locales and make an effort. Really the money will follow. 

But this conversation will never end till we just look at what it really is about. The reward. There is an incentive for each person to achieve the riches in tech. And we let a few barons decide the standards. Then outsiders like journalist come in and keeps the tone about a battle of sexes. It’s not. It’s about the tech. It’s always about the tech.

"Can confirm.

I work in a .NET shop, but not writing .NET code. I don't envy any of them, and I watch them struggle with limitations in MS software and dev tools that similar open source software solved years ago.

I mean Visual Studio alone is a huge source of headaches for them, and for some reason is missing features that VS Code has. Why does the free code editor include features that are paid on a giant enterprise IDE? (money, obviously, but that's not my point) And every .NET dev here has had to apply *manual* fixes for VS problems.

Just looks and feels like overengineered madness to me. Like using a shotgun to weed your garden. Their tools just seem to get in their way... well, ever, at all, which is already too much for me.

Then again I decided years ago that if I end up on a career path where I'm writing .NET all day, I'd probably shoot myself.

I think it’s insane that we send so many young, bright, financially broke people to college for CS degrees. Companies should take people in as interns or low paid apprentices where they can work alongside experienced developers. They will leave a six month job with more practice experience than any four year degree would give them. I know and work/have worked with many programmers/developers, and I don’t see any correlation between ability and educational background. I a not suggesting that a degree is not worth anything. I just don’t think it’s fair that people feel that they need to get a degree (and go deep into debt) in order to land that first job. Thankfully it seems that most employers don’t require a formal educational background and count experience (which is far more valuable!). But without a degree, getting that first job can be difficult.;26;6;False;rredline;duwvlac;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"The problem is, how do employers filter out 100s of people that want to become interns without much to show on a resume? It's becoming more and more competitive and students need more to prove what they have accomplished. 

Degrees are hard work for a reason - and while I do agree a lot of the education doesn't apply directly to a future job in that discipline, it at least gives a student a well rounded education, because who knows where they will end up working and what skills they can apply. Most jobs aren't exactly discrete type of work, they take a lot of skills in different areas, and learning those skills comes from how you learn in school. I think education at a university level isn't primarily the knowledge you gain, but the whole challenge. Arriving to classes, taking tests, disciplining yourself to set time aside for studying, building relationships in class, solving unexpected problems, etc. Gaining knowledge is probably 50% of what going to school is about.";3;0;False;tranceology3;dux6ktc;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"The barrier to entry is a required amount of intelligence and ambition. If you want to get into tech simply to make money but otherwise aren't interested and have no natural aptitude, you won't make it very far.

But if you are generally smart and passionate, you'll find there are very few barriers in your way to becoming successful.

I was a hiring manager for software engineers for most of the past 3 years and I've reviewed thousands of resumes, phone screened a few hundred people, and interviewed about a hundred in person. We hired 5 of them. I don't think we were incredibly picky, it's just that most people we interviewed were fucking losers.

I'd say that 50% of the people I talked to who listed C/C++ on their resume couldn't write a for() loop to count to 10. 50% of the people with Java couldn't write a class definition with a couple of empty methods. It was rare to get to the point where we actually asked CS questions because it was clear that they didn't know half the stuff on their resume.

So yeah, I agree that there is a constant flood of people. But most of them suck.

But to keep with the topic of the thread, 2 of the 5 we hired were women even though they made up only 5% of the interview pool. How'd that happen? Because we discriminated? Was there a quota? No, it's that the women who applied tended to be far better applicants than the men. Their actual experience and knowledge matched what was on their resume. I got the feeling that the women wouldn't apply unless they thought they were actually qualified, where many men just blast their resumes out hoping they'll slip through the cracks and get hired accidentally.

When it came down to actually getting a good candidate in an interview who really knew their shit, there was a nearly even split between men and women. There were way more men who were straight up badass coders, but that's more of a minimum requirement than the complete package we were looking for. A big chunk of the badass coder bros were basically robots and weren't very well rounded. People like that suck to work with so we didn't tend to hire them.";7;4;False;signos_de_admiracion;dux1126;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

I have seen many self-taught devs out there. While it is often OK to make apps without any CS background using frameworks and pre-made tools, the moment you're starting to touch something more complicated/unexplored the lack of fundamental knowledge immediately pops out. Many of these self-taught folks do not have enough background in math for example to conduct gamedev, evaluate effectiveness of algorithms or create highly available and stable systems. Talking about crypto it is core & p2p networking which is quite an advanced topic, huge amounts of data, tons of math on which all this stuff based &c. While it is true that you can earn money without enough education, you would be not able to make something really advanced without it. Blockchain has been invented not by script kiddies, but by a real mathematician. It is not just a coincidence.
