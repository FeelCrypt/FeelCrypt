"> Yes it does. Technical change is guaranteed to upset users if the constraints of the system mean that change is mathematically required to restrict the operation in a way that is known would in theory impact an end user's costs or workflow; In this case the in-place change of allocating more databits for divisibility reduces the number of bits available for representing large magnitudes.

largely UI issue for end users, not technical issue, and on technical side (RPC users, automated systems etc.) you can also skip the pains if you give it a little bit of thought (ie. separate API call), and for those reading blockchain separately at a low level, well those people have the skills to adapt.

Not that it’s really relevant but if you have a shit HOA, it’s because nobody wanted to get involved except shit people. Just like government, if you prefer to sit back and “not be hassled and let other people deal with it,” then the ones who will assume control are needle-dicked, authority-craving sociopaths. Nothing will be done unless you get involved and work hard to make it­ not shit. 

For me, I was sort of nominated HOA president because I was the only one who gave a shit about things in my building. It’s been educational for sure. Fortunately my residents are all super chill, but dealing with the neighboring businesses, street trash, and local government has been less chill. Money is always a concern, especially in old buildings. I’ve done a lot of work to make our HOA distinctively unlike the horror stories I’ve heard about them.

"**Frost line**

The frost line—also known as frost depth or freezing depth—is most commonly the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The frost depth depends on the climatic conditions of an area, the heat transfer properties of the soil and adjacent materials, and on nearby heat sources. For example, snow cover and asphalt insulate the ground and homes can heat the ground (see also heat island). The line varies by latitude, it is deeper closer to the poles.

">But that's pc gaming, right? Always something just around the corner. 

You've hit the nail on the head. IIRC there are no monitors on the market capable yet of 4k @ 144hz, there is the ASUS ROG PG27UQ and the ACER predator XB272-HDR.

Both are 4k @144hz with minimal response time, HDR IPS panels with G-sync. The caveat of the perfect gaming monitor is that'll cost $$$. Both were supposed to be released by the end of 2017 so we'll see. In either case, the previews show relatively low FPS at full settings when running dual Titan X in SLI!!!

In other words, we don't have the GPUs available to the public at this time to effectively benefit from such high end monitors.

So people have made the choice that you have, either 4k or 144hz (or ultrawide 21:9). I guess everyone will upgrade when someone can combine those features and we actually have the GPUs that can handle them.

"I posted another reply to OP about the gender stuff - basically that's a super sensationalist headline and all we did was specify that discrimination based on gender identity is not allowed in our existing discrimination laws.  So now that's equal to discriminating based on religion or gender. You're not going to get arrested because you accidentally called someone something they're not, it's more aimed at intentional discrimination - such as firing someone from a job on grounds of gender identity.  Edit: [here’s](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/transgender-rights-bill-senate-1.4163823) a better story if you wanted to read a less biased take on it. 

I would say almost all of Canada's ""behind the times"" characteristics come from how damn spread out our country is. You might find its similar to sparsely populated areas of the US, but I don't know for sure.

First off, the cost of living is higher here. Food, alcohol, basic items, all have a bit of a higher cost because they either need to be imported or transported a very far distance. Nothing is crazy, but the first thing Canadians notice when they travel to the US is how cheap most things are.

I'd say second most important thing is our stupid telecommunications companies. While you guys have it pretty bad with Comcast and stuff, you'd be shocked what we pay for a shit home internet or mobile internet plan. Home internet has been getting slightly better lately, but mobile internet is still garbage (I pay $90/month for 2GB of data and 300 minutes). There's 3 big companies here that pretty much don't compete with each other at all, and there's not much we can do about it. 

Another thing that isn't looking great for Canada's future is how much we rely on fossil fuels. The tide is starting to shift, but a good portion of our economy is still based around oil. While we have the cleanest extraction and processing in the world, we still seem to get the most global pressure since for whatever reason, the Alberta oilfields are one of the most prolific extraction sites in the world.

"I hadn't gotten a chance to try either for more than a few minutes before I made the call. I kinda feel like if I do now that going back to 60 frames will feel disgusting. Right now I can't miss what I've never had. 

Most of the games I play are slower paced (ARMA, various RPGs, Civ, etc) and from what I gathered, I'd appreciate the visuals more than the competitive edge from extra frames. 

Of course, now that I've pulled the trigger, I've been playing nothing but PUBG, CSGO, and League of Legends, where 4k is questionable, useless, and straight up detrimental, respectively. And all of which would benefit massively from 144hz. 

I was thinking of replacing my secondary monitor with 1440/144 if I saw something on sale, but I'm worried that, again, the 60hz on my 4k will feel gross and sluggish if I try to switch back and forth between the two for different games.

"**Liquor Control Board of Ontario**

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a Crown corporation that retails and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout the province of Ontario, Canada. It is accountable to the Ontario Ministry of Finance. It was established in 1927 on the advice of Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson, to sell liquor, wine, and beer. Such sales had been banned outright in 1916; thus, the creation of the LCBO marked an easing of the province's temperance regime (see Prohibition in Canada).

"I actually wasn’t aware of the definitions coming from the ontario human rights commission. Reading through the link to that website though (your first link is giving me a 404), I'm not too worried. I think the most relevant point is this

>	Refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity, or purposely misgendering, will likely be discrimination when it takes place in a social area covered by the Code, including employment, housing and services like education.

The key words here are *refusing* and *purposely*. Again, I think this goes against the title from your daily signal article that seems to suggest that it's illegal to make a mistake. 

The Vancouver Police article is interesting, I don’t remember hearing about that at the time.  I want to do a bit more reading about it, but from that article, I kind of can infer that the person being arrested was asking to be called one thing, but was purposely being called another.  Again, this has the intent I mentioned  

The biggest thing that you might not be aware of is that Canada doesn't have outright free speech. Our free speech ends as soon as you're infringing on someone else's rights, so things like hate speech are illegal. This doesn't mean we can't protest or have discussions, but when things are done in a hateful manner, it's no longer free speech and can be classified as discrimination.

"Interesting. Canada treats bitcoin gain as ""barter for services"", which has its own special tax code. Long story short, you pay tax on it as income at the value it averaged in the year you acquired it. This puts the asset on the books for you, and when you cash out you declare capital gains/losses on the result.

So if you get paid 1BTC during the year and it averages 10k ea during that time, you pay tax on the 10k. If by the end of the year it has dropped to 5k, you declare that as capital losses.

This can create a bit of wonkiness, since capital losses can only be deducted against capital gains. So short term you could be stuck with a notably larger tax bill than your BTC is worth if there's a big crash near the end of the year you got it.

Still, it's a tolerable system I suppose.";1;1;False;;dq8tr6m;Bitcoin Mining in Canada;7evj1h;https://i.redd.it/v2qh3ht1amzz.png

"That headline is *extremely* sensationalist if you read the article.  The bill added some notes on gender to our charter so that it is now illegal to discriminate based on an individual's gender identification. 

It *does not* give law enforcement the ability to arrest someone for using the incorrect gender pronoun, as is suggested by the headline. It just means that (for example) you can't bully or fire someone because they identify as transgender. Same way you can't bully or fire someone because they're a female, or Jewish.

For instance, the onerous cost of putting in fiber leads to a natural monopoly there.

"Well I agree with much if what you've said.

I'll comment though that the ""free market ideologues"" _usually_ try to emphasize not the importance of ""muuuh free market"", but of consumers, people, to communicate to this free market what to supply and what not to supply, with their feet. Specifically, they don't regard a free market as a tool that will just work under all conditions; all markets are made up of individuals choosing means to attain ends, it is the quality of the ends sought and choices made, that translate to how well the market performs.

Now as for the corporatism, intertwining capitalism with government, of course I agree there. But my entire argument is to instead of embrace effective socialism [by regulating net suppliers to the point they are effectively public property, causing them to do the worst job imaginable as socialist 'businesses' do], to combat the corporate cronies instead.

As for government and the cronies being the same people, of course I agree there too. But what they're making use of by infiltrating the government is power given to them by the people, which is why this scam works. The solution is for the people to wake up and deny government the power to rule over them, and in so doing making the cronies wield an impotent weapon, forcing them to revert to their previous way of selling goods people want, or providing services people want to pay for.

It's all very simple, but obfuscated by clever veils of misdirection to the point we have freedom loving people embrace a socialist agenda to try and get back their freedom which they had in the first place but gave away.

"You can't honestly think reiterating how old you are will continue to be compelling.  In that time the manufacturing sector was robust and people could make a good living there, currently the tech and service sectors offer the same opportunity.  The places where what you're saying have some truth to it are especially things like real estate, where prices have dramatically risen as a result of efforts like Bill Clinton's in the 90s to increase homeownership rates.  When the Federal Reserve loans Money at 0% interest to investment bankers, that causes an artificial amount of investment to flow into tech companies whose growth (they don't have to turn a profit because of investment capital and rising stock prices so they just expand) increases demand for housing in the areas those companies are located- another housing bubble.  My contention is that government will always seek to take credit for anything at can to justify its Taxation and control over the people. They claim that regulation was responsible for the fact that working a lower middle-class job could allow you to own a home and put your kids through college during that time. My contention is that economic growth was responsible for that increasing quality of life and that the regulations and actions of government and central banks are responsible for whatever decline in quality life you are referring to. There can be two people who both lived through the span of your lifetime, one who believes economic growth was responsible for the preferable conditions, and another who believes regulatory apparatus and State control of Industry were responsible. There have always been divided camps on this issue.

  I grew up believing everything you're saying like it was obvious, much the way you feel it's obvious right now, but it doesn't hold up to investigation.  The things we are discussing are too large scale for any one person to be able to clearly see them on the ground. One regulation that benefits a worker in a specific industry might have a negative effect on another worker in another industry, or might limit entry to new workers.  These are very complicated questions.  I grew up hearing dogma about how if all labor was Union everybody would have higher wages, without anybody understanding that would mean that everything we buy would cost more unless we open yourself up to trade.  Increased wages mean nothing if the price of everything is increased, and opening ourselves to trade renders union labor uncompetitive and we end up with the result that we have in the United States currently, with all manufacturing going overseas. It takes effort to understand how these things are related and common sense really isn't sufficient.

By that I mean choose or work to realize alternatives when the big corporations refuse to service you to the quality you would like to see, not move physically. I see it happen all around me all the time; small mostly-communal efforts to dig a new line in rural areas. Usually there's multiple companies cooperating advertising slightly different services over a shared line.

> Are these things 'socialism'? When powerful people do things, is that automatically socialism?

No.

> For example, does classifying ISPs as common carriers actually make them effectively public property?

By effective public property I mean that their position in the market is assured by government, _like_ a public property. Whether this is due to a somehow benevolent government granting them this privilege ie. public property through socialism, or lobbyists buying them this privilege using government power ie. effective public property through corporatism (monopolies), is beside the point. The fact remains that under these conditions they only have an incentive to create as much inefficiencies and obstructions in their affairs as they possibly can, and in so doing providing ever diminishing quality of service. My position is that any 'battle' over what these monopolies should look like through things like regulatory frameworks is just horseplay refusing to face any real problems.";1;1;False;Yoghurt114;dq8cxva;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!

"**East India Company**

The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company, was an English and later British joint-stock company, which was formed to pursue trade with the ""East Indies"" (in present-day terms, Maritime Southeast Asia), but ended up trading mainly with Qing China and seizing control of the Indian subcontinent.

Originally chartered as the ""Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies"", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea, and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India.

The company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600, making it the oldest among several similarly formed European East India Companies.

**1954 Guatemalan coup d'état**

The 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état was a covert operation carried out by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution of 1944–1954. Code-named Operation PBSUCCESS, it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian rulers in Guatemala.

The Guatemalan Revolution began in 1944, when a popular uprising toppled the authoritarian Jorge Ubico and brought Juan José Arévalo to power via Guatemala's first democratic election. The new president introduced a minimum wage and near-universal suffrage, aiming to turn Guatemala into a liberal democracy.

Are you implying that if something's 'good for consumers' it's always the right thing to do? No matter how you frame it, if you're asking the government to enforce a transaction where only one party is willing, then it necessarily involves either theft from or slavery of the unwilling party, depending on whether it's a product or a service involved.

Both of those scenarios are morally repugnant.

"You'll *always* have people trying to take power and force you to do stuff. Democracy is the closest we can get to a relatively good freedom. Taxes aren't theft, they are meant to be a redistributive mean to benefit everyone. People will always moan about it because they can't quantify how much it benefits them directly *and* indirectly. Libertarians only look for themselves, it's an extremely short sighted philosophy not capable to handle the challenges humanity is facing : climate change, market distortions and unbalance, inequality, food producing etc. It is also extremely inefficient to only rely on the market and hope that the magic will work, some day... It works in certain cases but not others.    
Another thing I've realized recently : public planning of cities. See, in areas regularly impacted by natural disasters, the state will force heavy regulations to try to mitigate the risks because if you let people doing what they want, such as deforesting (hello Haiti) or building in areas known for potential flooding etc. then everybody is screwed.  
Same for public beaches. People in Mauritius are actually angry at hotels buying beaches, restricting everyone's **freedom** to go to the beach and have a good time. Freedom is a complicated matter that need to take into account all the externalities. If I take the ""freedom"" to buy the beaches or even my own surf spot and forbid everyone to go in (helped by the minor government who will enforce property rights) then I actually impact everyone's freedom.

The entire point of the NN debate is that it will cost more money to use alternatives to facebook and youtube. Remember, facebook and youtube will become customers of the ISPs. They will pay money to ISPs to ensure access to users. So, if I want to watch videos online, it will be either youtube or something that costs more money.

>You've been here for 6 years, how have you managed to remain subservient to authority for that long if I may ask?

That's a little melodramatic, but I will try to answer your question ...

I recognize that the government exists, and I recognize that business/industry exists. I also recognize that they are often run by the same cohort of people. So, when you talk about the government controlling things and when I talk about businesses controlling things, we are really talking about a very similar group of people controlling things. So, how do we make sure that we don't get screwed over by the government or by businesses? We could pretend that we are meaningful actors in a free market chess game, but we are not. Maybe ""free market"" is actually just an ideology, much like Communism in the Soviet Union or the Divine Right of Kings before that. Sure, I like markets a hell of a lot better than those other two options, but I have no illusion that I can depend on markets or central committees or kings to have our best interests at heart.

So, you can see how I find it very unsettling when people who deeply believe in the effectiveness of free markets will blame any shortcomings of their ideology on government interference. When, in fact, this ""free market"" is really just well-connected folks in business and government keeping things kind-of in some sort of balance.

And the thing is, I suspect you already know this. Most people can see that the FCC guy used to work for Verizon. We know about the revolving door of business and govt, Goldman Sachs and the regulators, etc. So if you believe that you can get rid of government and keep the businesses, then you are mistaken. They are made of the same people. You would need to get rid of or take over both! But how would you do that? I am not sure.

"The funny thing is I actually witnessed all those things myself. You have some idea that I'm 20 years old and that allows you to simply state Dennis Kucinich talking points without any evidence to back up your point on our disagreement. I'm no fan of NAFTA, I am against every war in every circumstance in the last century, and what I'm arguing is that regulations create the apparatus necessary for corporations to gain control over the government and squeeze out competition.  This is a often argued economic theory called regulatory capture, and there has been one hundred years of debate on the subject.  Some of the things you're referring to I'm in total agreement with you on, but my point is in every circumstance it's the fact that there's a government to manipulate that allows corporations to manipulate the government.  The growth of these powers that supposedly protect consumers and workers is manipulated by the largest corporations in the world who are the only ones capable of complying with the regulations. This serves as a barrier to entry to new competitors, stifles economic growth and leads towards monopoly.  The reason why we watched wealth inequality rapidly grow recently is that we gave trillions of dollars in bailouts to banks, and then loan them money at 0% interest so they can make profits on investments.  

As far as the manufacturing sector being shipped overseas and its effect on the US, that's a more complicated question. There is a Luddite impulse to associate a certain type of Labor with a certain level of compensation, but in reality the US is at a level of economic development that makes it hard to compete in manufacturing.  Contrary to folk opinion with a minimal amount of training people can make the same or more in new sectors, doing less dangerous jobs.  If we are going to rely on anecdotes, I recently worked on a shipyard on a project that the government controlled, requiring union labor and all the regulations you're talking about.  I was ridiculously overpaid, I worked with pretty much nothing but drug addicts and ex cons, and the result was a project that cost maybe 10 times what it would in a free-market scenario.  Of course that sounds nice for the meth addicts who are working on the the project, but that cost is shifted to the taxpayers and everybody who utilizes the finished product.  If our entire economy was protected in that manner, everything would cost that much. I can see some places where there is dramatic distortion, especially real estate and cost of education (but I believe those to be caused by government), but I also see a whole country full of people complaining and acting as if there are no options while there's money sitting on the table in every direction.  I'm a high-school dropout with completely sporadic work experience and I'm having no trouble in the current climate, I just don't depend on the government to take care of me in every circumstance.

Yeah, no.  The idea was to provide a citation to support your specific statements like ""the fact that most people would have zero alternatives to their current ISP"" not some generic theory.  That said, have you actually read your citation?  Here's a few quotes for you:

""An MC firm can raise its prices without losing all its customers.""  This was my  point regarding bringing up price.

>Freedom of Entry and Exit[edit]

>Like perfect competition, under monopolistic competition also, the firms can enter or exit freely. The firms will enter when the existing firms are making super-normal profits. With the entry of new firms, the supply would increase which would reduce the price and hence the existing firms will be left only with normal profits. Similarly, if the existing firms are sustaining losses, some of the marginal firms will exit. It will reduce the supply due to which price would rise and the existing firms will be left only with normal profit.

So even your citation notes that the problem comes from barriers to entry, like for example regulatory compliance costs.  Imagine that.

>Monopolistically competitive firms are inefficient, it is usually the case that the costs of regulating prices for products sold in monopolistic competition exceed the benefits of such regulation.

"> but they've literally told us their plan if they roll back net neutrality 

To roll it back to the light touch regulation which existed before.  That is literally the administration saying ""we don't think government should be involved"".  Do you know how happy the Bitcoin community would be if that statement was made about it?

Have some philosophical consistency.  Why are you in Bitcoin?

If you really cared about individuals' rights, you would care about the individuals that run and legally own corporations.

You clearly only care about the collective.

"I witnessed the destruction of protective regulations that began with Reagan, were continued by Clinton and Bush, and were completed by the Supreme Court in 2010 like the cherry on top, and saw how they changed the world by turning over wholesale power to the corporations.  I witnessed the results of Clinton disarming the FCC, the creation of NAFTA, and granting permanent normal trade relations to China which allowed corporations to exploit unprotected workers abroad.  Then there was the transformation of our society into one of eternal war and prison under Obama, driven by the military industrial complex, expanding arms of law enforcement, and the for-profit prison industry.  These changes have all been profit motivated by govt officials who allowed themselves to be bought and paid for, and perhaps strong-armed into facilitating them.  This country used to have checks and balances to control corporate greed, and they worked.  I have the perspective that you lack, having witnessed America before and after the checks and balances were abandoned.

But what the hell, even without our country falling into this pathetic state of disrepair, the end will be coming soon with the rise of A.I., or with total environmental collapse because humans are too stupid and too greedy to control our own numbers and to care for land,water, and air, or with a virus with no cure.... pick one.

"So, your response confuses me because it seems like you want NN, but you want it to come from activist consumers who are willing to build their own fiber network? Seems confusing to me.

The reality is that when the FCC repeals NN the ISPs will still have to follow the FCC's rules. It's not like getting rid of NN will get rid of FCC control. In fact, the FCC will impose additoinal regulations on ISPs by creating new reporting requirements for ISPs. So, with NN out of the way, ISPs will have more power over residential customers, and ISPs will still have to submit to the will of the FCC. So, I'm unhappy that net neutrality is gone, and you are unhappy that the FCC still has all the control (plus new regulations). However, the ISPs are happy because they have more control. Can't you see everyone here loses except the FCC and the ISPs? Is that not obvious?

Also, ISPs will still pressure local jurisdictions to maintain their monopoly statuses. In fact, all companies seek monopoly statuses by their very nature.

You can fight high-minded battles about freedom and facing real problems, but at the end of the day your beliefs only strengthen the power of ISPs and ensures that the FCC still remains in power. In effect, your beliefs do nothing for the cause of freedom and do not face real problems. 

So, the question is, what real problems are you correcting? What are you doing for the cause of freedom?

"Raises hand. Though actually in €. 

I'm happy I had BTC on my balance for the taxes ever since 2012. I've paid into thousands of €s tax, for not hiding my BTC from them. Hiding would have been easy though: as simple as not telling.

However, I don't mind paying taxes that much, because I see it as my contribution to the funds we as a community need to do things for ourselves, as a community. (Note that this is not the same as paying as much taxes as I want, nor that this means I won't try to pay as little as legally possible).

The other good thing, is that now that I am extracting part of that money (to buy a house) I don't have to explain where the money comes from. 

Or, actually, I had to explain it to the notary (some laundering-law) and simply offering my relevant tax-papers was enough.

Last positive thing, is that in our local tax laws, BTC wealth is taxed as wealth (like an expensive piece of art would be) which is taxed relatively heavily (yea, communist europe :)). However, the alternative would have been to put it in the papers as ""income from X"", which would not have been entirely correct in the first place (but probably explainable), yet taxed even more. Up to 60% or so I was told. 

Which means I woul'dve payed more than the amount my house cost to the taxes.

"It's not about how much they are worth now. If you plan to have $100 in bitcoins and don't really plan to do much with it then yes no need to do taxes. But if you're playing with 10k or more and you have transactions going through your bank you might want to cover your ass. The IRS ain't someone to fuck with and they can get records from these exchanges and they will be going after people as Crypto becomes more mainstream.

(For USA) If you buy something directly with bitcoin do you still have to pay taxes or is it only if you convert back to USD?;56;3;False;bluethunder1985;dq8pc8z;I was trying to buy a game on Steam, had no idea they accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment.

Yes you are supposed to pay taxes. You do not pay taxes when you USD to crypto. Taxes occur when you Crypto to anything else including other cryptos. If you bought 100 bitcoins for $100 dollars last year and now it's worth $1000 you have to pay the increase of value on what ever bitcoins you use. If you use 1 bitcoin (originally worth $1 now worth 10$) you have to pay the increased value of $9 as capital gain in taxes.;17;3;False;thune123;dq8wkda;I was trying to buy a game on Steam, had no idea they accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment.
