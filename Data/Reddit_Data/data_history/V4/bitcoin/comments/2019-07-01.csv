Every time a rich dynasty is extinguished, their coin is lost forever. Value being thus removed from circulation, the demand for BTC temporarily outweighs the offer, and everyone's coin gains value in relation to other assets until a new equilibrium is found. This is only possible until a satoshi is worth too much to still assure high fungibility, one of Bitcoin's main advantages over gold.;1;0;False;TenshiS;esidorj;When all in 100% Bitcoin, with little cash in the bank;c77n54;https://i.redd.it/y362d9fwhe731.jpg

"Nope if you make it to 60 your expected life is a extra 26 years.  Average is 86. That's why I said you are doing life expectancy wrong, because you are making the same mistake everyone makes in interpreting it.

The total average is around 78.0, but that includes people who died young due to stupidity, terminal illness, infant mortality, etc. When you look at the conditional average (IE the average given that you've already reached a give age) that number drastically increases.

You don't look at total, you look at conditional when dealing with life expectancy.";1;0;False;LoyalSol;eshn2j2;When all in 100% Bitcoin, with little cash in the bank;c77n54;https://i.redd.it/y362d9fwhe731.jpg

"They would prefer to not have taxes taken out of their paychecks, to not have to file returns, and to not have to deal with the IRS.

They would prefer, I suppose:

* a small tax on financial transactions (Tobin tax)
* a VAT
* a legal Treasury-issued currency instead of the counterfeit private banker money the government has been borrowing from inbred psychopath bankers since 1913

among other things. It will be a very easy sell.";3;0;False;diydude2;esg1xew;When all in 100% Bitcoin, with little cash in the bank;c77n54;https://i.redd.it/y362d9fwhe731.jpg
