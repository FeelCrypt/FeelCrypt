"They interviewed me for that article. I'm pretty sure it was that one. I posted about it on Facebook and a journalist (friend of a friend, iirc) asked me for a statement. This was years ago now so I can't say for sure it was for that article, but it seems likely.

And I know this stuff because the guy who interviewed me told me. I got the impression he was struggling against an entrenched culture of bad code and practises. He looked at me as someone who could be an ally in implementing and advocating the sort of things he wanted to do. 

It's worth pointing out conversations like this are not at all uncommon in a tech interview. People are often pretty open about the shortcomings in their practices because they don't want to give false expectations and actively want to change. 

Honestly hadn't realised this was such a controversial statement. I wouldn't have bothered commenting if I realised what a bunch of BS would spin out of it.

"Let's not assume we know what consciousness is.

Also I doubt any AI will be created that has no hard and fast rules about what it's supposed to do and not do. We will create AI to learn about specific fields of interest, not a general AI to just let loose on the world and say, ""let's see what it does!""

Also, machines connected to the internet would need to have significant control over our lives for any AI to cause apocalypse.

Lastly, correct me if I'm wrong, but quantum communication is supposed to be unhackable, so not even a super AI can hack it, theoretically. Unless it's so advanced it does something we could never have conceived of. But we could go anywhere with that. It could create a wormhole for demons from another dimension to come through, too...anything is possible, but let's not go down that rabbit hole.";1;0;False;garbonzo607;dnsv24t;Head of the Pack: Japan Endorses 11 Cryptocurrency Exchanges, Aims to Become Bitcoin Powerhouse;73kxgy;http://www.cryptoanalyst.co/2017/10/01/japan-endorses-11-bitcoin-exchanges/

"They can start by informing the current MtGox bankruptcy trustee that the accounts should be re-evaluated when it comes to distribution, instead of giving the guy who knowingly committed fraud all the excess value after giving creditors $450 per coin they had on the exchange.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, in order to submit a claim on the 202k bitcoins still in possession, you had to agree to a $480 valuation per btc. Years later, the coins are now worth 10x that, but creditors (people who had btc on there) are by law only owed $480 per btc. Mt Gox can basically pay everyone off at that low, low price, and the owner, who used the exchange as his own piggy bank, lots btc in hacks, had no idea how many bitcoins he actually had, and disclosed NONE of it until now, could walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. In the meantime, people have still lost 600k bitcoins.
