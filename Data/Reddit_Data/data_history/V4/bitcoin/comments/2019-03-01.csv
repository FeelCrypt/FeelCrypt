Yeah there's a pretty good chance that you just talked to the wrong division in the state. Here's what happens. The bank will send the money to the state after a period of inactivity. At that point it will go into a lost funds record. I had the same thing happen and it took me some phone calls and a little digging to get my money back but believe me you definitely can . it will be linked to your social security number most likely and you can search for it on various State websites that have to do with lost property. It took me about 30 minutes in my state to get it all figured out and eventually I got the right person on the phone that found it and they told me how to get it back. You might find a couple of employees who just don't want to deal with you and play the transfer game.

"I’m not sure about the time exactly.  I managed an account where I had to escheat funds every year.  I believe it was 2 years, could be 3 though that funds would have to be sent to unclaimed property for inactive accounts.  It likely varies by state, bc it’s the state department of banking that you send the unclaimed funds to.  It also depends on how diligent the bank or financial institution is about escheating funds.  Financial institutions get audited by the state department of banking annually if not more frequently, so there’s no way to avoid it.   I’d imagine a bank like Wells Fargo is very diligent and likely has it automatically setup so they don’t incur fines or lose their license.

Honestly, that would pass the smell test on paper.  But, it’s hard to say what sort of algorithm/formula they use to measure the metric for inactivity.  For me, any movement would’ve sufficed, but a $1 xfer back and forth would’ve been a bit suspect.  It may be that you have to make a deposit > $X, or some percentage of what’s currently on deposit.  Likewise for writing a check from your checking account.  Honestly, without knowing more about your situation I can’t be of any real help.  I’d suggest contacting your bank and asking them directly.  Sometimes you just have to make contact via writing to maintain activity in the account(I.e. the bank would send you something about account activity, you sign it and send it back to them) and you’re good to go, no need for transfer.;2;0;False;Texadoro;ehl5o0m;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg

From what i know as soon as you give the money to the bank, its not your money anymore, its bank's money, you exchanged your money for a contract between you and the bank, on the bank's terms, the bank gave you no option to negociate it. If you can't get your money, by traditional means, the last option is always to take them to court the bank or the state whoever has the money, the trick is both bank and state can change laws and rules about what happens to the money without asking or informing you, because its a centralized system.;4;1;False;DimZod;ehjcp9x;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
