Hi guys! need some info here. since most of the well known non profits in USA are i think registered as 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organizations which i think to file for this and eligibility is cheaper than in my country and The initial fund contribution to start a foundation is P1,000,000  --that is around $20,000 in our money in which maybe  less  than 10% of the population can afford it to qualify and to obtain this status which its really crazy. lol! I mean I have met people that do good things to other people but it just difficult because of these things. Is there such thing as getting the 501 c3 status for non-US residents? there's a lot of barriers to be considered as a non profit organization in my country.

TBI and PTSD often go hand in hand and the symptoms are similar enough that someone diagnosed with PTSD very well might actually be dealing with TBI. Or be dealing with PTSD from the TBI. 

Either way, the only advice I gave was a friendly starting point for the individual to do their own research. Also, I’ve never heard of AlphaMale Institute and I don’t believe Dr. Mark Gordon is in anyway affiliated with them.

"Awesome! There is another small Dutch organization aimed to make the actual psychedelic *therapy* accessible as soon as possible (MDMA first), called [the OPEN Foundation](https://www.stichtingopen.nl/open_eng/about-open/). Based in the most liberal country in the world (you have to answer questions in the Netherlands, ha!), I am confident they can pave the way.

> OPEN is currently building an international platform for the training, education and supervision of mental health care professionals working with psychedelic substances, in collaboration with leading experts and organisations in the field.

"Im well aware people develop issues from it but its from long term use not one use unless they vastly overdosed on it, which again, is not an issue if used responsibly or under supervision. Again all those things are from people who abused it. Im not finding any modern journals showing it causing problems due to neurotoxicity in the recommended dose range and used rarely. If im missing one id be happy to read it and discuss from there but at the moment you are arguing anecdotes from bluelight. Im not seeing anything on ncbi, google scholar, psychinfo, etc showing it from single use or even sparse use. All these recent clinical trials all are monitoring their patients. MRIs, CTs, etc.

Dont get me wrong, I lean on the side of caution with MDMA due to its neurotoxicity. Not more then a few times a year but it can be used safely and doctors/scientists are researching it being used safely and if they come to the conclusion that it is safe if used correctly, and that it can help people, then I see no reason why we should let people suffer due to misinformation. 

Using proper harm reduction techniques can prevent the conditions that lead to neurotoxicty. Its believed that overheating from use is one of the strongest contributors to the potential damage. This older comment is better spoken then mine and has its sources to check out (though the MAPS ones are broken but can be found elsewhere).

"Wow!  This study shows an outstanding result!  I had heard of MDMA being studied for the treatment of PTSD but had no idea it was proving such efficacy.  MAPS is doing great work here and I support it and their work in finding better treatments using a variety of drugs, especially psychedelics as many of them were, in fact, originally developed for therapeutic use.  I believe that any substance that can treat illness better than what is currently used should be available to those who need it, not withheld simply because the government decided that it's abuse potential is too high.

Thank you Pineapple Fund for supporting what looks to be a very exciting and promising project that will have major impact on those that suffer from PTSD.

I also want to note that the business structure of a 501(c)(3) owning a for-profit corporation, including a public benefit corporation, is absolutely a great practice!  It's the same approach that BTRIC takes to incubating projects that focus on emerging technology.  We research develop and incubate under BTRIC and when they're viable businesses, we divest them into separate entities.  I've had to explain this to donors several times and I just wanted to chime in and say that yes it's absolutely legal and is done by many organizations.  A non-profit cannot engage in any significant for-profit activity, but they can own businesses that do.  The profits of the business are considered like any investment gain that is held by a non-profit would be.  We are going to be publishing guidance regarding this type of structure under Creative Commons license to encourage wider use in emerging technology projects.  I believe it's a great, ethical and sustainable, business model that needs wider attention and adoption.

Good luck on this fundraising campaign, it can really do a lot of good for a lot of people!

"And you ignore history. 

Look up Snuff box and the typical use of Cocaine prescribed by Docs. 

Look up Heroin treatment. That's right ""treatment,"" back when you use to get Heroin pumped into your veins again as prescribed by a Doc. 

Take a peak at modern day Methodone clinics and the epidemic that shit is. Hell Manitoba has great statistics if you want to go there. AGAIN the Medical Porfessionals are the ones behind the drug. 

Docs have a history of prescribing narcotics for financial gains.

"How can you read those old medical journals and not at least be a bit skeptical of this?

Methodone is today man, not yesterday, not decades ago, today! It has got to the point of being an epidemic in the Canadian Province of Manitoba. Do to my brother's struggle with drugs (specifically Heroin) I've come to know the topic. 

He broke his Heroin habit, he struggles to overcome Methodone. Yet every Doc says the former is much worse then the latter. Yet those taking the drug say the opposite and call the Doctors liars. The former drug addicts feel they've been cheated by a monthly prescription fee. 

You are ignoring so much data on the table in pursuit of fuzzy feelings. Doctors will always view themselves as saviours out to do good. Yet if you talk to their clients, they aren't doing so hot. 

The responsibility is to the user, but letting the Docs off Scott free for a history of social drug addiction and the role they played is just such a farse. 

If you ""cure"" a disease with a drug (of any sort) then addiction is a likelihood and the negative effects on society are evident. Meanwhile Docs profit huge. I'm sorry but I'm not ok with that.

"**Skeptical movement**

The skeptical movement (also spelled sceptical) is a modern social movement based on the idea of scientific skepticism (also called rational skepticism). Scientific skepticism is the application of skeptical philosophy, critical thinking skills, and knowledge of science and its methods to empirical claims, while remaining agnostic or neutral to non-empirical claims (except those that directly impact the practice of science). The movement has the goal of investigating claims made on fringe topics and determining if they are supported by empirical research and are reproducible, as part of a methodological norm pursuing ""the extension of certified knowledge"". The process followed is sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry.

"Quebec was fishing for tech giants but caught bitcoin miners.

At least that’s how David Vincent, business development director at electric utility Hydro Quebec, describes the results of a campaign launched in 2016 to lure the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to build their data centers in the Canadian province.

The sales pitch was simple: the province offers plentiful, cheap and renewable electricity, along with cold weather and a politically stable environment.

And while Hydro Quebec has gotten plenty of bites from traditional data center operators, the company also quickly discovered those same traits are equally attractive for cryptocurrency mining operations.

Nonexistent just six months ago, interest in Quebec from commercial-scale bitcoin miners has skyrocketed, Vincent said, amid the surge in cryptocurrency prices and political uncertainty in other jurisdictions.

For Hydro Quebec, 35 cryptocurrency mining organizations are asking the company for information regarding connecting to the power grid there. Those companies now account 70 percent of the total wattage capacity in Hydro Quebec's development pipeline.

In an interview with CoinDesk, Vincent said:

“I have so much demand right now there’s no need for marketing. Pretty much every day I have a new one.”

And sentiments from others suggest what Hydro Quebec is seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg.

""Based on what I've seen in equipment purchase, real estate and power deals, things are exploding in Quebec,"" said Austin Hill, the former CEO of Blockstream, who is now investing in and backing some of the mining projects looking to Quebec.

Cheap and abundant

Cryptocurrency mining – the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain – generally requires specialized hardware (either ASICs or GPUs) to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Because of the vast amount of computing power that's used, mining rigs generate a significant amount of heat, which is why mining operations look for colder environments to set up shop.

But it's not only the cold weather that's a draw for Quebec. The government's aggressive effort, during the post World War II era, to build dams in its northern regions has proven enticing enough to pull mining operators away from existing bases that already have weather on their side.

Because of that work, Quebec has become one of the largest hydroelectric power producers in the world. Hydro Electric, with 37,000 megawatts of installed electricity capacity, routinely produces at surplus levels and is thus able to offer some of the lowest rates in North America to its commercial customers.

For data centers, Hydro Quebec charges as low 2.48 cents (in USD) per kilowatt hour, and 3.94 cents per kilowatt-hour for bitcoin miners (the slight increase for the latter due to mining operations' smaller job creation and economic development footprint), Vincent said. These rates are anywhere from 50 percent to three times lower than in comparable parts of North America, according to data compiled by Hydro Quebec.

Historical consistency in pricing over time, and the assurance that the rates are not simply teasers that will jump overnight, are a key part of the value proposition for cryptocurrency mining operations, Vincent said. He added:

""We always succeed at staying below inflation. It’s been like that since 1963 and it’s not going to change.""

And while some have argued that cryptocurrency mining is environmentally degrading, there's a growing trend by these mining operations toward finding competitive advantage via greater energy efficiency and resource optimization.

""In some hotter environments, the current ASIC equipment ends up having a very short shelf life of around six to nine months because it gets so hot, and the cost of cooling it isn’t worth the cost of the equipment,"" Hill, who heads the Montreal-based Brudder Ventures, said, adding:

""It’s just easier to run it super hot, throw it away and buy a new one. It’s hugely wasteful.""

And moving to cooler climates, like Quebec, could help.

Political stability

Another driver behind Quebec’s accidental emergence as a cryptocurrency mining hub is that miners are increasingly looking for stable political environments where they can deploy their capital investments and plan their business efforts four to five years in advance with a higher degree of confidence.

While several of Hydro Quebec's interested parties are based in North America, a significant number of mining organizations hail from countries, notably China, where the landscape for cryptocurrency mining, and cryptocurrencies in general, has become cloudier.

In China, for instance, rumors have been surfacing that the government plans on withdrawing preferential benefits such as cheap electricity and tax deductions to bitcoin mining operations. Plus, the People's Bank of China has been one of the more aggressive regulators in the world when it comes to cryptocurrency, most recently issuing a ban on initial coin offerings and moving to shut down bitcoin exchanges.

Notably, Vincent said mining interest in Quebec began to tick upward significantly last fall after these moves by China.

He told CoinDesk:

""They don’t say it like that, but the fact that the rush of the demand came at pretty much the same time they were having problems in their previous jurisdiction, we could think there was a correlation.""

These concerns, along with a steady flow of reports about mining equipment seizures, kidnappings and game-playing by corrupt public officials in places like Venezuela, could make setting up shop in places where these risks are minimal more important than ever for mining operators.

A good problem

While Hydro Quebec is still, admittedly, trying to fully grasp this new class of customers, it’s been more than willing to roll out the welcome mat for them because of the enormity of the requests, not to mention the 24/7 nature of their operations.

To show mining operation's scale, Vincent compared them to Hydro Quebec's other customers.

Its smallest commercial customers, such as the Montreal Canadiens’ hockey arena, require five megawatts of electricity and a typical data center requires 30 to 60 megawatts. By contrast, ""the top-three to top-five miners in world, most of them are talking to us, and the demand that they have right now is around 200 to 300 megawatts,"" he said. ""It’s huge.""

But with an industry as volatile as cryptocurrency, nothing is fully set in stone, and as a risk-averse, publicly owned utility, Hydro Quebec is minimizing its exposure by requiring miners to foot the upfront cost of the power connection and arrange a line of credit from a third party large enough to offset any losses in the event of something dire.

""The question for us is: is this a trend that will continue to stay at least as strong as it is right now?"" Vincent said.

But for now, the biggest problem facing Hydro Quebec is finding enough buildings and locations that are suitable to be used as mining farms, as well as hiring more people who can help meet all of the requests from these types of potential clients, as quickly as they are coming in.

""[The miners] have this impression that they’re losing money every day, so they’re asking for big buildings with big interconnections and they want it tomorrow,"" Vincent said, concluding:

""We have the capacity, but we’re not used to having so much big demand like this. It’s a good problem to have.""

No. Each bitcoin is earned by doing the real and increasingly expensive and difficult work of registering data immutably on the bitcoin blockchain. That immutability gives an earned bitcoin its market value. The fact that a limit of 21 million bitcoins was established from the start does *not* make them a creation by fiat.

"Which is why when people have two spendable currencies, one that goes up in value, one that goes down, they spend the one that goes down first.

This is the dynamic that keeps deflationary currency out of circulation. As soon as a currency becomes more valuable as an asset than a currency people start hoarding it and stop spending it. Aristophanes writes over 2000 years ago how people hoarded gold coins and only spent base metal coins.

It's the reason no countries are still minting gold coins for actual use. Gold coins everywhere in the world have been retired as an active currency, people only use them as assets now. There's no reason anyone would ever spend a gold coin when you can spend a paper note or nickel coin instead.";1;0;False;suninabox;dskhyki;KFC Canada accepts Bitcoin!!!!;7pryna;https://twitter.com/kfc_canada/status/951567247583137792

Thanks for pointing this out. I'm wondering why there's not more discussion of the fact that bitcoin payments via BitPay are impossible from traditional bitcoin wallets.

For those who haven't experience it, in the past BitPay gave a bitcoin address, an amount to pay and a stress inducing timer. Now they give an indecipherable code, along with a link that says ""hey, if you don't know how to pay this, you should switch to using our wallet.""

"Multiple times in the past two weeks I was sent to BitPay to pay an invoice. In the past this meant I got an address, an amount of bitcoins to send to that address, and a timer.  These recent times I instead got a url like

bitpay.com/i/randomcode

where the randomcode is not a bitcoin address. There was a link with a question like, ""how do I pay this when there is no address?"" I followed the link and it said I needed to use a special kind of wallet, like the one provided by BitPay. One of those times it was for a payment over $150. In every case I gave up and contacted the vendor to cancel the purchase.

The good news is that one of those vendors added an alternative way to pay in bitcoin (or other alts) using a different payment processor to BitPay, so not only are there alternatives to BitPay (""coingate"" in this case), BitPay is helping drive business to those alternatives.

I do suspect there will be a lot of confusion if BitPay starts using Bcash instead of Bitcoin, and calling Bcash Bitcoin. And I strongly suspect that's where we're heading. Same with Coinbase.

">You can always buy the same amount off an exchange to prevent speculative loss using fiat as you pay the merchant in Bitcoin

Why would you spend bitcoin and then immediately rebuy the same amount of bitcoin in fiat rather than just spend fiat directly given fiat is quicker and cheaper and you wouldn't have to pay fees to an exchange to keep the same amount of bitcoin?

It's just wasting space on the blockchain for you to end up with exactly the same amount of bitcoin but less fiat from what you lost in fees.
 
Such behavior proves you're not treating it as a currency but as an investment.

Imagine the same person you paid in bitcoin was the same person you bought bitcoin back off to see how nonsensical it is:

""I'd like to buy a car please"", ""that'll be 1 bitcoin"", ""here you go. can I buy that bitcoin back please?"" ""that'll be $15,000""

You dont really have to wait for any confirmations with in store purchases, you can  accept a low dollar transaction the moment it hits the mempool and assuming it has sufficient fees. Your risk will be much lower than accepting credit card payment. You do need confirmations when there is a risk of double spend attack, which would be online when you can time your transaction to coincide with a block you found but held back. Again, for low value transactions, it really isnt a big risk. Who's going to risk witholding a 12.5 BTC block to have a chance at a free chicken? Fees is a different matter.

"Agreed.  The US will never ban crypto because they know that Russia and China would simply take full advantage, and vice versa.  The superpowers may not like crypto, but they are kind of held hostage by that fact.

I'm sure it is very worrying for governments, however, as crypto is going to be massively empowering for the people.  For the most part, governments will no longer be able to force people to pay taxes.  Instead, people will pay taxes because they *want* to pay them.  As a result, politicians will have to get off of their asses and actually deliver results.
