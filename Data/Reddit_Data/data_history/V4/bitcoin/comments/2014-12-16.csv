"My body is my property. I exchanged my labor for resources and built capital, and eventually I also traded it for land.

My parents wanted kids and they were efficient enough to build resources to provide me with food so they could have kids. This allowed me to grow into an independent person that can provide value to someone else in exchange for the goods I use to survive.

"Depends which event you're referring to.

When the American Neo-Liberal's and their pals the Chicago boys shocked Chile into capitalism and installed Pinochet, he killed tens of thousands, tortured many more and ""dissapeared"" (read left on the roadside with single bullet wound to the head as a warning to others) thousands more, pretty much anyone who was a political opponent. Not to mention the 200,000 odd that simply fled.

All in the name of forcing neo-liberal capitalism onto the Nation.

Despite killing and dissapearing his opponenets, the people rose up and it only lasted 10 years before they regained some form of democracy, but their entire economy and social structure was ruined forever.


Or maybe Iraq? Where they're still trying to figure out how many people were killed in the attempt to turn Iraq into ""the Dubai or Singapore of the Middle East."" (ie, a friendly, market based economy open to foreign investment)

Let alone the enormous economic damage and pain and sufferring from having their National wealth wiped out paying American companies to kinda rebuild the place, with imported labour and materials at extortionate prices. (those cost + contracts allow American company's to charge the American tax payer, and the host Nation ""whatever it costs, plus profit.""

(Wait, we're broke? We need Austerity? And you paid Haliburton HOW MUCH to partially, and badly rebuild iraq in a failed experiment?) - hint it was in the region of $20bn to Haliburton.

Or perhaps the economic failure caused by forcing Gorbachev out and replacing him with Yeltsin as a frontman to force Chicago boys style capitalism onto the Russian people? Or is it the sufferring the Russian people still feel today at the Mafia capitalism we left them with?


Hell, at least those Countries kept their pain and sufferring to themselves. They didn't go on a highly profitable tour of the World trying to kill and intimidate their economic plans onto everyone else.


Or are you talking about the actual American people? those who die because they can't afford healthcare? Or the huge portion of a specific racial group imprisoned for profit? Or the way that economics in the USA are failing right now, banks too big to fail, completely out of control inequality, rapid destruction of our planet (for profit) and a complete and utter lack of real democracy?

I'm not sure which thing you're referring to.

From where I'm standing, a reasonable understanding of economics, a half decent knowledge of history and managaing to avoid the American neo-liberal indoctrination as much as possible, kinda make the American neo-liberals look like one of the worst evils this World has ever seen.

At least Hitler kept his focus on specific groups, and at least Saddam kept his brutality to his own people, seems American neo-liberals will destroy anyone who gets in their way no matter what race, colour or creed they are, well, they'll help someone else to do it, save getting their own hands dirty, keep that facade up, and will literally brain wash the children at home, via every possible channel, almost a bombardment to overload the senses, to think they're the good guys and their way is the only way.

Thought Obama would be an end to it. But turns out he's just another pointless face in the sham democracy they fool the American people so well with.

Maybe secure some ""freedom"" at home, before forcing, militarily, your kind of ""freedom"" on other Nations eh.";1;0;False;TheBestWifesHusband;cmwfayx;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
">what capitalist country has killed 10s of millions of its own citizens?

Are you suggesting that deaths of those in another country don't matter as much as your own?

The difference is that the US rarely annexes countries which are in its sphere of influence, so while the deaths in Ukraine are attributed to the USSR, people like you can brush off the countless people the US killed in places like Bolivia since it isn't a state. But you can rest assured, the deaths in Bolivia and Chile are as much on the hands of american politicians as those in any other part of the American Empire.

If countries had to annex those they took over rather than just install a puppet then the US would be a lot bigger, and it would be a little easier to see how bloody its history truly is.";2;1;False;xian16;cmwoiq4;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg

"> As an example: dumping toxic waste into a lake is cheaper than paying to have it properly disposed of. 

Extremely bad example.
For instance, in a free market the owner of the lake would have protecting the lake in it's own interests (to avoid devaluation of the property). This is orders of magnitude more efficient than the government. The core issue is that what is everyone's really is noone's. That's why it's so cheap to dump toxic waste in a lake. Because the value of the lake's property is orders of magnitudes higher than the amount needed to corrupt those in charge of looking after the lake. They have nothing to lose, profits go in their pockets and losses are socialised. 

I want capitalism because I do not want to hold the bag on toxic water reserves in name of ""common good"". If someone wants to poison their own water, let them do it.

I am not sure how you expect such a scheme to work. I mean, it would be pretty nice, but unfortunately resources and labour are not unlimited on our planet.
