"That right there is a problem that is solvable.  Other companies manage to do it; it's not very difficult.  It does require having several people on staff just to handle customer service, internal communication & delineated responsibilities, and clear policies that are refined over time.

"That may be, but they could communicate better and retain more customers/avoid posts like this...
The fact that they are probably complicating things with software is part of the problem.  It's pretty simple to put in place an efficient customer service queuing system with off the shelf software/email and general policies like responding to every email within 48 hrs. even if just to say ""Sorry you're having an issue; we're looking into it and will give you an update in x days.""


I believe they just don't care and think customer service is not an important part of their business; at least not important enough to staff a customer service dept. properly.

"No, they mucked up their SPF record. Or for some reason GMail displayed this: ""It has a from address in kraken.com but has failed kraken.com's required tests for authentication.""


They are using a third party support system (zendesk, if I recall correctly), but instead of sending emails from, let's say kraken@just-a-regular-nice-client-of.zendesk.com they make zendesk send out support@kraken.com emails, but for that to be even remotely valid they need to whitelsit zendesk's outgoing IP in their SPF record. (Which I just checked, and they now indeed do.)

Also, I tried to decipher the email/MIME/SMTP headers, to figure out whether they used DKIM or not, but it's just a mess (because it's a redirected google apps domain, it has a lot of added headers), but it has at least one dmarc=fail line.

So, they were actively using a system that was not playing nice by Google's rules. Which is basically the complete first step, the very-much-not-gold but common gravel standard of customer support, that it should work in GMail.

All in all, I'm not trying to amass the pitchforks against them, because they do care about security and they are at least trying to do the right thing, when it comes to email. But not making sure that their chosen setup works in gmail, now, that's a big no-no.";6;1;False;Pas__;d1e00i1;Sold ~$5800 worth of BTC through Coinbase this week. $2490 has never been deposited.

"I want to assert that the OP jumped the gun on his social media exposure. 

As I've now said about three times I would be interested to see posts saying ""Coinbase has ignored my ticket for a week, WTF?!"". But we don't see those posts because Coinbase does deal with support in a sensible timeframe.

Look back at OP's timeline. The problem withdrawal was on Monday night way after business hours, so effectively Tuesday. His other withdrawals took 2 days to go through. So, although the missing confirmation email may have peturbed him, his money wasn't really missing until Thursday. On Friday (and a holiday in many parts) he posts to Reddit.

So how long do you think Coinbase was ""unresponsive"" for?

He didn't just speak out in favour of a blocksize hardfork (which is his right, although he should have shown a lot more discretion). People, including me, are thoroughly pissed off at him for directly attacking the bitcoin developers and running â€˜technicalâ€™ arguments against them that were naive and frankly, an embarrassment to him (the infamous â€˜multiple browsers analogyâ€™ slideshow).

"Yes, for the full text I was referring to Chase. Not coinbase, as a responsive entity.

As of today, they still have not responded. I'm ready to move on from Coinbase. 

Thought they were a cool, SF company, changing the planet. Looks like I was blinded by the hipster web site, and Kalifornia vibe.  

Suggestions for another vendor?

Jesus, one of the very best features about bitcoin is the speed of transactions. Even using a Bitcoin ATM delivers your funds within half an hour (at most, unless the network is enduring another stress test). If Coinbase is going to offer this service, they have to be better at their jobs than the average bankster. They may have grown too big, too fast, and are bending over backwards to  please the regulators, but they are extremely vulnerable to being upstaged by new, more agile competitors who can provide better service. With as much funding as they have acquired, their customer service should be top-notch. Since it is far from satisfactory, they need to up their game or fall by the wayside.

"A perspective about bumping tickets in any situation that involves livechats/calls: (although yes, from the info you provided in this post, I feel like you went an appropriate route):

> Henry: I see you already have an open support ticket with a supervisor. You're going to need to wait for a reply via email. Live chat cannot help, I'm afraid.

I work in tech support and understand his reply. I have a canned response that I sometimes have to pull out. Two techs working on the same server/issue never works out too well; it simply means more communication between technicians which slows things down.

> _I would suggest using the ticket as your primary line of communication with us. Keeping the issue to the ticket streamlines our ability to solve the issue efficiently and correctly; otherwise there could be delays caused as we communicate with the technician on the ticket._

I don't pull this out on the first time...but there are some people who will like 'bump', 'accelerate', 'prioritize', and so on, their tickets.

Again, from what info you've provided in the post I feel like you had an appropriate response here. I just like to share perspectives from a support agent from time to time.
