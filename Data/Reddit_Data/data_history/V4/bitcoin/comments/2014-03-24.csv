Your 99 out of 100 people statistic is way off. But then to say we need those 99 people is even more off! If one out of every hundred people used bitcoin that would be like 80 million people!!!!

"Ill bet you didnt know the crack epidemic in the 80s and 90s was caused by the US government to fund black ops through the sale of crack cocaine. Its well documented, even wikipedia says it(not a ""reliable"" source so look around for many other sources, its know its proven. Governments profit from drugs being illegal, they are playing you.

"Take some time to look up countries that legalized drugs, then look at there drug use/addiction rate. They went down!!!! You need to get out of bitcoin BRO, this is NEVER going to become what you want it to.
Fucking idiot, this is a tool to beat governments and their fucked up laws.

People like you are why marijuana is illegal.
Lets make tobacco and alcohol illegal, how about that? Ohhhh noooo the government say alcohol is ok so it must be way less harmful than any other drug. Dont mind your liver, or the lack of fluid around your brain to protect it from bashing into your skull, no thats fine!!!

"In YOUR OPPINION drugs shouldn't be illegal. Every government in the world and 99 people out of 100 would disagree. Unfortunately, bitcoin needs both of these groups to succeed. It most definitely does not need, nor should the community want, the ""drugs are cool"" crowd to be associated with it.

"Dude get off your high horse, governments are understanding wars on drugs are useless, to make something that only harms the user illegal is STUPID, lets make ferraris illegal, lots of owners get injured in crashes. You are content with being mislead and misinformed by your government, so bitcoin is obviously not for you. 

Drugs aren't bad, drug addiction is bad.
