That's awesome advice, thanks. I figured my experience translating wouldn't help, mostly just included that to emphasize that I'm already a fair bit into my working life. I built a few small projects during camp but will start planning and looking to build something larger and more long term. I'm hoping to transition sometime within the next year, hopefully it will work out! Thanks again, have a great day!;1;0;False;Yuanlairuci;e5ng5dn;Altcoin Master;9dyk1w;https://i.redd.it/febayr7qsvk11.jpg

Not like the organizers personally wanted ME, but I was on the list of people the request went out to.  I could have presented if I really wanted to, but I would have had to get myself to Taiwan or something.
