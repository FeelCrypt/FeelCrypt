Also billions can be created simply by people not selling which forces buyers to raise their bids to entice a sale.
    
The last sale price is what determines the current value and in turn people use that to determine their current net worth with that asset.

This is the biggest misconception about crypto-currencies.
There is no barrier.
1 ""milli-bitcoin"" / ""millibit"" (mBTC) is worth $5.
1 ""bit"" / ""micro-bitcoin"" (uBTC) is worth $0.005
You can buy any denomination and enjoy gains because profit is determined by percentage increase, no matter how much you put in.
Imagine 1 millibit going from $5 to $100? $1000?
Do you really think you're late to this?

At that point it will be more suitable as a currency.

This 'distributed' type of network makes it impenetrable to attackers - if they take down one node then the whole network already exists on thousands of other nodes, and anyone can just download the network and run a full node themselves.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies employ a 'blockchain' data structure - basically a public ledger that keeps track of all transactions that have occurred. Before a transaction is added to the ledger, it has to pass advanced cryptographic treatment that ensures that the transaction is legitimate. Certain nodes are constantly running algorithms to verify the legitimacy of each transaction (these are called 'miners', and get rewarded in bitcoin every time they are able to prove that a transaction is legitimate). This makes is near impossible to cheat the network (counterfeit bitcoin, spending the same bitcoin in two places, etc.), and we can have full trust that the transactions appearing on the blockchain are legitimate.

Finally, the whole network is decentralized. There are no banks or institutions where you have to give them your money and just trust that they will protect it. No banking fees, no waiting days for transactions to clear. All it costs is a small fee on every transaction so that the miners can be rewarded for their work (the fee right now is actually relatively high due to growing pains in the network, but in the future the fee should be negligible with every transaction).

From an economics perspective, you may want to read into deflationary (bitcoin) vs inflationary (dollar) currencies. 

So the 'purpose' of bitcoin is simply applying technological advancement to the monetary system in the form of decentralization and distributed computing. And we are still just talking about bitcoin, not any of the other crypto assets created to employ blockchain, decentralization, distributed computing, to transform other industries and sectors.

"> So if there are more people selling than buying, people will probably reduce the price a bit to sell faster. And if there are more people buying, prices will rise because there's a limited supply. There is a limit to the total amount of bitcoins that will exist and bitcoins are put into circulation by mining - this limited total means that there will be gradually more demand than supply, bringing up the value.

"**Pyramid scheme**

A pyramid scheme (commonly known as pyramid scams) is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

Pyramid schemes have existed for at least a century in different guises. Most multi-level marketing plans fall into a sub-group of pyramid schemes.

"If you read my comment correctly you'd see in the middle of it I mentioned that I'm just gonna have to start buying BTC. 

The reason I ask about new/upcoming altcoins is cause I always enjoyed following others from the beginning, watching the price/communities etc grow and then fail/flourish is a fun process. Plus I feel as I start to invest a more diverse portfolio of coins is a best course of action to take and this is more plausible with beginning altcoins for someone on my current budget. Furthermore, finding something from the start that you believe in and following it throughout its life cycle is more rewarding that just investing in the latest big idea/coin/stock/whatever.

">  I can loan Bitcoin to you

And what would you want for that? Cause I can't pay you interest for it. The Bitcoins I would owe you would increase in value over the time I'm in your debt. Paying interest on top of paying back more Bitcoins than you gave me (well, not more in that sense, but by now Bitcoins will be more expensive and harder for me to get) is pretty hard for anyone who's not, well, printing ~~money~~ bitcoins. So either I don't pay interest in which case I only have to worry about bitcoins becoming more expensive, or I don't take any debts at all. Considering you have no reason to loan me Bitcoins if there's nothing for you to gain from it we would be in a system that's solely build around credit givers and credit takers paying back/asking for their money at the ""right"" time.

Like when there's a huge inflation and people are happy that the debts they used to build a house are now worth as much as a bread.

"That's a rough estimate by taking the current Bitcoin network hashrate and an average hashrate of a CPU/GPU. The estimate is a year or two old so it might have changed by now.
BTW if I was not clear, those estimates are for GPUs and CPUs. Not ASICs.


Bitcoin works by mining blocks which are mathematically dependent on previous blocks and in return of the effort and electricity the miner put in, they get a block reward (current 12.5 BTC, halves every four years. Originally was 50 BTC).

Now, generally no one mines on their individual machines anymore. Even with ASICs mining alone, luck would play a factor and people (miners) generally prefer steadyish income. 

So they mine in what are called pools. Where a large number of miners from all around the world collectively mine and when any one miner from the pool finds a block, the reward is shared by everyone proportionally. That's why it is possible to mine little little Bitcoin. Currently almost all mining is done in pools. 

So the 0.11 BTC/month (although it can never be this precise because network hashrate keeps on changing, mostly increasing thus you get lower and lower payouts as with higher hashrate mining difficulty also increases.) is an estimated pool mining amount.

Honestly, don't worry about mining too much unless you have extremely cheap electricity and want to mine or are just interested. End user does not really need to care that much about this really.

I have massively oversimplified a lot of stuff like transaction fees, difficulty, hashing etc. Try finding some videos on YouTube. They will help if you are really interested in the internals.

"> You're an idyllic zealot who doesn't understand the enormous risk in investing in a currency with literally no grounding in any real world commodity.

And you are an uneducated dunning-kruger pontificating about things you can barely grasp.

Do you not understand how bitcoin's security mechanism works? It works through [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) which is a system that burns electricity to prove work completed, analogous to the labor that people must put into physically extracting gold. You can think of PoW in bitcoin almost as a ""Proof of Joules spent"".

Since electricity is an [energy commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), I think its rather ignorant to claim bitcoin has ""literally no grounding in a real world commodity"".

What gives bitcoin value is its fundamental properties. Just like the fundamental properties of gold, bitcoin too has fundamental properties in which we assign value to.

Those properties include -

Censorship Resistance, Scarcity, Durability, Portability, Fungibility (fraud prevention mechanism) and security (PoW/ Proof of Joules).

The fraud prevention mechanism, security, censorship resistance fungibility values are all inherently linked to Bitcoin's security mechanism, PoW. Without this decentralized security mechanism bitcoin is worthless. It would be trivial to attack to the network and change rules and inflate supply, etc.

>It's value is 100% based on people willing to pretend it has value.

This seems like an argument of which the sole purpose is to muddy the water and provide no substance to the debate. All money of all types is all inherently assigned value because we ""pretend"" it has value. Have you not taken econ101? This is a basic fact that most people out of highschool learn about our monetary system. Its a faith-based system.

I forget the name/details of this story, but it was about a gold vault on an island which suffered a sink hole below the vault. Everyone relied upon believing that their money was backed by gold and that the gold was secure in the vault. After the sinkhole, nothing changed because it was kept secret and society continued to operate as it was because of the faith people had the gold was there.

What is FIAT other than printed paper backed by no real world commodity? Yet the majority of the world operates on this monetary policy. 

>The second a better cryptocurrency comes along, a major bug is discovered, or people simply stop wanting to buy it, it's value will drop to nothing.

Then why do we have literally thousands of cryptocurrencies all retaining value? Your opinion is not backed by any real world data. There is good/sound money, and then there is not sound money. Just because most of these altcoins are not sound money does not mean they wont retain value. 

>And for the record, you don't know anything about me. I didn't panic sell like you assumed.

">You think this is about making more fiat. It's not. It's about freedom from fiat; never having to use fiat again

You don't spend Bitcoin, you hoard it. Why? because it's value is rising. People don't spend or use something when it's value is rising (significantly faster than the inflation rate)

It's volatile, risky, unstable. It's value is derived from ""Wild West"" markets where insider trading, collusion, market manipulation, etc are not only common, but not illegal (this is why we can see huge swings, e.g. 40% in 24 hours)

No stability mechanisms, no regulation, no protection whatsoever

It's technically complex, all risk is personal (one mistake and it's gone), no insurance, no recourse. You can't use it if no internet, no electriticy. It can't be used physically (large portions of third world countries can forget about it)

People we elect would have absolutely no common sense basic monetary or fiscal controls to curb e.g. inflation. Couldn't mitigate a crisis or crash. 

Cryptos themselves are susceptible to forks, hacks, bugs, etc. We don't know what's going to happen in a month, let alone a year. How could pensions, savings, mortgages, business debt, government bonds be organised under such conditions

The motto in basically every crypto forum is ""don't put in more than you can lose""

On the flipside - I can pay for anything in seconds (chip/pin, debit/credit, etc), it's accepted everywhere, it's insured, there is recourse, my deposits are insured (by an independently externally rated third party), I can earn interest on holdings. It's stable, low-risk, low on volatility. I've spent less in bank fees in 3 years than I have in crypto transfer fees in 3 months.

I can use it physically, in any conditions. My pension can be calculated, mortgage, savings, investments, etc.

Despite certain drawbacks (e.g. slow bank to bank money transfers) in terms of sheer practicality and common sense, one functions as a national currency - the other doesn't even come close

The only retort to this I've ever seen anyone attempt is the ""future argument"". That somehow in the future it will ""work itself out"". Unless it's properties change *dramatically* then it will retain the same negatives as it has now - that's just logic

As it currently stands, Bitcoin is an excellent (if risky) highly speculative commodity, aka digital gold. It's an excellent form of ""money"" for black market uses. However it's a dreadful currency (which is why retailers accepting BTC have been decreasing)

>Investment is not greed.

Personally I've gotten quite a few people into crypto over the last 4 years. At no point in that equation is anyone in it to make less fiat. They are there to make more fiat - end of story.

"You're not alone. I've only recently invested (1 month ago) and I'm trying to figure out where the truth is in all this.

Personally I have read so many arguments from both sides and it's hard to tell what's factual and what isn't.

When I first heard of the fork it seemed to be about whether or not the change is good to apply right now. The fork will come with a block size that is twice as large as the current block size (hence 2x vs 1x). Many concede that this change will be necessary but is bad right now for one reason or another.

Both sides seem to agree that a majority of mining power says they support s2x. Some would say that that means that s2x will be more widely accepted despite the bitfinex futures being valued around 1/5 of current btc. Others maintain that miners will follow the money no matter what and thus the futures value matters more than what the miners report. Personally I'm not sure. Why couldn't a miner consider mining for the s2x chain as an investment? We already know they're investors since they needed to get hardware to have any relevant hashing power these days.

My assumption would be that if most miners actually choose 2x then 1x will slow down considerably and values would change accordingly. If someone could give a reason why miners following where the money is implies mining for 1x only, that would be nice.";1;1;False;throwaway12343234321;do9j53q;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

">some people seem to think it’s good, others don’t

I’ll try and be as neutral as possible, while still trying to make it understandable.

The fork will basically cause there to be two Bitcoins (three if you count the already existing Bitcoin Cash, but that’s another story).

Bitcoin Core, and Bitcoin 2X (also known as Segwit2X).

Bitcoin Core follows the current Bitcoin Core developers roadmap. The core developers believe that we don’t need to increase the block size, and that Bitcoin can scale with other optimization (Segwit, which makes “Witness” data not count towards the 1Mb block size) and off-chain technologies (Such as the Lightning network). 

They believe that increasing the blocksize will make it harder for people to run a node and contribute to the network, (As it will increase storage and bandwidth used), and could lead to further centralization.

Bitcoin 2X believes that increasing the block size was always intended, and that Bitcoin transactions should remain on-chain. (The current 1Mb limit was initially created as an anti-spam measure by Satoshi. The argument here is that it was intended to be temporary, and either be removed or increased as needed).

They believe that the increased storage and bandwidth usage will not affect most users, and is being exaggerated.


Both groups believe they are the “True Bitcoin”. But as Bitcoin isn’t owned by anyone, it’s a bit of a grey area.  Some will say “whichever chain has the most work” , or “largest hashrate”, or “most users”, etc, is the True Bitcoin. But again, it’s all subjective.

The other thing is a lack of Replay Protection.(unless this has changed, I’ve been away for a while)
No Replay Protection means if you make a transaction on one chain after the split, your transaction could also be sent on the other chain. So if you send someone 1 “Core” coin, you’ve also sent them a “2X” coin. People believe that this is dangerous, and could cause uninformed people to lose funds by unintentionally sending both coins, instead of just the one they intended.

"**Proof-of-work system**

A proof-of-work (POW) system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. The concept may have been first presented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in a 1993 journal article. The term ""Proof of Work"" or POW was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels.An early example of the proof-of-work system used to give value to a currency is the Shell Money of the Solomon Islands.

A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider.

***

**Commodity**

In economics, a commodity is a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs. Often the item is fungible. Economic commodities comprise goods and services.

Which gpu's? We use a mix of GTX 1070s and 1080ti's. We had a bitch of the time getting the 1070s in this current market. Luckily we got some at like $400. It's becoming increasingly hard for the GPU's though, even for mining the shitcoins and getting paid in Bitcoin. This is why we are phasing out our shit for ASIC miners. Seeing as you dont pay electric, lets just say this, you will profit a TON. If you are renting or something, they will notice. Our electric bill is around $500 - $650 and we are still trying to cut down on that. We are learning as we go and now we are trying to cool the room better. If we have full ASICs cooling would be easier to maintain considering you could just pipe the exhaust out the window. ;0;1;False;ducksauce88;do9zup5;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

"**Ponzi scheme**

A Ponzi scheme (; also a Ponzi game) is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading. Operators of Ponzi schemes can be either individuals or corporations, and grab the attention of new investors by offering short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent.

Companies that engage in Ponzi schemes focus all of their energy into attracting new clients to make investments. Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to older investors.

"If you knew anything about cryptos, you'd know that's not true. What are you even suggesting by saying ""cryptocurrency is just a name behind the same shit system that we have now""?

It's not the same system as we have now with fiat currencies and never will be. Bitcoin and cryptos aren't controlled by big corporations or governments, but they wont suddenly change who has money and who doesn't. It's not a separate world of value where big bad business can't join.

**However, cryptos and blockchain will likely change the world a whole lot from how we know it.** One business in particular, namely banks, will have to adapt. Just think about how you can transfer money to people in other countries. Current systems force you to send through a bank, that has deals with other banks and so on, all the way to you recipient's bank. All of those banks get paid. Bitcoin is just adress to adress no matter where in the world. You also don't need a bank to safely store you money anymore.

Sure, a lot of businesses will join the world of cryptos and will make a profit, some already established and a lot of new start ups. The point im trying to make is that cryptos is not anti capitalism or whatever you're talking about, but it will make our society more efficient and force a lot of corporations to change or die.

If you think our current system is shit (I agree) and care about it, then I suggest you read up on Ethereum. It's the second biggest crypto and it's unlike bitcoin not just a different kind of money.

 [*""How do Bitcoins have value?""*](https://www.quora.com/How-do-Bitcoins-have-value/answer/David-Strayhorn)




Bitcoin is becoming more and more practical by the week, like for worldwide cheap and fast money transfers (remittances) to 3rd world underbanked Countries. Email in the 90's: ""It needs to be easier to send"", or Internet then also: ""It needs to be easier to use"". Bitcoin is just beginning but it will have a huge impact, I think the future economy will be digital and decentralized.

Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.


**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**

* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent.


* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)

* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)

* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)

* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿

*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

It was never high risk to those of us who understand the technology. Also, there are mechanisms in place to allow Bitcoin to deal with bugs.

One time a dude magically created 92 million BTC.

All bugs will provide is buying opportunity. While fool's like yourself panic sell.

EDIT - I get some people might take my high risk comment out of context. Important to the context was ""those of us who understand the technology"". To me, as in the way I view it *from a personal perspective*, is that there is incredibly high value within the bitcoin network and its not nearly as a high-risk investment *to me* than it is to others who do not understand it.

If you do not understand something you should **not** be investing money into it. But the more you understand about bitcoin, the more you realize its much less risky of an investment as we once thought it was. You can go through my history (difficult, I know), and you can find me stating directly without misinterpretation that bitcoin ""is a high risk investment"". 

But my position has evolved over the years. Bitcoin is no longer that crazy outer-world investment it once was. Is it still high risk? *Maybe*. I think its a relevant question that has enormous context. But as time goes on, it appears the risk is reducing. The system continues to show incredible resilience to external attacks of all types and billion dollar hedge funds are now entering the fray. National banks are investigating bitcoin as world reserve currencies and banks around the world are looking into the technology to decrease disintermediation. I would say all in all the future is extremely bright for *bitcoin*.

"Stealing sticked comment to paste warning about counterfeit-Bitcoin, like ""Bitcoin B2X"" and ""Bitcoin BCH"" that uses same address format ""1..."" and that many businesses are trying to sell as ""the Bitcoin"", but it is totally incompatible other coin, with much lower value.

---

***TL;DR:***

/r/all - be aware:

* Bitcoin - Bitcoin Core - Bitcoin SegWit - BTC - BT1 - is the real one worth over 5200$, homepage: https://bitcoin.org ; home sub /r/bitcoin

* Bitcoin Cash - BCash - BCH - BCC - is the first fake Bitcoin.  below 7% of value of Bitcoin. Home subreddit r_btc , home page: bitcoin dot **com** (instead .org) - run by same guy Roger Ver.

* Bitcoin Segwit2X (with the 2X part) - B2X - BT2 - is the second fake Bitcoin. Below 25% of value of Bitcoin.

(**BCC** is also a name of unrelated, real, established, 6 month older altcoin: ""**BitConnect**"", but BitcoinCash stole its ticket name and also tries to use ""BCC"" though community seen through this phishing attempt and names BitcoinCash as ""BCH"" instead; Yes, conman Roger Ver running sub r_btc and bitcoin dot com also supports this phishing and supported name ""BCC"")

---

***the real Bitcoin is for clarity named ""Bitcoin Core""*** and is the one that has wallet ""Bitcoin Core"", it's homepage is as always https://bitcoin.org . Do **not buy fake Bitcoin** that is ""Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Bitcoin Segwit2X"" (or ""Bitcoin Gold"") by mistake!

Also watch out for **phishing sub-reddit** ""btc"" run by known conman Roger Ver (Bitcoin Judas) as a way to promote his bitcoin dot com website and the fake-bitcoin (he is co-creator of one of the fakes, the Bitcoin Cash), where they constantly push propaganda and lies about ""SegWit"" technology (part of Bitcoin).

---

### 1) There is now counterfeit fake-Bitcoin, called ""Bitcoin Cash"" (Bcash, BCH, BCC)

BCH is not BTC. It has over [10 times lower value](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-BCC), and keeps falling since it's ""creation"".

It's a mostly dysfunctional currency, that can not even produce blocks in reliable manner and fails every few days where entire networks hangs for few hours for half day - look http://fork.lol/pow/speed (the speed should be smooth line, best around 1.0).

### 2) Also there is another counterfeit coin that tries to name itself ""Bitcoin"" - the B2X (or ""Bitcoin Segwit2x"")

That B2X is completely different and incompatible with real Bitcoin Segwit. (""Bitcoin"" now includes technology called ""SegWit"", and the fake coin is named ""Bitcoin Segwit2x"" or ""Segwit2x"" or ""B2X"").

Many large popular exchanges will start selling you fake-Bitcoin ""Segwit2X"" under name ""Bitcoin"" ! Read the warnings on https://bitcoin.org/

B2X is also failing, it's evaluated at below 25% price / support of real Bitcoin right now - https://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/bt2btc

**Do not get conned.**

### 3) There is one more fake-Bitcoin coming up, called ""Bitcoin Gold"". But everyone ignores it anyway.

So be careful, ask around.

Ask if you are buying the real Bitcoin, or full name ""Bitcoin Core"" (see http://bitcoin.org - the homepage of Bitcoin).

Always get few sources of information, e.g. phishing subreddit r / btc - is writting and hosting every day on home page obvious lies to discredit ""Bitcoin"", they even say Bitcoin doesn't check digital signatures and that anyone can steal anyone's money, lol.

They post this lies in order to promote ""Bitcoin Cash"" altcoin (and try to call it ""Bitcoin"" to confuse new users).

Well, some users might be even there genuine users, who got conned by others, are conspiracy nuts, or are simply jealous of Bitcoin / Bitcoin Core developers success and want to replace them with own self.

So I finally said fuck it and basically threw all my savings (that I can afford to lose) into it a couple of months back. Well my savings are worth 8% more now and I know it will only go up from here.

And if you're still afraid to get into it, here's another advice. BTC fork is coming up in less than a month and there will probably be a decent dip in price when that happens.

"/r/all - be aware:

### There is now counterfeit fake-Bitcoin, called ""Bitcoin Cash"" (Bcash, BCH)

BCH is not BTC. It has over 10 times lower value, and keeps falling since it's ""creation"".

It's a mostly dysfunctional currency, that can not even produce blocks in reliable manner and fails every few days where entire networks hangs for few hours for half day - look http://fork.lol/pow/speed (the speed should be smooth line, best around 1.0).

### Also there is another counterfeit coin that tries to name itself ""Bitcoin"" - the B2X (or ""Bitcoin Segwit2x"")

That B2X is completely different and incompatible with real Bitcoin Segwit. (""Bitcoin"" now includes technology called ""SegWit"", and the fake coin is named ""Bitcoin Segwit2x"" or ""Segwit2x"" or ""B2X"").

Many large popular exchanges will start selling you fake-Bitcoin ""Segwit2X"" under name ""Bitcoin"" ! Read the warnings on https://bitcoin.org/

B2X is also failing, it's evaluated at below 25% price / support of real Bitcoin right now - https://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/bt2btc

Do not get conned.

There is one more fake-Bitcoin coming up, called ""Bitcoin Gold"".

So be careful, ask around.

Ask if you are buying the real Bitcoin, or full name ""Bitcoin Core"" (see http://bitcoin.org - the homepage of Bitcoin).

"Since this is on /r/all and there are going to be those wondering why Bitcoin is rallying, here is the reason.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/75wh5b/block_489492_f2pool_doesnt_signal_nya_anymore/

Bitcoin has been facing a potential split of its both Technical and economic resources as a portion of the economy wants to upgrade the protocol to increase the block size beyond what was just increased 6 weeks ago with the activation of segwit. These supporters are called Segwit2x, S2X, B2X, NYA signatories, etc. They are mostly miners and subsidiaries of Barry Silberts DCG corporation. The only single Bitcoin developer that supports B2X is Jeff Garzik, while 99.9% of Bitcoin experts have taken a public stance against it.

F2POOL had previously announced that they would not be forced to mine the b2x chain but they had continued to Signal the Nya flag while mining their blocks, which is a way for miners to Signal preference to specific upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol. This led to some confusion as to whether this pool would actually abandoned the agreement or not. F2POOL is a major pool with around 10-12% of the hashrate.

This change of signaling combined with the fact that the b2x token is trading at less than one-fifth of the value of a single Bitcoin spells Doom for this particular attempt at forcing a split upon Bitcoin.
Futures Market for B2X token, currently at 18% of btc -
https://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/bt2btc

The reason the market is rallying is because there are increasingly significant indicators that the agreement is falling apart and Bitcoin not splitting is good for Bitcoin. It also demonstrates how resilient both the market and the technology is at rebounding attacks against its infrastructure. This particular attempt at hijacking Bitcoins consensus process demonstrates how resilient Bitcoin is against corporate interest attempting to use influence power and money to force invalid rule changes upon the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Honest question, because I'm not in the know about BTC at all. I heard about it back when it was a thing people were really only talking about on 4chan so it's cool to see this growth. But is anyone actually buying? I've never seen someone buy anything with BTC. You can't go and put money down on a house with BTC, so whats up? Are there aggregation websites that are the sole traders of BTC where you convert your BTC to real tangible money? And if that's the case, doesn't that kind of bring up an issue for a huge crash because it would literaly be a couple small websites that own a majority of the wealth and dictate how BTC is spent?;2;3;False;Yuskia;doa8nsq;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

"Read the first one or two chapters if you want to gain an intuition on how bitcoin works: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook

Cryptocurrency won't crash and burn. Price will continue to fluctuate with heavy volatility but that's due to market manipulation and big money trying to milk the early days of crypto for all it's worth.

It's possible in the future that bitcoin could lose popularity and its value could crash, but this would be caused by political or technological issues with the project, resulting in money leaving bitcoin and flowing into another cryptocurrency that's ready to take its place. At that point we would all have fair warning and ample time to exchange our bitcoin for the new bitcoin-replacement coin. Though I'm still betting on BTC being the big dog for years to come.

Once you wrap your head around the blockchain data-structure and the implications of a fully distributed and decentralized network, then you can see how bitcoin is simply technological progression applied to a monetary system. If you believe that progress is inevitable, then you shouldn't be worried about the high volatility. These are still early days and the difference between buying a coin at $3000 or $5000 will likely be negligible in the distant future.";1;1;False;yobogoya_;do9w54r;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

"In addition to what others have already said, valuation metrics for Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are structured differently than for stocks since there is no underlying company that can be valued. So analysts have started using what they call an NVT ratio (Network Value to Transactions Ratio) to determine whether or not a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued, and also whether or not the cryptocurrency is approaching bubble territory or not. A cryptocurrency's inherent value is mostly tied to the size of its network and its liquidity. Its value is actually not necessarily in the underlying technology (blockchain etc...) since the technology is open source and has no copyright or patent protection.

"There are cryptocurrency exchanges that allow people to buy and sell their coins at whatever value they choose. So if there are more people selling than buying, people will probably reduce the price a bit to sell faster. And if there are more people buying, prices will rise because there's a limited supply. There is a limit to the total amount of bitcoins that will exist and bitcoins are put into circulation by mining - this limited total means that there will be gradually more demand than supply, bringing up the value.

As to why people are attaching any value at all to bitcoin, it's because it is a technology able to disrupt and potentially fix what many see as a broken financial system in a transparent, decentralised way that no one person controls. And of course there is the mass speculation of the value: people see it is worth a lot and buy, and sell when it starts crashing - which is one of many reasons why it is currently particularly unstable!

"I am not an avg miner, but it goes like this:

Bitcoin miners solve calculations, and by doing so are rewarded with bitcoin. If a lot of people do it, the payout is very low (a $500 dollar miner gives 0.12 bitcoin A MONTH), so it gives you small amounts of money as rewards. 0.12 bitcoin is a lot because its over 500 dollars with the current bitcoin price.



Now, the mobile version works like this: everytime you open the app, it has a claim button which you can press every 20-40 (usually 30) minutes to give you satoshis. Satoshis are like a smaller valued bitcoin, like cents in dollars (fixed, ty /u/skalpelis)(According to another mining app, 100,000,000 satoshi is 1 bitcoin). Every time you claim satoshi, u see an ad. 

The creators are rewarded much more than you are tho. (Every ad = (lets say) 0.1€ to the creator, but you are given 0.01 of it). Now, when you get to your withdrawal amount(10,000-20,000),(the creators already got like 50$ from u, you get your small amount of bitcoin(yaaay)

The main drivers are trust and expectancy-of-future-value. 

The trust thing is the same as you trust you normal money (called fiat money also). You trust a dollar is worth almost the same tomorrow - so you ""know"" you can keep it and use it later also. BitCoin-owners trust a BitCoin will be worth something tomorow too.

The future-value is much much harder to explain. Some of us tech-nerds see all sorts of possible uses in the future. The main use case (meaning normal use) would be to buy a car or your home using BitCoin. 

Last but not least: BitCoin puts your money in YOUR control. No central bank can mess up your country's finances and devalue your fiat money - at your cost. No banks or credit cards can charge you fees for using BitCoin. No government can tax you if a friend sends you BitCoin (because they do not know you received it, they can only see an address on the Blockchain got it). etc etc

"Yes. Massive deflation against the dollar  would be terrible for an actual currency and any economy with goods or contracts priced in that currency. With enormous value swings it'll be impossible to maintain any long term contract priced in a given currency. Mortgages, car loans, even rental agreements would be subject to widely shifting values in the currency market. Deflation also tends to encourage hoarding. People don't spend their bitcoin because they view it as potentially having more value the next day. If banks operated on bitcoin they might have the same attitude towards new loans. Why risk a new loan when they can just sit on their assets and make 10% in a few weeks? 

It'll never be a real currency with enormous shifts in value. No one will trust it with their retirement savings. No country will hold bitcoin reserves or peg their own currency to bitcoin. It'll never serve as a currency of last resort in places where central banking has broken down. As soon as the bottom really falls out of the market a lot of people will lose a lot of money. The trend recently has been deflationary (largely due to hoarding, very little bitcoin is actually used in transactions.) If there is a long term inflationary shift there will be no way to slow it down. If bitcoin consistently loses its value or confidence is suddenly shaken then millions of these people's ""investments"" will evaporate in seconds.

"If bitcoin replaced Visa as the largest payment processor, and we somehow forced all transactions to be overnight (so there's a simple Vol/BTC valuation), BTC is already massively overvalued as a payment processor. And those are two somewhat absurd assumptions in favor of BTC payment.

Does this mean for certain that BTC is overvalued? No. For example, it could replace (be replacing) pallets of 100$ bills as the preferred store of value for warlords everywhere. More optimisticly, some nation could pull an Ecuador, decide they're incompetent to conduct central banking, and somehow integrate BTC. In between those two, countries under heavy sanctions could use it, or it's possible that there's something missing on the payment processing story I told earlier, like the size of the global black market, or needs for money laundering actually being more constraining than 1btc per day.

Great comparison is the web in 1994.  Many said what a waste, what's it good for, to chat with random people and a boob after 3mins of download time?  No thank you.   No one knew about smart phones. High speed internet.  About YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.   But intelligent people knew the web was gonna be huge and the future.  No one know which apps would take us there but we knew it was coming.  

The dot com crash did happen in last 90s and we will crash too.  But not before we run this up much much higher. Bitcoin will goto $100,000 and then drop to 25k in the crash.  That's our future.  

Not to mention the good we're doing and the evil we're fighting.  ";2;1;False;Pink-Fish;do9worr;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

That, from my point of view, is one of the problems cryptocurrencies have to overcome in order to work more as a currency and less as an investment.

Besides, if an investment is only rewarding you 6% in a 5% inflation environment, it’s probably risk free (only awarding you for the time value of your money).

1. Community finds out about a looming fork. 

2. A lot of money gets drained from the alt market and dumped into btc. Most people want free money they get from the fork. [I like money!](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a0/13/3a/a0133af6df8488abcb3bd3f0c2efd08e--best-quotes-movie-quotes.jpg). Specially whales. 

3. This sharply increases the price of bitcoin and depresses the alt market. It sets a new low support for the BTC price. maybe 10, 15% higher. 

4. Fork happens. Savvy investors/whales are the first to dump their shiny new fake BTC coins. They either buy Alts, or they buy BTC, which increases the price of the alt market and [drops the price of the new BTC-copy-Goat-Shitcoin](https://imgur.com/a/J3DCs)

5. Then the pump begins. [The attackers start pumping their shitcoin](https://imgur.com/a/VkeTI), but that only has a short fix as [more and more people start dumping their faux BTC](https://imgur.com/a/NuNy0). 

6. Rinse repeat. 

They way I see it is that each fork attack, brings capital in from the attackers and distributes it between the BTC and the ALT market in the long run and makes both stronger as a result. This will have less and less of an effect as each time it happens it reaffirms to the community which chain is the true bitcoin and which chain is copy cat fake. Micky Mouse mate.

"To make trillion mark notes? The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks, about 442 billion dollars in today's money. Between the treaty and the blockade about 800,000 people were starved to death or were preyed upon by people starved out of their minds and the economy was utterly ruined for a period of time. But changes were enacted to national policy and the economy sprang back to the point that it was clear to rival other powers in Europe and abroad.

"Your trillion bill should remind you of the reason why Bitcoin is failing as a currency:

The two most important things people need to use a currency is acceptability and stability.  Bitcoin is not accepted as form of payment in many places and the reason is stability.  As a currency, no one wants to use a currency that is $2500 one month, $5000 next month, and $3000 the next - just as people stuck with Zimbabwean dollar didn't want it because uncertainty was too high.

So it is ironic that you you think of Zimbabwe as a reason for Bitcoin when Bitcoin is all over the place and pretty much unusable as a currency for normal people.  In the end, Zimbabwean dollar is history and you probably know what it was replaced by, right?

This rampant speculation and shilling is what hurts Bitcoin.  It's not a sign of ""success.""

"Nope.

Nobody fucked up.

It was quite deliberately well thought out and executed.

Quite smart, but rather twisted.

A good long time ago, the Brits came along and stole the whole bloody country at the point of a gun.

And then enacted a metric shit tonne of laws about property ownership etc. etc. then some how ended up with more and more land and property ending up in british hands.

And then old Smithy came along and enacted another shit tonne of laws around currency control so you couldn't take your money out of Zim.

So then Mugs comes along and wants to steal the country back.

Now he's no Robin Hood.

He wants to steal it for himself and his close buddies. (Just because you're a black Zimbabwean, doesn't mean Mugs likes you.)

So he runs the printing presses hot paying his buddies fabulous salaries...

...which means they are Rich and can buy things (you know, that oh so British thing of Property Rights?)

But relative to the rest of the world the Zim dollar begins to lose it's value....


..but remember Smithy's currency control laws?

Yup, you can't convert your Zim dollars into anything else.

So everybody else's bank balance vanishes whilst Mugses buddies steal an entire country and drain everyone elses bank balance.

All using British and Colonial era laws and mechanisms.

"This is one time it isn't reaaaally the banks' fault. Zimbabwe used to be known as ""the breadbasket of Africa"" and was doing pretty solid. Then post-1980-independence president Robert fking Gabriel Mugabe (who is still in power) made a bunch of shitty decisions because he didn't want to give up power, was corrupt, and wanted to make his friends richer. 

He took successful farms away from white Zimbabweans and gave them to black Zimbabweans. Okay idea in theory ""for justice"", although so fked up to the families who were often given a week to pack up and leave a piece of land that their family had worked to run. But, did he give them to people who knew how to run farms? Nope. Zimbabwe is a huge agricultural economy. That quickly started tanking. 

Price of bread starts to rise. What does he do? Put's a cap on the price of bread. Did he put a cap on the price of wheat? Nope. 

Well at least we have our precious minerals that we can mine!! Nope, sold mines to China for airplanes. 

These are just a few, and definitely not the most fucked up, things Mugabe did that caused Zim economy to tank, and inflation to go wild. Banks failed in that people who were putting their savings in banks essentially lost it all - they couldn't withdraw it because of a cash shortage, or even if they could it just wasn't worth anything due to inflation. 

Carry that to remind yourself that you have the privilege of worrying about the banking system.

"It's a similar struggle seen when any country gained their independence in Africa (and elsewhere). They've only seen rule by colonization as their example.

"The parent mentioned [**Central Bank**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Central_Bank). For anyone unfamiliar with this term, **here is the definition:**^\(In ^beta, ^be ^kind)
****
A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and usually also prints the national currency, which usually serves as the state's legal tender.

"The banking system that has worked for ""thousands of years"" is different to what we employ now. 
Gold standard banking meant that the amount of money one had was directly proportional to what one could afford to buy. 
Abandoning the gold system means that earnings can soar without gaining any value. 
The Gold Standard guaranteed your value, the fiat currency is a façade of no integrity that can be reproduced at will. 

The use of fiat currency has allowed for US financial institutions to sell financial instruments that are worth 500 times more than the nation's GDP.
I can't make a $50 bet that I'll earn $5 - it not logical, and in a closed system of that comprises $10 a $50 bet shouldn't be possible, but it is thanks to the fact that I can print money freely.
