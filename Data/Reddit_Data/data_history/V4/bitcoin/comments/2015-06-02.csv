"> Yet there was no trial for this, no proof, nothing.

The evidence for the 5 murder for hires was presented and they get included with the sentencing consideration for the continuing criminal enterprise charge.

If the defense was able to cast a reasonable doubt on that evidence then it's very likely he would been found not guilty of that specific charge.";1;0;False;notreddingit;crt9egg;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

The government is made up of a lot of people.  I don't think they always say the same things and sometimes they contradict each other.  I say that if all the government says something its pretty likely that's it true.  Of course we should question everything.  Including people like you or me or even Ross Ulbricht.;1;1;False;;crsgowt;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced
