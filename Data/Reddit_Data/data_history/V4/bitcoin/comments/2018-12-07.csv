One question that nobody who puts decentralization above everything else has been able to answer me. To maintain decentralization, you need more people running full nodes. But why would limiting Bitcoin's throughput make more people run nodes?

"Im not saying people initial investments are wrong when they made then. But doubling down on a falling knife is often wrong. Its how people react when reality doesnt go according to expectations. People call themselves long term investors who are not interested in quick cash. Well here we see people buying more when its only $3000 cheaper. Thats nothing in the grand scheme of things if they truly believe bitcoin will take off and go to 200k+.

The truth is they are emotional and not making logical decisions. They do want to make their money back asap. We all feel that way when on a losing trade. My point is there is a risk to buying.

"That's its cost.  Its value is something else.

You could assign value according to its inherent utility.  Which, TBH is pretty low at the moment.  The other way to assign value is via market demand, which in a rational world should be directly correlated with utility.

Previously, demand for BTC was irrationally in excess of its actual utility.  It is becoming more rational, but I don't think it's quite there yet.";1;0;False;Not_Stupid;ebba2i9;Embarrassed being caught in the middle;a3vodm;https://i.redd.it/99vtfrbutr221.jpg
"The costs associated with creating a bitcoin are not a measure of intrinsic value. Production costs can affect extrinsic value, but only in relation to demand. If it costs $100 to create a useless widget, the value of that widget is $0.

*Intrinsic* value is what you have when you strip away what gives something *extrinsic* value, like supply and demand.

Take gold for example. The price of gold is high because lots of people want it and it's hard to get more of it. There are many people who buy gold simply because it's valuable (similar to Bitcoin). But if gold were plentiful and cheap would it still have intrinsic value? Yes, because people also desire gold for its intrinsic properties like malleability, resistance to corrosion, and its usefulness in manufacturing and creating jewelry. Those things have nothing to do with how much it costs to mine gold.

Now what about Bitcoin? Its only intrinsic value is its usefulness as a medium of exchange. But compared to other options such as the USD, Bitcoin's utility falls far short.";1;0;False;deuteros;ebav0rc;Embarrassed being caught in the middle;a3vodm;https://i.redd.it/99vtfrbutr221.jpg

"uhh.. I think the reason you could buy bitcoin cheaper years ago was because BTC had not yet appreciated in value to ridiculous levels.. not because of rapid inflation of the USD. 

Also, all you have to do to keep your buyer's power year over year is invest it in a product (alternative investment - e.g. a REIT) that keeps up with or beats inflation (Currently 2.2% if you look at the CPI). If I can buy more things with my USD than I could last year because I put it in something that grew it's value at a steady rate, I'd call that an appreciating asset, not a depreciating one. You are nuts man.

The USD is not plummeting. I'm not sure where you got that information.

Last I checked, it was BTC where people have the largest unrealized losses, and they get very angry about it, saying ""Last chance to get on before we rocket to 100k, bankers are forcing panic selling, hodl, etc."" and yet here it is now, still falling.

The Indians can still do things for you in a decentralized world. The job those Indians would be doing just does not exist yet. From a technological point of view, maintaining centralization is illogical. Mankind currently has the problem that we are far too greedy and untrustworthy when it comes to distribution of large quantities of wealth. Centralization enables this behaviour as we tend to be a species that will exploit anything we possibly can for personal gain. A decentralized system of exchange, on the other hand, does not prevent greed or make Human's better people, instead it systemically removes the ability to abuse the system the way it is possible in a centralized environment. In other words, decentralization allows for a more fair system of exchange that cannot be tampered with.

It shouldn’t have to be about ‘catching a falling knife’ or an ‘attempt to make money back’. Before anybody put money into any type of investment, there should be clear expectations of when they expect to make their ROI - based any decision thereafter accordingly to that plan.

"And at least in Apples case, they have an unusually large cash hoard, which amounts to something like $50 USD per share, so that's the bare minimum that it should go for.  And of course investors consider the rest of the company to have value so it goes for a lot more than that per share.

The major Fortune 500 blue chip companies generate money, so their value isn't just plucked out of thin air by what speculators feel like paying.  For growth stocks rather than income stocks, it's quite a bit more speculative and more subjective in value, but certainly there is a reasonable expectation of tangible dividends in the future.  The stock market isn't just Pokemon cards and Beanie Babies being bought up by enthusiasts.  There is real value underlying them.

One way that there could arguably be real value in Bitcoin rather than just pure tulip mania, it would be if it were a highly efficient currency that caught on as a form of payment.  But backers seem to have abandoned trying to get widespread adoption as a currency.  It's expensive to verify relative to online transfers of conventional government backed currencies, it's volatile, and it's risky for the broader population who aren't tech savvy enough to manage it safely.

"Look, I said I understand it already.  Yes, Bitcoin now has less purchasing power than it did at any point earlier this year and thus the purchasing power of someone holding bitcoin that they traded for (most kinds of) fiat earlier this year has decreased.  I am not disputing any of that.

What I am disputing is that **money** has been lost.  Not value, not purchasing power, money.

Let's go through a hypothetical example.

1. I have $1000 and 0.00BTC.  
The exchange rate is currently $5000/1.0BTC.
2. I trade $500 for 0.10BTC.  
I now have $500 and 0.10BTC.  
I have lost $500.  I have gained 0.10BTC.  
My purchasing power (not money) is $1000 equivalent.
3. The exchange rate changes to $500/1.0BTC.  
I still have $500 and 0.10BTC.  
I have still only lost $500 and still only gained 0.10BTC.  
My purchasing power (not money) is down to $550 equivalent.  
I have therefore lost purchasing power, not money.

"Noticed my account custodian, Fidelity, is planning on offering coin investing opportunities in the near future so I need to set up a strategy for buying BTC/Alts (I currently trade equities, bonds, currency, commodities, and gold). Looking at the price history of GBTC and setting it to my proprietary MACD metric these are my findings:

From 5/2017 to 2/2018 GBTC was in a buy/accumulate stage which meant buying the dips made sense.

From 2/2018 to 8/2018 GBTC was in a hold/liquidate stage which meant selling the rallies made sense.

From 8/2018 to today. Sell and HODL cash, waiting for the price to recover. 

To show you how bad the technical price action for GBTC is, to entice me to buy it would need to break $11 ($11,000 BTC) over the next six months. A hell of a hurdle. Until it reaches $11 I won't touch it with a ten-foot-pole!

My worst case outcome is that in a couple of years with GBTC at $1 it might become a profitable trade for a month or two before rolling toward oblivion.

Remember it never to late to buy when something is going up, and never to late to sell when going down. W. Buffett has two rules: #1 Don't lose money, rule #2 (see rule #1).

As someone who likes the idea of crypto and the blockchain in a non-investment way, I don't understand why you would not sell after it lost about 10% of value. You could always buy back in as soon as it moves steadily upwards again. Can anyone explain why you are still holding? Why not cash out and put it savings until it's clear there is a pick up in fortunes? Is it that expensive to buy and sell? Do you hodl out of a sense of loyalty?;1;1;False;aledlewis;eba4uir;Embarrassed being caught in the middle;a3vodm;https://i.redd.it/99vtfrbutr221.jpg

Why don't you fucking use your Bitcoin into something useful instead of waiting to sell for stupid fiat? If you want money go make it, stop waiting for crypto to get you richer, it won't happen with that mindset.

"HOW TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY SELL BTC, AND BE MENTALLY RIGHT WITH YOURSELF...

\#1. Bitcoin, among all the coins, is the only one patterned after gold.

\#2. Libertarians love bitcoin, and also gold.

\#3. Consider bitcoin to be a smart phone, and gold to be a landline rotary (like your gramps...me, use to use).

\#4. Under certain conditions the smart phone will give you better 'reception', the same is true for the landline.

\#5. Trade back and forth between GLD and GBTC (proxy for BTC) going to [stockcharts.com](https://stockcharts.com) and entering GLD:GBTC. What you will see is the price of gold stated in terms of the price of BTC...which has been soaring as BTC has crashed. This means you currently want your money in gold.

\#6. When the blue and red moving averages cross, it's know as a 'death cross' for gold, meaning it's time to switch investments back to BTC.

\#7. This strategy lets you stay true to your Libertarian roots, and also provides a future entry price for BTC !!!

"This is absurd. “Seasoned” investors calmly holding... what’s there to be calm about?

1. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The price is in free fall as the dumb get rich quick investors flee. The only remaining users are tech enthusiasts which was always a minority.

2. The tech is too complex for the average consumer. The simplest methods of buying bitcoin require all sorts of id verification and then there is no consumer protection if a user gets scammed or defrauded.

3. Terrible for the environment. Uses more electricity than entire countries.

4. It’s impractical for everyday use. Transactions can take half an hour to complete.

5. There are 1 million better alternatives for all use cases, including the black market uses that used to be the thing keeping the value up.

However, compared to business transactions it's way faster as it takes days to weeks for cheques etc to clear through the banking system which is archaic.

Do you often have problems with your fiat being “confiscated” or your transactions “blocked?”  Because in 34 years of living I have never had this occur.

 I will concede that, once, my credit card was compromised and transactions were made without my consent.  My bank reversed them within a couple of days and it didn’t cost me a penny.  (Woe betide you if your private key is ever compromised, but just exercise completely perfect security practices and never make a mistake and you’re all set there!)";5;1;False;TobyTheRobot;eb92xf0;Priorities;a3n8qb;https://i.redd.it/fg3727v3an221.jpg
"I guess you lead a more exotic financial life than me, because I've never been flagged for money laundering (in spite of a reasonably good income and a lot of foolish purchases), and if a card gets flagged for a questionable transaction warning the worst I have to do is respond to a text saying ""yes, I attempted that transaction,"" and that's rare.  

In any case, based on all of the stories I read about how bitcoiners encounter difficulties trying to buy a sandwich (""I didn't have a BIP70-compatible wallet so my Bitpay transaction didn't go through!"" or ""I asked to pay with Bitcoin and the one guy who knows how to do the transaction wasn't working that day!""), I mean, let's not draw a false equivalence here.  It's not like the choice is between the fiat system's bullshit and perfection; it's between the fiat system's bullshit and Bitcoin's bullshit.  Neither is seamless, but at least places reliably accept fiat, and the no-hassle success rate appears to be much higher.
