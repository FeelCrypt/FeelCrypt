"I am a Bitcoin fan, and I think the cost the world pays for the Bitcoin blockchain is worth it, but I am also perhaps a rarity in that I also appreciate your thoughts.  Ignore the down votes. 

The problem I see with these ideas is that they have been tried.  Such things exist, and they have failed.  Consider the housing credit crisis.  Many cooperative parties were responsible for keeping the system in check, with a lot to lose long term if it failed.  However, they all took short term gains as more important than the long term risks.   Credit agencies were incentivized to give better than appropriate ratings.  Banks to give too risky loans.  Hedge funds to buy products that gave high returns without really questioning the risks which were advertised to be low. 

The fundamental problem is the people are incentivized to be dishonest.  They get rewarded for it.  Honest people are honest for morality sake.  They lose money by being honest.  At least in the short term.  So corruption will always happen.  Politicians will say there is a conspiracy to alter video or recorded testimony.  Corporations will doctor books.  Consumers will wink, nod, and operate under the table. 

An immutable history is something this world had never seen until Bitcoin.  I don't know how much that will benefit the world, but as one of the honest people, I welcome it. Even at great expense.";1;1;False;Adamsd5;euyd6il;Quick, upvote this to confuse everyone into thinking the price jumped back up.;chbx9d;https://i.redd.it/pcioshemnac31.gif
