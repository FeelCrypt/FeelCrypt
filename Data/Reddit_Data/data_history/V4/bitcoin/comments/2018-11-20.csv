If you're suggesting nothing will change with a drastic reduction in the state, you're essentially saying that people will voluntarily not burn trash in their backyard or commit fraud.

No it doesn't. Just because there's the slightest ""change in magnitude of State influence"" doesn't mean law enforcement is eliminated. Do you know what a small percentage of taxes go toward things like police to prevent/solve thefts, murders, etc? Do you know that there are more private police than public police?

> Your core premise is ""people will get along just fine with less government and all the problems government tries to deal with will go away with less of it. have faith""

Also you're still ignoring the evidence. I guess you're just dismissing anything that doesn't line up with your preconceived notions as 'pseudo-poliscientific fratboy literature from obviously compromised ""think tanks""' but that is not an argument. Just dismissing things that are inconvenient for you doesn't invalidate them.

> No need for speed limits in residential neighborhoods. People will just naturally drive a speed that is safe for them and others anyway.

No, the owners and residential associations can make people drive the speed limit under even the most extreme forms of libertarianism. Even today much of this is done using money gathered privately, and the people voluntarily paying for that are doing so on top of taxes they already pay which don't go to enforce those speed limits. That you think this can't be done is just another example of your ignorance.

> The rest of your rebuttal can essential boiled down to ""I've read a lot of interesting literature from the CATO Institute that my confirmation bias and love of Penn and Teller tells me is irrefutable proof that my faith in vague and dubious concepts of freedom, natural rights, and the voluntarily benevolence of individuals and markets is well-founded""

So in other words, if someone looks at evidence, arguments, facts, and comes up with any conclusion other than yours, you will always dismiss it as 'faith'. Perhaps we should sit in a big room with pews and just listen to you so that we can finally be cleansed of all our faith and instead become scientists.

> If your response to complexity is ""let's just sit back and let nature take it's course. I'm sure everything will be fine, and if it isn't then so be it we'll work it out together"" is cartoonishly suburban kumbaya nonsense. Essentially suggesting volunteer bucket brigades for fires is workable and preferable.

The fact that you think that ""hey, let's work out a solution to fires together"" means ""we'll use a bucket brigade and obviously nothing else,"" is ridiculous. It's contrary to the fact that people have in fact implemented firefighting solutions other than bucket brigades, and even sometimes worked out how to pay for them without taxation. Your position is based on ignorance and flat rejection of reality.

"> 1) Libertarianism is naive and very faith-based, as it presupposes that individuals will voluntarily cooperate, contribute to common problems,

If you're arguing that libertarian policies dismantle the things that cause people to cooperate and so the voluntary interactions we see in daily life would therefore largely cease, that seems like a rather extraordinary claim which would need support. We also have reason to believe that doesn't necessarily happen, [for example][1]. Instead the null hypothesis that human nature doesn't radically change due to a change in magnitude of State influence and so the level voluntary cooperation wouldn't radically change from what is often observed in everyday interactions between private individuals seems quite moderate and reasonable.

On the other hand perhaps you believe that the average, everyday amount of cooperation isn't sufficient for libertarian policies, and instead they can only work when people exercise super-human levels of cooperation. That position also I think would have to be supported, since, unlike some ideologies, libertarianism does not posit any changes to human nature, some kind of libertarian version of the ""new Soviet man,"" and I don't see what in particular would make anyone think such a change in human nature would be required.

> and keep their personal behaviors to themselves and away from impacting others.

That's obviously not something claimed by libertarians, and in fact implicitly rejected by much of what libertarians write. They can't be presupposing that individuals will always keep their personal behaviors from impacting others if they're writing articles about how to address and remedy, in a libertarian way, individuals' behaviors impacting other people. What you've got here is just a caricature of libertarianism.

> The existence of many laws, regulations, or government policies are therefore unnecessary and probably more harmful than just leaving it up to people. With more freedom for individuals, everything will magically become better than it is now.

> 2) Rules make things worse, ergo fewer rules will make things better. Founded upon the flawed process that totalitarian government has been generally bad, and freedom/capitalism has been generally good, ergo more capitalism and freedom and less government will be better. We don't need government anyways because people will voluntarily support and protect the things that government - with all its resources and a monopoly power - cannot seem to adequately support or protect.

> 3) Libertarianism is closer to a religion than it is a real political position, as its very much tied to abstract scripture and faith in a system to provide as long as we believe in it and let it flourish. The preacher says ""if we all love Jesus and believe in God and create a society where these things are paramount, things will become better, safer, and more prosperous"", while the libertarian essentially subs out ""Jesus and God"" for ""freedom and individuality""

See, here you're trying to prove a negative: that there's no actual reasons that libertarians could possibly have come to any of the conclusions that they have. You're just stating a poor caricature of libertarian beliefs, eliding all of the reasoning either because you're unaware of it or pretending it doesn't exist, and then saying, ""See, I didn't describe the reasoning so therefore it doesn't exist, and so libertarianism is all just religion and faith."" But this does not actually succeed at proving the negative.

For example presenting libertarianism as ""The existence of many laws, regulations, or government policies are therefore unnecessary and probably more harmful than just leaving it up to people,"" pretends that libertarians haven't written or even read, good journalism on specific policies showing exactly how and why they are harmful. It just elides all that and replaces it with, ""well, probably all policies do more harm than good."" Or saying ""totalitarian government has been generally bad, and freedom/capitalism has been generally good, ergo more capitalism and freedom and less government will be better,"" pretends things like research on the relationship and causality between economic freedoms and metrics of social wellbeing doesn't exist.

> and certainly overlooks any sort of complexity in the world whatsoever, but faith doesn't care about that.

I find it's quite the opposite: that those who take a Hayekian viewpoint, for example, are far more likely to be sensitive to the fact that the world is a complex place and, for example, isn't always amenable to plans the way supporters of central planning expect, or that things may not work out in unexpected ways.

> Ultimately, it's absolute nonsense to suggest that the way to solve problems that we don't have enough consistent money, coordination, or coherent power to deal with through government will somehow be easily solved by having less government and there less money, less coordination, and less coherent power.

Libertarians don't claim all the solutions are easy (that would be another strawman) but this demonstrates pretty well one common error: the above implies that if some problem hasn't been solved you just need more money (a common refrain for education, no matter how much is already being spent), or you just need better central coordination or more power (because a failing bureaucracy couldn't possibly be due to perverse incentives; i.e. it couldn't possibly be that the agents are all coordinating wonderfully, just not with the goal of achieving what you want). If something isn't working, or isn't working as well as one might want, just doing the same thing but harder, with more money and more power, doesn't necessarily work any better. Sometimes the problem isn't a lack of money or power. Sometimes the world is more complex than that.";1;1;False;bames53;ea2ixll;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

"I think I somewhat agree with what you're saying, but just to play devil's advocate here-

>For Bitcoin to be adopted, merchants need the stability.

Is that necessarily true?  Or would they also maybe settle for an offer they can't refuse. . .such as another major, extended bull-run where they don't want to turn down bitcoin purchases because they know they can at least make some extra profit just by waiting even a little while to trade their coins for fiat, let alone maybe hold some for the long term?

Furthermore, if merchants need the stability in order to accept/adopt the coin, where does that stability come from, if not partly from they themselves taking the risk of accepting bitcoin, even when it's not stable?  Is this not still the catch-22?

>In order for it to be used by buyers, it needs to be accessible and spendable in a matter of minutes, through your mobile phone.

It's been this way for quite some time. . . yet the surge of spending and merchant adoption we saw in 2012/13, quickly evaporated away, even though there was ease of spending and there were tons of merchants who accepted bitcoin (places to spend bitcoin).

"Agreed.

But not because there isn't something of a catch-22 here; there is- most people will not adopt a volatile asset (speculative trading, while important, cannot be considered adoption in the important long-term sense).

The difference is that you are seeing the mechanism behind coordinating against the catch-22 (you say ""greed"" but I would also say that the volatility itself is what coordinates that greed into more real adoption and transaction loops).  You are seeing past the catch-22, which is good, but it's also important to understand the mechanisms of what is happening, and other factors which might be hampering that process and keeping the asset more volatile than it otherwise might be.";2;1;False;kwanijml;ea4jiqi;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/

"How does it store value unless it has utility outside storing value?

Or, who would adopt it as a store of value, if it's volatile? 

From Wikipedia:

>A¬†store of value¬†is the function of an¬†asset¬†that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains¬†purchasing power¬†into the future.

So, while you and I probably have a kind of faith (or let's say, insight) into bitcoin's utility and how bitcoin is likely it is to retain (or grow) it's purchasing power into the future...this is not well understood or agreed upon. Most people will only store value in less volatile (and more tried and true) assets.

So, we still have a catch 22 of sorts here. But the market does have mechanisms by which to coordinate against this:

From a technological standpoint Bitcoin is still in its infancy. It has real, unique, valuable properties you cannot find in any other technology. People invested in Bitcoin for the long term believe those properties are fundamentally important and will remain so in the future.

People have an inaccurate view of how long it takes to bring an actually *new* technology to the mainstream, because they are often misled into thinking incrementally boring steps are revolutionary. And of course, those happen *fast*.

Arpanet was established in 1969. It took 20 years to get to the point of baseline academic internet functionality, and another 15 to get something even moderately resembling the technological wonder we take for granted today.

"> Because Bitcoin lacks what any real currency needs; STABILITY.

If you examine [the history of the U.S. Dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar) (do you consider it a ""real currency""?) you will find it was more volatile during its first decade than BTC even with a government to criminalize competing currencies.

BTC is real money for a change, not IOU tokens issued by a fat kid left in charge of the candy store. That change is more than worth some relatively mild growing pains.

> The most stable currencies in the world are backed by something more than just ""trust"".

Such as bombs and bullets.

Better throw some quotes around ""stable"", too, since:

1. They are only stable between bailouts 
2. It is a *stable* transfer of value from token holders to issuers via inflation.

"That's actually a great point!

The only problem is, if you had invested in Archie in 1991 (Or Bunyip I guess, which was the company), you would now have... well you'd have nothing, because though the technology behind search engines has certainly improved, and they're capable of all sorts of great shit, you weren't invested in ""search engines"", you were invested in a particular company who MADE search engines.

But here's the worse part: even investment in Bunyip would have been better than what we're doing now. Because right now no one is ""investing"" in ANYTHING, they are buying bitcoin itself, not the technology behind it, not a company who makes it, but the product. It would be like if you could invest in Archie only, and even if Bunyip went on to create a new search engine called ""google"", you'd STILL get shit all because all you have is ""stock"" in an old technology.

There are many arguments for why crypto currency will be a thing at some point. If there was investment in a company doing research into crypto, holding patents, whatever the fuck you can say has some revenue potential in the future, then that sounds compelling. Right now the investment is in a single currency.

That being said, I'm more bullish on bitcoin than gold. This stance is completely contingent on bitcoin gaining much more utility than where it is today.

"Please entertain me how transfer 6 million dollar of btc in USD anonymously. Walk me thru the actually step. 

No legitimate exchange will let you do a 6 million dollar transaction without verifying your identity. Actually anytime you do transaction 4 digit and up it get harder and harder to do anonymously. 

Do you would have to find someone underground to do this? I assume this guy would have to bring cash to remain anonymous? You cannot transfer 6 million dollar between bank account without being flagged. If you can there would be no need for all this anyways 

So do you met up with said guy at a back alley. He comes with a 5 tons truck with cash and you show up with your ledger and a computer and you do the transaction this way? How do you pay the goons you will need to count all these cash to make sure the 5 tons trucks is not just holding bunch of toilet with couple stack of cash visible. Oh and what about fake bills? 

How do you ensure these goons that count and transfer your cash also keep your identity anonymous. Don‚Äôt forget the truck driver. There is a lot of people you have to off to keep your anonymous

Where do you keep said cash once you have it? In the wall? You certainly can‚Äôt put that back in the bank. 


So realistically NOBODY transfer btc in the millions into fiat anonymously unless you are a drug dealer. If you are shady character of this magnitude don‚Äôt need help transfering money anonymously.  


If you do have 6 million you would like to move around anonymously and you are not Pablo Escobar 2.0. It is Probabaly better to keep that amount in btc and just convert small amount to cash when necessary. 

This mean you have to trust that your 6 million will still be worth 6 million is years of time and that people are still interested in bitcoin in years of time. 

This is not too different from gold. Gold is pretty anonymous albeit a hard method to store value. But gold has been establish its stability in times of hardship and bonus of it being a recognize of form of asset storage by governmental bodies. 

Bitcoin establish nothing but that it is got violent price movement and bunch of infidel believers that come and goes according to its price swings

"I live in a city with a hot real estate market. I have also seen listing that claim they accept bitcoin. 

Whether anybody actually pay in bitcoin is a mystery. 

Real estate is a very big purchase with much paperwork and paper trail and a lot of associated taxes and fees. 

The only advantage to paying in bitcoin vs fiat is to fly under the radar/ avoid taxes / money laundering. None of that is possible anymore due to tightly regulation. 

There is also multiple parties that needs to be pay in a real estate transaction. ALL party needs to agree to payment in crypto. I simply don‚Äôt see that happen unless this is a private one on one transaction (in a hot market this is very rare). Even on the rare occasion that all the party accept payment in crypto (listing company, the agent and the seller etc) I still don‚Äôt see the government accepting tax and fee payment in crypto. 

There is also the problem of exchange rate. None of the properties accepting bitcoin list their price on bitcoin. The prices are listed in fiat and they will accept the equivalent in btc. 

This is a major problem in using btc for real estate because fund are usually not transfer between parties right away. There is escrow involved during the deal. During this time should the fund be held in btc by the escrow or in fiat? Value of btc could raise or drop significantly during this period which could screw over either party depending on the direction of price change. 

The easy answer would be to hold the fund in fiat right? But not all real estate deals make it to the final step. Sometimes for whatever reason deal is not completed and fund is return to the buyer. Does the buyer get btc back or fiat? He/she might have different answer depending on the amount that has change since the fund was deposited. Who is responsible for the lost on monetary value while this whole fiasco is taking place?

Now let say they deal goes through. How will the governmental body determine the actual price on the property for tax purposes? Say the sale price is agree at 1 million dollar. The equivalent amount of btc is transfer to escrow and kept in btc by the escrow. During the period bitcoin raise by 20%. The buyer just lost 20% on the deal. It gets even more complicated for the seller. The seller gain 20% compare to their agreed price when he convert the btc back to fiat. So is this 20% gain calculated as capital gain? On top of the taxes he has to pay on however much he gain from selling the house? 

What if it‚Äôs the other way around? Btc drops 20%?

Just thinking about all these is enough to give any sane person a headache. There is zero advantage to buying real estate in btc unless you are in a place with loose regulation and you are so crypto rich you whole life is in crypto. I can see a deal like this happening is some Third world country. 

Not anywhere we a sane governmental body. 


This is also why bitcoin will not replace fiat that are issued by a first world country with a stable government.

"Nobody trusts bitcoin as a currency because of its constantly fluctuating value. And the value will keep fluctuating as long as people are afraid to leave their money in bitcoin. It‚Äôs a self-perpetuating cycle and I don‚Äôt see it ending. 

There was a period of time when people were excited to put a small percentage of their money in bitcoin and use it to buy things, when the value was steadily rising. I know there were ups and downs, but the value of a bitcoin was clearly rising month to month for a couple of years. You could buy $100 worth of bitcoin and easily expect to get $120 worth of spending power out of it if you made small transactions over a few months. Nobody cared about transaction fees because that would just come out of that extra $20 you got. 

Then 2017 showed us that bitcoin as a system was unprepared to handle high values and high volume. Transaction fees and delays got ridiculous. People got cold feet (or straight up lost a ton of money when the price crashed) and now it‚Äôs stuck in this hell cycle.

"Spending bitcoin isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcontributing to the bitcoin economy‚Äù if you think mass adoption is everyone spending bitcoin all over the place you are wrong. Spending is the exact same as selling, even worse actually, as you are trading the future monetary standard for what? A bag of Doritos and an iced tea? 

That‚Äôs the entire point of bitcoin. By holding it you are putting faith in the fact that it‚Äôs deflationary and not inflationary like the USD that‚Äôs increased supply by 6.2% this year alone. 

You are taking complete control over your financial goals which involves NOT SPENDING BTC OR $$ on useless shit at all period.

"Simple issue of Privacy vs Secrecy. What do you want? 

Common mistake by the majority of folks that don't really look into the way the current system works. It's outlined simply in the original Cypherpunk Manifesto. 

‚ÄúPrivacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A Private matter is something one doesn‚Äôt want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn‚Äôt want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.‚Äù 

It goes onto give simple examples as well....

‚ÄúWhen I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.‚Äù

"Bitcoin is a modern digital form of money, secured by cryptography and implemented in a trustless and decentralized manner. If you check the wikipedia article about [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money), then you can find its list of functions as defined by William Stanley Jevons back in 1875:

* medium of exchange
* unit of account
* standard of value (omitted from modern textbooks)
* store of value

That's where this *""store of value""* thing comes from. It was not something that had been invented by bitcoin developers. Needless to say that the *""medium of exchange""* function is also extremely important.

It doesn't grind to a halt but it does get very expensive - I had a proposal 2-3 years ago (before blocksize was a huge debate) that got rejected for dynamically increasing the blocksize as needed, triggering some code in bitcoind if the mempool is over a certain amount which would allow any miner (or pool) who accepts the measure with an option in the config to temporally mine larger blocks. The idea was it would be recalculated every 512 blocks (there could be 4 blocksize changes within each difficulty change)

It would have really helped IMO in December with a huge uptick and backlog, the issue was just compounded until it got ridiculous, once the backlog was finally cleared fees went to a normal level again.

Scenarios talked about as speculation over the years (that drove significant hype) are now every day practise. Think for things like:

- hedging against your local currency going down the toilet (e.g. Argentina)
- alternate payment system when a national currency completely collapses (e.g. Venezuela).

If we take the crypto market as a whole (and account for the fact people still move alts in and out of Bitcoin a lot), I'm pretty sure some of the original actual use cases (shady stuff, online gambling, etc) is also still going.

"At this point the only stable use of bitcoin is to buy it and then immediately spend it all at its current price.  

People like to moan about it not being an investment, blah blah.  But even if you just us it as currency what you buy today, last month, last year may only be a fraction of its value today. 

The price of goods you spend bitcoin isn‚Äôt going down.  So that $10 pizza I want to buy Today with bitcoin I can‚Äôt because my bitcoin today is down say in value -60% from when I bought it.  Am I going to buy one slice and lose 60% ? 

That doesn‚Äôt incentivize me to hold onto bitcoin or buy it long term and it would incentivize sellers even less to accept. 

At which point if I am forced to buy and spend immediately to not lose money, where is the value over fiat for legitimate purchases? I mean most of us are converting fiat into bitcoin.

Seriously the best part of Bitcoin is when you get to use it globally.  I have used Bitcoin in at least 12 countries to buy everything from beer to T-shirts.  It is so strikingly different then when you use a bank, which often thinks I am on a fraudulent mission because obviously only a hacker would be buying a Starbucks latte in Malaysia with the grand plan to cheat someone out of the equivalent of maybe $5.  I realize people sometimes have a lot of money invested so I want to be respectful of that however if you don't \*use\* cryptocurrency there will be no adoption.  Plus using it has the side benefit of you automatically know something about the person on the other end (shared interest in cryptocurrency).  I wish price was discussed less and more discussion went back to where you can use it.  I have some LTC absolutely burning a hole in my pocket ready to go.

"It‚Äôs not just about spending it. Sure it is a large part but it‚Äôs also a means to hedge inflation, own your money, and promote self governance. 

We can‚Äôt have one without the other though. We need people to buy it and hold it to ever spend it. Adoption takes time. Exchange fees, transaction costs, and burden of use has shrank drastically over the last 2 years alone.

Look back to the Hard Disc Drive revolution. HDD were fucking massive when they came out. Inefficient. Costly. Bulky. No one knew how to use them or maintain them. But people saw the potential in them. Refinements were made, generation after generation, until HDD shrank and became as efficient as you see them today. From 8KB to 8TB drives. 2,000lbs to 2.0lbs.

Bitcoin and crypto will follow similar adoption paths. The utility just isn‚Äôt fully here yet. Part of taking a risk on it is seeing the future possibility. That‚Äôs why you were here to begin with.

"I don‚Äôt disagree. 

In my opinion (not that it‚Äôs worth much), the largest affect on price is still the subsidy. So we are still in a 4 year cycle. The last two bubbles lined up really well and I‚Äôm banking on it happening again (since the subsidiary is still very high). The last two ATH were beat the year of the subsidy and the the peak price was a year later. So I‚Äôm expecting 20k to be beat in 2020 (December) and then the following December would be the next peak bubble.

Adoption really grows during these rallies and then slows during the following bear market. I think adoption will continue to grow in this cyclic manner until the subsidy is closing in on zero. That‚Äôs when we should be approaching market saturation.

"Inb4, thanks on playing the devil‚Äôs advocate, missed an healthy non-fork discussion, with that said, imo:

> Is that necessarily true?  Or would they also maybe settle for an offer they can't refus

Agreed, an offer they can‚Äôt refuse is an offer they can choose.For it to be accepted, they need to be able to choose how to settle : FIAT or BTC for example. Someone needs to do the job all between, leaving the merchant with a choice only. Everything remains normal on their side.

> where does that stability come from

For now is Fiat, in their bank account. Again, someone must do the job all between, for them is just another day. And, the more we actually use crypto, maybe one day BTC is more stable than USD for example (I believe in this btw, but it will take time), for now, answer is fiat.

In the early days community was small so it felt like things moved fast and everybody was in it. Now the community is really large so it feels like less is happening, even though the opposite is true.  A lot of capital is at work to develop practical solutions. 

Bitcoin is a platform. The platform has many uses, and one of them is the everyday use as cash. So far the the best solution is Lightning Network. Many other uses cases can be covered by building a layer on Bitcoin. I expect that at some point some current alt-coin / blockchain startup takes the first step and moves over to build their thing as s layer on BTC.

"One of the aspects of Bitcoin I've found interesting is that as a technology, it's not just the first world users getting involved. Typically with a new technology, first world countries can buy and start using it first, and other countries lag behind. But with Bitcoin, users from third world countries are getting involved, and to a greater degree than first world. Here in America, we have access to credit cards, PayPal, ApplePay, Venmo, etc. The pure features of Bitcoin aren't any more than those (you can pay people with it. That's it.), so only the people who care about how the systems operate are the ones motivated to switch. So, we could as a community drive for merchant adoption, but I don't think that will be enough to get users to switch. Until there's enough identity thefts, and enough people affected by data breeches that they start to care about how the system operates will they start demanding change.

I think the key thing in first world countries that can drive adoption is implementing ""sign in with your crypto wallet"" with more websites; using that much better public/private key encryption to sign in, and getting a common UI experience around it. Showing users how easy that can be to be more secure, and as a byproduct having a crypto wallet available to them is an extra bonus...!";1;0;False;MidnightLightning;ea3wvxa;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/

"I see people not wanting to spend Bitcoin as a good sign. It's already proven that Bitcoin can be used as a currency. This ability is being greatly enhanced with Lightning Network (which the Bitcoin community does talk a lot about). 

What needs to be proven now is that Bitcoin is sound money. There is an idea in Economics called Gresham's law which basically means that people will spend their worst money first. If you want to buy a car and the seller will accept 4oz gold or 340oz silver, and then makes the strange stipulation that they saw 8 metric tons of dirt in your yard that they will also take as payment, you're likely going to unload the dirt first, knowing that it's the worst form of money among those 3. But if you can only choose between gold and silver, you're likely going to unload your silver as you probably consider it a worse form of money than the gold.

In more practical terms it seems that when poeple have the choice between spending their Bitcoin and their USD (or other fiat currency) they are choosing to spend the USD. ""Increase adoption by spending"", ""spend and replace"" and other similar ideas are at odds with Gresham's law. I take it as a good sign that people are mroe willing to part with their fiat.

"OP asks a reasonable question, to which there is a reasonable answer.

We were putting the cart before the horse in emphasising bitcoin's payment-facilitating properties. It turns out that assets have to be in *wide* circulation before they can usefully become currencies.

Since late 2013 I've made at least one large purchase a month in bitcoin, and always get a warm glow, telling myself I'm encouraging adoption (I always buy back whatever I spend - plus a little more!). But I've no evidence that's actually true.

Instead it seems like it'd be wiser to give btc directly to friends and family, hoping they're technical enough to keep it safe for a decade, but not technical enough to use it for purchases.

I certainly think that a day will come whereby bitcoin can realistically be viewed as a currency, but I'm happy for now to view it as a government-resistant long-term store of value.

"It surprises you that people are more vocal when things are ""wrong"" versus when things are going smoothly?

This is human nature....

As far as HODLing BTC or Spending BTC, who is anyone to tell anyone else what to do or what to focus on?

"Bitcoin is not strictly a currency. It is a store of value. This means it can be used as an exchange for goods and services or bought and sold like stock.

If you want a coin with emphasis on means of exchange, why not buy into BCH? That's one of the main reasons for the split, right?

People don't want to know nor listen to this, but a currency that doesn't incoporate inflation won't be used for transactions and will instead be hoarded as a store of value. ;1;0;False;jameswlf;ea455ua;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/
"In order for it to be widely adopted and used as a currency for spending it has to go through a cycle. Using it as a currency at the moment isn't great because it is so volatile and not accepted anywhere. It's market cap is way too tiny. Nick Szabo described the cycle of money [here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)
