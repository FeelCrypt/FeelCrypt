"If we're just talking about whether Thomas Edison was good or bad, I have two things to add:

1.  He was friends with the guy that owned the railroad so he had special dispensation to ride on the front of locomotives, on top of the cattle catcher.  This is how he would travel.  He said it was quieter and the air was better.  So just imagine a train coming around the corner with Thomas Edison sitting on the  front.
2.  I know it was before such things were thought of, but his chemical-heavy method of experimentation caused toxic messes that killed people at the time and continue to be enormous pollution problems even to this day.  Just a couple years ago they had to shut down a high school football field in Northern New Jersey because they found a bunch of his old lab equipment buried in the landfill beneath it.

"**High-voltage direct current**

A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power superhighway or an electrical superhighway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links.

"**Parable of the broken window**

The parable of the broken window was introduced by French economist Frédéric Bastiat in his 1850 essay Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas (That Which We See and That Which We Do Not See) to illustrate why destruction, and the money spent to recover from destruction, is not actually a net benefit to society.

The parable seeks to show how opportunity costs, as well as the law of unintended consequences, affect economic activity in ways that are unseen or ignored. Some conventional economic measures, such as GDP, can exclude the negative effects of capital destruction, while including the economic activity of its replacement. Thus, breaking a window may raise GDP, but harm the economy.

Not just that, I think the more important thing comes down to inductance versus capacitance. High frequency is very good at passing through capacitance based impedance, and very bad at passing through inductance based impedance. Impedance = frequency * inductance, Impedance = 1/(frequency * capacitance). So if the human body's impedance is primarily made up of capacitance, then a high frequency signal is going to see very little impedance (AC), where as a signal with no frequency (DC) is going to see an infinite impedance.;3;1;False;MasterDefibrillator;e0sz3ff;Bitcoin?

"For an equal voltage rating, AC has a 2.83x times higher peak-to-peak voltage difference than DC.

A 50/60Hz frequency is great at making muscles contract fast enough to not give enough time to let go, and at the same time polarizing them backwards and forwards as to keep them spasming for as long as possible.";2;0;False;jarfil;e0su0wx;Bitcoin?

You're talking about the wallet recovery feature...perhaps it is. But in Blockchain.info there is another function - the creation of a new wallet.

"But such a possibility still there? :-) Nicely. When I restore my own wallet using mnemonic seed, the system does not generate a new private key but gives access to the existing key. Right?

Yep, it has no idea, all it does is generate you a new key. There are so many keys though that it’s statistically very very unlikely for you to ever generate a private key that someone else is already using. No-one has ever generated a key that someone else already has. I think the actual number is more stars than are in the whole universe.;1;1;False;remoteradiostar;e0t50ae;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png
"Yeah you could say that, it looks at the Blockchain for the transaction history for the private key and shows you the transactions. If you import a private key into Bitcoin Core it will not show all your transactions until it’s caught up with the blockchain.

A web wallet like blockchain.info essentially holds your private key for you and handles all this on their servers, so you don’t really see what’s happening in the background.";1;1;False;remoteradiostar;e0tsuu1;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png
