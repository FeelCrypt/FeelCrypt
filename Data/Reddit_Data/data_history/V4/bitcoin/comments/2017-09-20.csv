Extremely difficult to learn, especially on your own without a teacher. I would not recommend someone who already doesn't have an extensive background in trading to attempt trading bitcoin, most people would be better of holding because they would just get exploited. When I first started it was in spot forex and I would still recommend anyone that wants to begin learning how to trade start with forex. There's a r/forex sub that's pretty good, but a lot of beginners on there.;2;1;False;2Cups_Pens;dn8plmb;"My father has recently fallen in love with Bitcoin and has started painting Bitcoin art themes, I present to you his first: ""The Bitcoin Bull"" by Ludvig Manukyan.
