"Nothing, I just happened to come across your comment and thought I'd mention it. 

You said, ""there are plenty of people who identify as ""democratic socialist"" who do align themselves with Che and Marx.""

Well, I've heard people making the distinction enough times to understand that there's a sought out difference there, even if a lot of people don't realize it. It's also not something that is 100% agreed upon by everybody, of course. I can completely agree that there are plenty of people out there who don't know the differences in their own beliefs in *all kinds* of areas. This wouldn't be the first. 

If you're interested in more depth on the distinction, check out the sources next to the following on Wikipedia:
 
""The term ""democratic socialism"" is sometimes used synonymously with ""socialism"", but the adjective ""democratic"" is sometimes used to distinguish democratic socialists from Marxistâ€“Leninist-inspired socialism which is viewed as being non-democratic in practice.[4][5] Democratic socialists oppose the Stalinist political system and Soviet economic model, rejecting the authoritarian form of governance and highly centralized command economy that took form in the Soviet Union in the early 20th century.[6]

So, you personally wouldn't say that such a country with a social safety net is made up of some socialist ideas and some capitalist ideas?

"I'm trying to follow your perspective, but I don't think you can just pick your reference point like that and then claim that I somehow have a fundamental misunderstanding.  It's fine if we have a fundamental disagreement, but it seems like you're playing semantics, unless you can tell me why your framing is more useful or descriptive.

I would contend that \*both\* capitalism and socialism are economic systems with distinguishing features, and most governments/states implement something that is not purely one or the other, but take on qualities of each.

To better understand where you're coming from, let me ask you this: What counts, to you, as a socialist system? Can a socialist system, in practice, integrate capitalist ideas? If it can, then at what threshold do you differentiate between a socialist system with capitalist ideas and a capitalist system with socialist ideas? If a socialist system can't integrate capitalist ideas, then how do we properly describe real world examples of ideas that come from socialist thought that are integrated into a capitalist system, or ideas that come from capitalist thought that are integrated into a socialist system?";1;0;False;mmortal03;e81n8zi;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/
