You can use Ripple to manage things that aren't IOUs.  There is no 'owing' that has to be involved -- it can track purely 'positive' amounts.  It could be used purely for tipping -- not a 'I owe you something' but rather as a 'I have found something you did to be a useful contribution to my/my society's wellbeing'.  What's interesting about Ripple is that all it takes is one person who has connections using it as debt as well as as-goodwill or as something else entirely and communities who treat ripple in completely different ways can interoperate together.  ;1;1;False;themusicgod1;cfs8h74;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
"That use case is unsupported by the system (and they're still the same IOUs that I mentioned before, even if you interpret them as representing something else).

As TradeFortress famously demonstrated, a naming collision and a little social engineering is all that is needed to be able to steal large quantities of tokens issued by widely trusted entities, and that's considered to be a feature, not a bug.

"> (and they're still the same IOUs that I mentioned before, even if you interpret them as representing something else).

The use case not only is supported - it is in use.  I have been using it that way since pretty much day #1 way back in 2007 and certainly since 2011 with villages.  Value comes very much from its interpretation here.  It's a functional interpretation, one that has consequences that I and hundreds of others have either accepted or work with without really caring for the details.

TradeFortress demonstrated that he's an ass who can't be trusted to be responsible, and cashed in on his reputation.  That's fine, and the people who trusted him may have been wrong to do so, especially to the crazy amounts htey have.  They now have been burned and scammed by him, and hopefully they will learn to be careful about him, in particular in the future.  That ripple 'allowed' him to take advantage of people who trusted him is not a flaw in ripple -- it is a flaw in *him*.";1;0;False;themusicgod1;cfs9lqr;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

"I think we can agree that the WSJ article is biased. But wasn’t it also informative? People now have more information about the Bitcoin situation.

The guys at the WSJ are our Messengers. They go out into the world, collect raw information, package, and deliver it to us. 

BUT, what we don’t acknowledge - or worse - don’t understand - is that these Messengers manipulate the information (change the code). They don’t write in their own lies, but they do deliberately omit information (they omit code - usually very important code).

Can we accept that this manipulation is the same as lying? it certainly has the same effect on the reader.";1;0;False;mashtonl;cfs8nxi;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/
