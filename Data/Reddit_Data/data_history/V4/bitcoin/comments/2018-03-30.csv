"What is it exactly that I don't understand? 

That global markets have lifted far more people out of poverty than any egalitarian means? 

That the extreme poverty in other parts of the world is anything other than relative?

That the guy with 4G that can't afford to feed his family without biking for days would be in the exact same situation but without 4G (and possibly without a job) in a world without capitalism?

That urbanisation and devolution of agarian societies is a part of the growing populations that stem from a decrease in child mortality due to improvements in medical technology and that free market systems actually help decrease the demographic problem?

But yeah you are right. Sustenance farming and having half your children die from trivial diseases and your wife die from childbirth is way preferable to ""living under the evil capitalist system"". Industrialisation requires a system of distribution of resources. You can either do it with market economy or by planned. Market economies tend to be freer and support individual performance to a greater degree and that is the main reason why I prefer capitalism to anything else that have been tried. It is not perfect but it is way less ""evil"" than any kind of socialism that I have read about.

It's not two sides...It's only one ...

"Wait, you said you read the indictment and the news and all your sources didn't tell you that there wasn't enough evidence to convict him of attempted murder and the charges were dismissed? 

The charges were: 

* Criminal enterprise and drug trafficking: Okay, criminal in a sense that it facilitates free drug trade. A violation of an unfair law
*  Money laundering: Yes, when you obtain money through drugs, they must be laundered. Kind of redundant, if you ask me. 
* Computer hacking: Okay sure. 

He is not serving a life sentence because he tried to kill someone. If anything, it was the prosecution who tried to put a tint on Ross, painting him as some kind of a mafia don because if they simply charged him with drug trafficking, the public and the jury won't care. 

Lastly, he didn't traffic drugs, he facilitates a free and anonymous drug exchange. That's it. No guns, nothing else that harms people. 
It was actually the rogue secret service agents who first stole his money, then pretended to be asassins to bait him into committing a crime the public cares about. And even in that they failed. Seriously, just read the news: https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-boss-first-murder-attempt-mentors-idea/
";1;1;False;ghettospagetti;dwix7sj;Today it's Ross Ulbricht's 5th birthday spent in prison. Happy Birthday Ross! Keep fighting for justice!!!;87dq6s;https://freeross.org/
"First off there was a mountain of evidence he paid people to get an informant and 5 people killed and although he wasn't convicted of that it was perfectly legal to present that during the trial to prove criminality and two courts accepted that

Secondly, the case of trying to kill an informant is still pending and it's a separate matter.

""In light of the overwhelming evidence, discussed below, that Ulbricht was prepared, like other drug kingpins, to protect his profits by paying large sums of money to have individuals who threatened his enterprise murdered, it would be plainly wrong to conclude that he was sentenced for accidental deaths that the district court discussed only in passing in imposing sentence""

This is from the ruling of the Second Circuit appellate court in 2017 when it rejected the appeal of Ross Ulbricht and upheld his conviction with the same verdict keeping the sentencing of the lower court also you should know that his lawyers never argued innocence ...all they argued is against the life sentence

 ""It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use,"" the judges wrote.

""At this point in our history, however, the democratically-elected representatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by severe punishment,"" 

In the end, sentencing guidelines actually justify his life sentence even without consideration of any attempted hit jobs or overdose deaths. The sheer volume of illegal narcotics that the Silk Road sold put Ulbricht in a sentencing category that technically allowed a life sentence

If you didn't know what trafficking drugs is and to what extent silk road was deep in that shit you don't know anything about the case ... Silk road sent drugs from Mexico all the way to Australia as an example.If that isn't trafficking drugs, what is?

"I think miners are important for crypto for several reasons. Among the reasons is that their hardware investments and projected ROI add a certain level of objective metrics to the value of a cryptocurrency. While some miners may sell below their expected price at times, they also represent a group of bitcoin owners that have a measure of resistance towards selling below a profitable price.

When certain people say that the price of bitcoin is entirely made up, I think that this position is lacking in nuances. While the market supply and demand establishes the price discovery, miners bring certain objective criteria to the equation.";18;2;False;Darkbitsky;dwj6kue;The Bitcoin Miner - Behind the Scenes;889ij5;https://i.redd.it/hs03qgb8tvo01.gif

Miners often tuck theirs so that shit does not get kicked under your shirt and scrap your abdomen. It is more for function than looks. Buttoned shirts are almost always worn by white collar jobs, where the work is more mental than physical and thus the tucking is mostly for looks. ;3;0;False;Lordtygon;dwjjszc;The Bitcoin Miner - Behind the Scenes;889ij5;https://i.redd.it/hs03qgb8tvo01.gif

I understand your perspective. Mining is naturally important for the security of transactions and decentralization of bitcoin. Though for me as a non-miner, I find it interesting, in addition, that mining could function as a price-stabilizing factor as well.;3;0;False;Darkbitsky;dwjnmab;The Bitcoin Miner - Behind the Scenes;889ij5;https://i.redd.it/hs03qgb8tvo01.gif
