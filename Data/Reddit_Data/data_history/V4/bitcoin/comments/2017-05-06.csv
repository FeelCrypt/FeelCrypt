"My comments equally apply to mining hosts where most users naturally decide to keep their hardware within the host. 

Why ?

1) Further centralizes mining reducing bitcoins security


2) No guarantee that they aren't fractionally reserve mining because most users will never ask for their hardware

I recommend people mine with p2pool if they cannot solomine.
