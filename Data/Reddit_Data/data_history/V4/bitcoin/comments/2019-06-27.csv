"**Lessons to be learned here:**

* NEVER go ""all"" in at once (especially at highs).
* ALWAYS DCA *(Daily Cost Average)* your way to BTC (Preferably find a good entry point). For this rally we just had, December/January was the best entry point. Wait for the next one. (Coming soon)
* Because you went all in, you will now have to wait a while (3-6 months) before you break even. (That's the penalty for going all in at once)
* BTC rallies are high, but will come down just as equally.
* Don't daytrade (or weektrade) if you don't know what you're doing. HODL instead.
* If you sell now (or later below $13.3K), you will confirm your loses. If you HODL, you will have an actual chance of getting your money back, plus a little more.";105;11;False;terabytetron;es7h8mu;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

Don't get me wrong,  I think it will succeed and be highly disruptive.  I think it may cause governments to trade international debts against BTC instead of USD which will mean that wars can not be funded by printing more USD.  But I do not think it will usher in a utopia of equality.  It will make the financial system be more honest, but for anyone born today by the time they are 18 they wouldn't even have a chance to own any.  There will still be mega ultra rich people.  Not saying its bad, but i'm also not under the illusion that it's going to be suddenly everyone is driving lambos and we are building moon bases with rainbows because of bitcoin.  It will make banks and governments more honest with each other, the people will still be issued fiat because governments require taxes to be paid in fiat.;1;0;False;;es5ep2y;2018 vs 2019;c42kig;https://i.redd.it/25cgvhwb53631.png

"The first or the second scenario? The first may well be plausible in that timeframe.

But as for the latter, pushing 300k would push market cap to around $6 trillion. For comparison the GDP of Japan, the 3rd largest by country in the world was less than $5trn in 2017. The EU (including the UK) was less than $19tr.

Of course you can not directly compare GDP to market cap like that, as a lot of value is massively held. But the point is anyway that at that level the price starts hitting up against some very real boundaries where it will take noticeable proportions of the available capital in the world being pumped in to drive the price up further.

To get to those kind of levels will take Bitcoin actually seeing a massive increase in use.";1;1;False;rubygeek;es5zn35;13,0000 boys, we’re vertical again;c5rwel;https://i.redd.it/vv9hnuz19q631.jpg

"1) Congratulations for not panic selling.  I'm sure that was (is) super scary.   Losses are on paper until you realize them by converting to cash or another currency.

2)  I feel very, very confident that BTC has not hit its ATH.  Not even close.

3) I feel holding BTC on timescales shorter than 4 years (one full halving cycle) is just trying to ""time the market"".... and is closer to gambling than actually using the value BTC offers.

4) Not a single person who has held their BTC for 4 years has failed to at least double the value of their holdings.  Not one.  Let that sink in. 

5) I (AManInBlack2019) encourage you (DaveIsHereNow) to set your goal to hold at least 4 years from the time of your initial purchase.

6) Be sure to take your BTC and get it off the exchange.  Don't put more in a soft wallet (like your phone) than you would normally carry in cash.  A hard wallet (like a Ledger or similar) is ideal for cold storage of larger amounts.   Wallets have keys.  The key is more important than the device...  you can smash your wallet and still get your coins back if you have the key.... but not the other way around.  Don't share your private key.  Give your public key to whoever you think might pay you.

Problem is, altcoins have a larger use factor and bitcoin slows down every so often. Take LTC/XRP/ETH as an example, all three can transfer money faster and are overall cheaper than BTC. I agree BTC is king but eventually when the majority of Hodlers understand that BTC isn’t the greatest coin, the rest of the market will pump and catch up (although I doubt any coin will dethrone it from 1st place in market cap);1;0;False;pentco;es5caud;13,0000 boys, we’re vertical again;c5rwel;https://i.redd.it/vv9hnuz19q631.jpg

"IMHO....we are gonna see these ups and downs, but as soon as the Asian market comes on, we will go up much more steadily then we have seen downs during todays and coming days sessions. 
US markers send it on these rollercoaster rides, and when we all go to bed at night the global markets push it up, up, up. Thank you China, thank you Hong Kong...thank you Korea.
This market is so much more evolved globally then it was in 17. 
Fun fact: 100,000 in HK is about 13,000 in USD. 
HK is going to be lit the F up tonight when they see that BTC has reached 100,000 HKD.
