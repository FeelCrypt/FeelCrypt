It sounds like you may not have understood tax law.  If I donate a Bitcoin and claim it has a fair price of $100,000,000, the tax deduction I could claim is exactly balanced out by a corresponding accounting gain of $100,000,000 that I 'realized' at the time of donating the Bitcoin.  It's not that the IRS can figure out the real value is $6,000, it's that it doesn't make an ultimate difference to my tax return what value I claim.;3;1;False;EliezerYudkowsky;e0oci0v;Farewell from the Pineapple Fund;8ieffr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/
".... I'm *not talking theoretically*, inflating the value of donations to charity then using it to (fraudulently) reduce your real tax liability was a [well documented](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/arts/art-donors-facing-stricter-tax-rules.html) , real form of tax fraud. 

It's even [an international problem](https://www.jayandjay.co.uk/charity-based-tax-schemes-quashed/) since multiple countries have similar deductions on charitable giving.  

You're playing the ""but surely"" game re: legal matters.  Implicitly assuming they are ( and always have been) as you would assume they would be if they were well thought out and logical and well designed. 

I'm providing sources here and you're arguing from first principles while apparently ignoring them.

"My biggest issue with the man, isn't so much that he is a scamster (though he sometimes is)

There are other people selling info\-products who at least make an effort to ensure their courses and guides are BEST IN CLASS.

Having seen his material and actually courses \- his ""product development skills"" is just downright lazy and not worth the money.
