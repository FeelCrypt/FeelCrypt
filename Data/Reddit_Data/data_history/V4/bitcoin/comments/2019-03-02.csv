I found out I had $1400 dollars worth of bitcoin in a hard drive I had in storage a while back.

It is profitable if they have an overdraft fee here or there or use their debit card with ~1% service fee, or pay ATM fees, or grow their balance and start using other services.;1;1;False;velamint;ehm9akq;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"The state isn’t “taking it” but the treasury is holding it for you for collections. It’s Wells Fargo who gave it to the state which I’ll admit is odd. Countless people find bank accounts ages later so the post is suspect.

Either way I recommend everyone look up ‘their state name “treasury” recover missing funds’ and do a search for yourself. I’ve recovered tons of money for people over the years. Usually it’s bullshit stuff like forgotten returned deposits, old paycheck, or a settlement check.

"Exchanges is way worse than banking. Even if the exchanges was 100% legit there is no recourse in case of someone getting access to an account and withdrawing the crypto.  


I think your original point about wallets (cold-storage at least) being the bank analogy, but specifically being their own bank. Which is the one thing that Bitcoin offers that is unique.";1;0;False;greengenerosity;ehljscf;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg

"If you ran a business would you spend money to find and confirm someone to spend money to close an account that is loosing money for us? Or would you say it is the customers responsibility to keep their information up to date - per the terms and conditions - sent out a letter and be done with it.

Finding someone that owes you money has value (expectation of getting paid back)

What doesn’t make sense here? Not sure what “really easy” is but that isn’t free and if you close 10k accounts a year are you going to pay someone 2h to find and confirm an identity (hire 20 people) vs automated system?";1;1;False;velamint;ehm9o9o;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"Yes because if you understood anything about cash flow, you'd know that cash just sitting in a bank is losing value. It can be invested, loaned, or granted which would generate further utility for society as a whole. 

Your money is virtually still there, maybe not in a physical sense. But even if you wanted to withdraw 10MM, all you need is to give the bank a heads up and they'll have it ready for you within a reasonable amount of time.";0;0;False;foxtroll;ehnf76h;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg

"Banks have to send in regulatory compliance reporting to the government. It isn’t just a few bytes of data it is millions of accounts with reporting and compliance. 

At the high end of the fed rate (2.5%) the bank is earning $32/yr (after reserve ratio requirements) and for this they have to maintain debit cards/fraud risk, maintain online access, send out statements (online only wasn’t common 12 years ago), and report to the government.
