"Not everyone is trying to 'make a buck'.. Frankly, I for one am doing the exact opposite. 


I'd like to think that we're on open sea aboard the giant tanker that is the petrodollar ship and it's taking in water.. The captains (greenspan, bernanke and yellen) are trying to fix the water hole leak by speeding the boat even faster constantly reaffirming passengers and workers onboard  through the speakers that there is no leak and everything is fine.. 

Meanwhile abeam starboard side we have a small fishing boat called bitcoin. A few years ago bitcoin was only a wooden raft and many big waves and sharks almost sank it. 

Now, even though the small fishing boat may be very rocky amid the big waves and may even capsize should a big enough wave sweep by.. But the fact still remains; the bitcoin boat is not pushed beyond its own boundaries by wreckless 'captains' that think they speed and steer the right way. 

I'm currently making the anchor and rope which I will toss over to the bitcoin boat and will be standing on the deck preparing to jump the ship when the dollarboat really starts to capsize. 

The sad thing is that many people will not be able to make it onto the bitcoin boat in time, some due to pure unluck, others because they were unknowing.. But the saddest part is that a few will miss their moment because they are stuck on the dollar ship collecting dollars.

Many people have said that and I think that you're right, but I never took alts very seriously (one more mistake in my extensive list), convinced that I am that even with (currently) inferior features, bitcoin will remain the only perennial cryptocurrency, the only one with a shot at reaching the mainstream and perhaps one killer app away from it. Alts would make me feel like I'm gambling as opposed to trading, but I concede that it's pure prejudice on my part. I would never have predicted that Ethereum would get so successful. Now that I have a grasp of bitcoin's behavior, I think I'm better off trying to make 15% gains on my 1000€ every few weeks while the bulk of my bitcoins remains in cold storage. The only thing that has prevented me from doing it sooner is that I was a victim of Mt.Gox's last heist and have trust issues with exchanges. Thanks for your advice!

"Maybe - but eroding trust like that would make a hard fork where the minercoin becomes the ""most trusted"" coin more difficult. 

Say miners pull support from 91. People are pissed but miners control the chain. So core says, ""see, what did we tell you."" And people line up behind core. Core forces a chain split. 

Who is going to want to be on the minercoin chain that can't be trusted vs the core chain that hasn't broken that trust (yet).
