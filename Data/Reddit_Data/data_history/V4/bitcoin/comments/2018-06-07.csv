All one has to do is moderate their greed, and all kinds of scams can be easily avoided as well.;48;0;False;BigJim05;e0aev3x;Oh no;8pdd8r;https://i.redd.it/7azmglqxsm211.png

"To all my haters and kinder souls,


I'm still working on this puzzle, but I have some life stuff to take care of. I'm getting my surgery details lined up now, thanks to the anon donor who read the reason I was looking to split the pot to this Reddit puzzle but instead gave me a donation for my life saving surgery. Thus, I'll be gone for a couple days or so from Reddit, as I have to secure the cashing-out process to pay this surgery bill -- unless I talk my oral surgeon into taking BitCoin ;-) that would be awesome in saving on fees.


Until then, good luck to all the hunters here!";2;0;False;AmirisJBrown;e09wh1p;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png
"Trust me I tried a lot  with the p, q theory and it was going nowhere.

So you're pretty sure it might be 24 and not a 12 word seed then? Hmmmmmmm ... I put the p's and q's hunch on the back burner since it involved math but I'll try my best to mull over what you got to the best of my lacking math ability.

"Damn, that would be a nightmare. I lost track of time this Monday trying out some stuff for this puzzle, so much so that I forgot I was suppose to meet a dinner date; but he wasn't worth my time anyway for a 1st date so meh no real loss. Still, this would be very upsetting if this puzzle thus far was based upon the wrong image lol!";-2;1;False;AmirisJBrown;e08r11d;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.
