Investing is gambling. All investments have a ~~probabilistic~~ chance component, and not all gambling is pure chance. One thing for sure -- a gambler who keeps hodling [an obvious losing hand], because ""There’s plenty of potential for it to explode out of nowhere,"" is a ...what's the word I'm looking for?

"No, you don't get it. You just need an account at Gold Money, and then you simply have to trust them that they'll hold your hold for you. Then you can trust that when you ask them to ""transfer"" 0.1g of gold to someone, they will update their database and decrease your holding and increase the other person's holding by that amount.

Then all you need to do is trust that they won't screw up, won't get hacked, won't leak your private information, won't give away or sell your private information to anyone who asks (even at gunpoint), and won't give anyone else your gold (even at gunpoint). 

So much easier, and better, because gold has Intrinsic Value.

Would you not rather just leave your investment there? There’s plenty of potential for it to explode out of nowhere as well. At worst, you lose your investment, which shouldn’t bother you if you’re actually investing rather than gambling your savings away. At best, your small investment gets you a new car. If you’re investing larger amounts of money, then none of this applies because you’d be diversifying and probably would’ve already mostly pulled out of Bitcoin long ago.;2;1;False;xx0numb0xx;eb06rm1;What can I get you for Christmas?;a2eczl;https://i.redd.it/6vkq9yp91w121.jpg

Not a good time to own crypto. Exchanges need to be investigated to ensure they are selling bitcoin that they have on hand. The only fix to this is people have to spend bitcoin and/or hold it in there own personal wallets and I imagine a lot people just leave their coin on exchanges where exchanges could get away with carrying as much coin as needed to satisfy transactions while selling more than they actually have on hand. Some transparency with tether would have been nice. I doubt we will see much action with bitcoin over the years. It won't die but it is going to need a few more years of maturing. China was a huge market for bitcoin and it is gone and not coming back. The whales are going to be dumping in order to get something out of this stuff. If it goes under 3k. It goes to 800. And when this stuff went to 19k, the transaction fees were stupid which defeated the point of bitcoin in the first place. And the worst part of it is is the shit coins that have come and gone. Btrash is supported by people because bitcoin is not controlled and so they seek a way to control even if that means they have to burn their own house down to get control over it. And exchanges listing every other moronic crypto currency in existence is also bad for bitcoin. The only positive I take away from seeing bitcoin go to 800 is that btrash and other shit coins will die and that will be a good thing. Bitcoin will survive the storm while reminding everyone about the big picture.;1;0;False;SpecialRadish;eb078i2;What can I get you for Christmas?;a2eczl;https://i.redd.it/6vkq9yp91w121.jpg
