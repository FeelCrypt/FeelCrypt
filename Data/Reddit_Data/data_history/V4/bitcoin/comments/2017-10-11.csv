"**Vertcoin**

Vertcoin (VTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and software project. It is a Bitcoin-like blockchain currency with additional features such as Stealth Address technology and ASIC resistant Proof-of-Work (PoW) function. The main difference between Bitcoin and Vertcoin is the latter's resistance to centralized mining and the long term promise of Vertcoin developers to keep it that way. Vertcoin has already forked two times to a new PoW function because of a veritable threat of centralized mining.

"Indeed.

To further complicate things, the first BTC transaction was from Satoshi to Finney.

If you're aware of how the FBI caught the Unibomber, it was through analysis of his writing styles.

Analysis of everything Satoshi has written matches Nick Szabo's linguistic patterns. Also, Satoshi's white paper mentions everything in the sphere of crypto at the time except BitGold, a project Szabo worked on before the Bitcoin whitepaper was released. 

It was almost as though BitGold(I think I have that incorrect off the top of my head) was purposely excluded to throw people off his trail, but ends up being a major point of curiosity.

In the last few months I've really been brushing up on my Bitcoin and cryptocurrency history, and there's a lot of pointers to Finney being the coder to Szabo's vision, if not others before ultimately Gavin Andresen became lead programmer.";4;2;False;grioco;do77lr1;Satoshi Nakamoto At a Blockchain conference in Santa Monica today.;75j79e;https://i.redd.it/elklu91it1rz.jpg

What I can say is listen to all 4 of them in order. The first one is fantastic. Joe is totally skeptical of bitcoin and you can hear his disgust during the show. During the show you can feel his wheels turning and he becomes interested in it. By the end of the show he is into it, and realizes it's potential. There was also a time when Andreas set him up with a wallet and the public filled it. It was fasinating hearing Joes elation that people funneled money into this wallet just by showing a QR code.

"**Oliver Sipple**

Oliver Wellington ""Billy"" Sipple (November 20, 1941 – February 2, 1989) was a decorated U.S. Marine and Vietnam War veteran. On September 22, 1975, he actively attempted to stop Sara Jane Moore as she fired a pistol at U.S. President Gerald Ford in San Francisco, causing her to miss. The subsequent public revelation that Sipple was gay turned the news story into a cause célèbre for LGBT rights activists, leading Sipple to unsuccessfully sue several publishers for invasion of privacy.

"From the [Wikipedia article:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#Dorian_Nakamoto)

> In a high-profile 6 March 2014, article in the magazine Newsweek,[32] journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto,[32][33][34] as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor.[32] Trained as a physicist, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian, according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business ""not under the government's thumb."" In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""[32][35] The article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and briefly chasing him by car when he drove to an interview.[36] However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified.[37] In a reddit ""ask-me-anything"" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank.[38] Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto.""[39][40] However, it is generally believed that Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account had been hacked, and the message was not sent by him.[41][42][43]";14;0;False;matman88;do7080e;Satoshi Nakamoto At a Blockchain conference in Santa Monica today.;75j79e;https://i.redd.it/elklu91it1rz.jpg

"I will go to my grave claiming that he is actually the real guy.  My reasoning for this is purely based on the twinkle in his eye when they first publically questioned him.  There is a part of him that wants to take credit for this, but knows it can't because his entire life will be ruined.  

Call me crazy, but I have a gift for this sort of thing and although it's not 100% accurate, it's accurate enough for me to stick to my guns on this.  

I also think the bitcoin community has fostered the concept that it isn't him out of respect (EITHER WAY) and that is wonderful.  Publically, I would say ""pfft, can't be him"" because I know anyone who rocks the boat on a global level like this will be screwed.  But privately, on the internet, I know this dude is satoshi.  I have never seen one bit of evidence that tells me otherwise.

I've really told you all you need to know, so no need to argue further. The bottom line is that the Constitution carries much more weight than you seem to think. If you really think that it can simply be interpreted with unlimited discretion, than you obviously didn't take the 10 minutes to read up on the information I gave you. Also, if a Constitution is only worth as much as it's ability to withstand change, why are amendments a thing? Simply astounding logic, mate.

"Who appoints those judges? Do you think they'd appoint someone who would rule against their own interest? I'm not arguing that the interpretation IS literal, but if it's not there are no bounds on what the Constitution might be taken to say. How could selective service be enacted after the 14th amendment? It is clearly unconstitutional. And you might argue that it was necessary at whatever point in time, but with each overstepping of the limits set out in the Constitution it holds less restraint over the massive power of the state. Hence in 1870 the federal government spent about 0.6% of GDP, and last year we were right around 40%. Where does it end? Well, if we keep going the direction we have been, and there's absolutely no reason to think that won't happen, we'll end up like Spain or Portugal or Greece, but with a dollar crisis that will supplant the US as THE world economic power.

There is no enforcement mechanism. There is one government, which derives its income from one source.

"I'm the biggest die hard believer of Bitcoin there is. 

But the government had no precedent to auction the coins off. They had to create it and this is something governments are NOT known to do.  Trust me, I'm glad they did.  But just because it had value didn't mean it was gonna be auctioned off. 

As I said explosives and drugs also have value but they don't get auctioned off.

I think I know what you’re going for, but I think you’re missing the mark by a bit. For one, the miners still must process transactions regularly. Gold miners can pull a DeBeers and stockpile their diggings to manipulate the price. Also, I can buy my way up into miner status without having to work a deal with other miners. Relatively speaking, it’s a much lower barrier to entry.

"No, it's whatever the person(s) appointed to have judicial power to oversee interpretation of the Constitution in accordance with established legal principles and the rule of law decides. The rule of law underpins any decision of the judiciary in ensuring its validity. To interpret the text literally would be to undermine established principles of legal interpretation. 

For example:

In a UK case from 1955, Section 8(1) of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 (UK) prohibited sale of ‘any food intended for, but unfit for, human consumption’. Children asked to buy lemonade, and a man sold them corrosive caustic soda which they drank, causing serious injury.
If we were to interpret this literally, there would be no breaking of the law, as caustic soda is not 'food', nor is it normally 'intended for ... human consumption' under the literal reading of the provision.

Seeing as this was obviously absurd, the court used a purposive approach to interpretation to hold that the expression 'sells any food' must be taken to mean 'sells anything (whether a food or not) as a food'. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the public from harmful products being sold as food, so this interpretation had to be the correct one. The man was found guilty and justice was served, as you Americans might say.

I hope that paints the picture for you.

The same principles apply to the Constitutional text; albeit there are much more nuanced rules and different theories for how it should be done in practice. Most interpretation is textual, in that the purpose of the material is gleaned from the text itself and not extraneous materials (such as parliamentary debates in forming the legislation). However that is not to say that it is LITERAL, which would be extremely inefficient and produce absurd results as demonstrated above.

Read up on [Strict Constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_constructionism), [Textualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textualism), and then  [Originalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism), and ask any questions you might still have once you've learnt a bit about how it all works. It does seem that in the American context regard can be had to the original intention of the framers, though their intention is not necessarily the overriding consideration in coming to an interpretive conclusion.

Im confident in the services I saw on the silk road, I'm confident he created one of the world's largest drug empires (selling heroin and meth etc.) and profited immensely off it, I'm confident he broke U.S. laws in innumerable ways. The fact that there are two separate state investigations into his separate attempted uses of a hitman shows an obvious pattern. Also why would they falsify the information and not even charge him on it of not out of an attempt to follow proper policies and procedures? Why even frame him anyway, the evidence against him was absolutely overwhelming. He was getting life in prison off just the drugs alone, you don't sell meth and heroin in industrial quantities over the internet and get a slap on the wrist.;1;0;False;Vagrant_Charlatan;do75dw7;Some day we'll look back at the US govt's sale of 144,336 BTC it stole from Silk Road as one of the worst financial mistakes in its history.;75bjr1;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/917463355593502720
