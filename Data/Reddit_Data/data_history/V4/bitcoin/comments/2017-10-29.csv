Not always, random crime yes. but that's not the bad type of crime. 

We have an epidemic of organized crime, based on drug, people, food and medicine trafficking. Kidnapping and such.  Those don't get better with better economy just as the Mafia didn't get better the more money NYC had. They are parasites and grow stronger with the economy.

"Dont misunderstand me. I agree with almost everything you say. You could introduce A crypto. a low fee low value crypto to manage the rampant money printing there is. 

The problem is that you have to treat this as a bankrupt company. 

What I would say is that the order of ""things"" are kind of off. 

1st you would need to get rid of the current government. That's step 1 no matter how you see it. Step 2 would be a massive shitload of debt restructuring, refinance and go into more dept with the IMF for example. Pass a shitload of laws regarding austerity and cut back on a lot of useless social programs. 

Then you use that extra money you got to rebuild the oil industry (I work in the oil industry, it's much worse that you can even imagine). Specially the infrastructure in West venezuela, which gives you light crude you need to produce the heavy crude from east venezuela. 

The tourism industry is a bit more tricky. You don't need much CAPEX because you don't need to build hotels. You need other people to build hotels. So some really good incentives like no taxes for X years and such to incentivice foreign investment. 

The problem with the tourism industry is the extremely high crime rate, specifically kidnappings, ESPECIALLY of tourists.  So you would need to tackle that before you make any headway in the tourism department.

At those points you don't care much about the currency because everything coming in is in USD which has a negligible inflation rate.  You can just let companies pay their workers with USD and forego the currency exchange control and you solve a part of that problem. 

If companies can charge/buy/pay  in USD they can fix part of thei cashflow problems. Obviously it's not going to be the supermarket. But oil services, manufacturing, mining, etc can move in a different currency. You can even tax them at the current rate no problem. Kind of how it was back in the day. 

After you have those. Then you can switch your currency to a crypto oof sorts to provide transparency and control. But there is a long road of other stuff that needs to happen before ""Bitcoin saves us"" 

You could introduce the low fee crypto somewhere inside that train oof shit that needs to happen. but it  can't be the 1st thing. First you need to work on the foundation of the country. Doesnt matter if its a crypto you work with if there are no companies that pay it and 60% of the population is actually unemployed.";1;1;False;daguito81;dp1qx69;Hahaha;799zq0;https://i.redd.it/g2w5a8mnkkuz.jpg

"It was socialism, corruption and the authoritarian regime that ruined your country. So, the first step for your coumtry would be to get rid of their currency, and replace it with something decentralized, which can be any cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin with it's astronomical fees. 

Second, your country has a lot of oil and potential for tourism which are great economy boosters. If the citizens of Venezuela perform a coup and replace the commies with a capitalist, libertarian government, you can start working on rebuilding tourism and oil companies. Unemployment would fall and more and more jobs would be created. 

Then the employers could pay workers in cryptocurrency, closing the entire circle. 

I do understand your anger, but introducing cryptocurrencies into Venezuela and replacing the bolivar with let's say, Ether (which has low fees and fast confirmations) would be the first step in saving Veneuela. A few years will be needed, but it's totally possible. 

Cryptocurrencies WILL save the entire world and I'd bet you a thousand Bitcoins that by 2027, Bitcoin will be priced 200,000 dollars, Venezuela will become one of the richer countries in the world, and North Korea will overthrow the Kim regime.

"How exactly will bitcoin save us again?

The problem for us is not even the accessibility of USD, it's literally that regular people make 10$ a month.

You can't even buy bitcoins with that without losing most of your money to fees.

Sure it helps programmers and freelancers that can work remotely. It works as a payment avenue that's better than PayPal for example.

But  that's a very small percent of the population. Another small percent earns in USD and they're doing much much better.

For the other 95% of the population. How exactly does bitcoin help them? Companies are struggling to keep afloat and have severe cash flow problems.. So now they re going to pay you a lot of money in bitcoin magically?

That's like going to a company on the verge of bankruptcy and saying ""well you don't sell anything, you're making almost no revenue, your profit margin is negative for the past 3 years. Your creditors are knocking on the door, you have 4$ in your bank account, you owe 400000$, you have no way to get more money .... You know what you should do?  Use bitcoin!""

"Fees are charged when you attempt to USE bitcoin.  There is no fee to HAVE bitcoin.  Investment houses require you make so many trades a month or they charge you a fee just to hold your stocks and/or bonds.  And of course with each trade, you get charged a fee also.

Even credit card transactions charge a fee.  The only difference there is that the merchant usually pays the cost, and that cost is factored into the price of the goods you are buying.  That's why some places offer a ""cash discount.""

Bitcoin fees can be significantly lower than bank fees.  Especially if you need to send money overseas.  And Bitcoin fees are a hell of lot cheaper than money orders, bank checks or other forms of guaranteed funds.  And for all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is guaranteed funds.
