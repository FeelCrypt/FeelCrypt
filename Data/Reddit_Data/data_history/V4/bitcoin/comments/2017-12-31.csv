This. We all probably found it exciting to think that the world would somehow overnight start accepting bitcoin as a replacement for cash and credit cards, and were disappointed to see very few merchants getting on board even as the price kept rising. But merchants who need to keep their lights on and customers happy don't want to deal with wildly fluctuating currencies and eight decimal points, and fanatical users who are willing to wait up to an hour for their transaction to be confirmed before they can enjoy that first sip of coffee (yep, people did this). Bitcoin as a currency is nowhere close to being a reality, but that doesn't deny its utility as an emergency exit from an economic system built on the debt slavery of hundreds of millions of people.;1;0;False;ddmnyc;drz5at6;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"As soon as they say ""leave"" and you don't, it starts at trespassing which probably would just get you a friendly ""talk a walk buddy"" from the cops.  If you stand your ground and/or keep at it, then it becomes harassment and at some point stalking.  If someone feels threatened after you've asked them to leave alone, the states may very well have different guidelines about it (and countries too for that matter), but again, you have a beef with THE COMPANY, if the person is at home then you have absolutely no right to harass them while they are where they live with their family.

>Depends on the jury. Many have never seen $300,000. 

All of them would have families.  No one likes the idea of some lunatic outside their doors harassing them.  There are proper channels to do that in, and 95% of objective third parties would think you're in crazy town following a guy home from work to harass him because you're angry.

And with that, peace.  Keep arguing with yourself if you'd like.

Happy New year and may BTC and crypto profits fall upon us all!

If you did that to me, I would call the cops and talk to an attorney about a restraining order.  

Also, I assuming I had any level of professional experience, would at that point have you discuss things through an attorney and would not want any direct communication.

Coinbase hasn’t been bad minus the few times it’s been down due to load on the exchange.  They’re still the most trust, especially over some Chinese company which the Chinese gov’t could freeze assets at any time.

"Every. Single. Person. Here. should use ItBit. Yesterday I wired a lot of money to my ItBit account and I was able to trade it for BTC within 20 minutes. Literally as soon as the wire finished it was in my account. The only problem is they mostly operate on stock trading days, and withdrawals for BTC go out in intervals of two hours on trading days. I have never had an issue getting an immediate buy order filled or withdrawal completed. ItBit is by far the most professional and best exchange I've ever worked with. They're based in NYC and a lot of hedge funds use them, apparently.

"Building 7 would have to lose 67% of it's strength to breakdown.

It didn't get hit by anything at all.

The twin towers are overbuilt to withstand wind loads (calm winds that day), and were specifically designed to withstand a plane strike.

In fact, the head engineer said in a ~92? article from Seattle after the twin tower car bombing, that he believe only controlled demolition could take down the towers.

"You're generally not swapping, say, AAPL stock for IBM stock.  You sell AAPL - taxable event - then buy IBM.  

Any profit is capital gain.  How long you held the property (stock) before selling determines the rate at which the profit is taxed.

As it stands now, in 2018, if you buy BTC, then trade it for ETH, then trade for LTC, then trade for USD, you've had 3 taxable events which need to be reconciled.  

You buy $1000 of BTC on Jan 1.

Jan 5, you trade the BTC for ETH, but the BTC then had a value of $1050 USD, so you've 'made' $50.

Jan 9, you trade the ETH for LTC.  The ETH has a value of $1110.  You've ""made"" $60.

Jan 15 you trade the LTC for USD at $1160.  You've 'made' another $50.

You had a total of $160 in profit.  But... what it you never went back to USD.  If you just kept it in LTC.  You've still had $110 in 'profit' which you'll need to account for, which wasn't clearly the case up until this new tax bill.  The only property that qualifies for 'like kind exchanges' were modified to be 'real property'.  I'm predicting this is going to bite a whole lot of people in the butt next year, and possibly prompt some changes at the behest of some GOP donors who were heavy in to crypto :)

"no, i mean that every transaction is a taxable transaction, not just in and out of USD.  Trade BTC to ETH?  Taxable transaction you need to determine the value of and pay tax on.  

I've dealt with my taxes on any conversions from crypto back to USD (very small profit this year)  Having to keep track of every single transaction, and the USD value of it at that time (for tax purposes) is going to be a bigger issue than most people realize.  You bought ETH with BTC Jan 9, then on Jan 11?  Two taxable events.

I honestly really do not think GOP had any clue what impact this change would have, but they changed the tax language disallowing ""like kind"" exchanges *except for real property*, which crypto is not.

"For any business to have money sitting around in a currency that is not the currency they primarily use to pay for their operating costs is lunacy. Especially if it is volatile.

If you buy a product for $100 worth of BTC, and by the time they need to pay their suppliers, that same BTC is worth $50, and that repeats over a large portion of customers, they're fucked.

This doesn't just apply to crypto - no company will retain large amounts of foreign currency if they can avoid it, unless they also have according amounts of costs to cover in that currency (e.g. a US store that has French suppliers may very well choose to retain some EUR to hedge, but, say a US store that buys nothing from Europe would convert any Euro they get from customers to USD ASAP to prevent exposure to currency fluctuations).

Not converting would be the equivalent of speculating with their creditors or shareholders money. Their creditors certainly wouldn't appreciate that, and most shareholders wouldn't either (if they want to speculate in crypto, they can do that themselves, rather than have their non-crypto investment adding elements of risk that they'll have a hard time controlling).

"""The point of Bitcoin"" has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but to me it has no point anymore. It's served it's purpose - it sparked a ton of cool projects backed by smart people, companies and corporations that solve actual problems, have actual use cases and will maybe even amount to something. Bitcoin never really had any intrinsic value and it probably never will. Bitcoin is a piece of software. 1st gen software. We're at 3rd gen variations now, being implemented into products, workflows, actual uses, most of which will start rolling out early in 2018. 

Even Enjin Coin has more utility and market sense than Bitcoin. It's funny 'cause it's true.

I have 0 BTC left in my porfolio after hodling for years. It's useless to me. When I transact value I use other coins anyway, and I've done so for a long time now, and I don't mind it at all. I feel comfortable doing that.

The point of Bitcoin, above all else, should be to do that, right - transact? If I'm feeling increasingly comfortable using, for example, ETH, LTC, XRB or any other coin to transact - what is the point of Bitcoin exactly?

And I don't care about BCH's solution, either. They're both dinosaurs in my eyes. :/

EDIT: For context, I work in a brokerage company / exchange office and I help people to buy BTC on a daily basis (we have fiat/BTC pairs, like other exchange offices have fiat/fiat pairs, because why not). I'm also a developer, I tried out as a miner for a while, I run multiple nodes for multiple coins just for fun, etc. So I've been around Bitcoin for years now and... it just didn't age well.

"You also need to explain that the coin is meant to fund the company that developed the platform.  The business model is that it would be too complicated and expensive to collect transaction fees directly on transaction so they create a token that needs to be ""destroyed"" when transactions take place on the platform.  The company distributed the token to fund their operations and the token is regulated.  In fact they had to pay a for their dealings with Roger Ver.

And even putting that aside, in your analogy, it would would still argue that it **is** unethical for the bank to keep said new currency for themselves, though there may be practical issues involved that make said situation more complex in practice, since they are fractional lending etc.

> If they cared enough before the fork they could have had their cash in hand.

This is surely not a condition that the exchange wants, they don't want everyone suddenly withdrawing all of their currency. It would work much more smoothly for **both parties** if the exchange just does the ethical thing and gives the customers the option to withdraw their portion of the forked currency.";2;1;False;stravant;drzhn6u;BitMex has just liquidated and distributed their Bitcoin Cash in the form of Bitcoin to their customers.;7n24lu;http://bitcoin-daytrading.com/bitmex-just-liquidated-distributed-bitcoin-cash-form-bitcoin-customers/

I have no idea why everyone refuses to explain that.

"Ripple is XRP.  There are many factors in my opinion that lead to it being among the most stable options out there, even right now, and a great option for long-term sustainable growth.  Most importantly is the incredible technology built into their processing network, claimed capable of being able to scale out to the same size as Visa's processing network (currently 50k per second), they're already doing 1500 per second, reliably, consistent 24/7 whereas the speeds for BTC and ETH are prohibitively slow.  XRP payments finalize in 4 seconds.

">Yeah... but that still doesn't mean that what the exchange did is ethical.

It doesn't make it unethical.  They own and control the Bitcoin just as your bank controls the money in your account.  If some random company or group airdropped a new currency and said that they would give everyone a one to one match to US dollars by serial number, no one would expect their bank to give them this new currency.  In fact, if it was expected to have any value at all it might cause a run on the banks so people could get cash with serial numbers.  This is what people who wanted their bcash should have done.  They should have withdrawn their Bitcoin to get the serial numbers (so to speak).
