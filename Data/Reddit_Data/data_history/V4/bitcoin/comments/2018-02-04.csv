Don't be silly. The history shows that the price has risen. You haven't intelligently spotted booms, they've just been happening.

Jeez, you will lose your money if you think you were ""smart"" to make money with bitcoin. The price rose thousands of percent over an incredibly short time - any useless cunt on the planet could win buying it.

> Cashing out coins has never been concern to me at all, and I‚Äôve done it with no issues quite a few times now

Yes, but if you keep throwing your money back in you will lose it eventually. The bubble will burst, maybe it already has.

Point being (a) You've lost money by selling and buying back at a higher price, maybe you feel this has hedged your bets, but it certainly shows that you don't have any great insight, and (b) You have no more idea than anyone else what the future holds and (c) You're most definitely not smarter than anyone else.

"**Escalation of commitment**

Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.

Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment (""sunk cost""); despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

Your example also works, you'd just hold the BTC indefinitely while the price goes up if you have other currency to spend. Which is my point, BTC doesn't work as currency because it's always economically preferable to hold it and spend USD instead.

""Value"" is relative but in most cases it's backed by some underlying fundamental source of income. Growing corporate profits, interest yields, dividend payments.

Because the price is based 100% in speculation. BLOCKCHAIN DOES NOT MAKE MONEY.

The fact that BTC investors have convinced themselves that there's profit to be had by the widespread adoption of the underlying technology (which, frankly, seems unlikely given the scaling problems associated with ""proof of work"") demonstrates the fundamental disconnect between crypto ""investors"" and the financial realities of investing capital.

"**HODL**

HODL is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to keeping, i.e. holding onto the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" The Street.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders. According to the Financial Times, it was the reddit forum Buttcoin that helped popularize its use.

They definitely will, I just meant that if a service isn't available in one country at the moment it's because the company hasn't dealt with all of the regulatory stuff to establish it in that country at the current time (or in the case of some countries it wouldn't be worth it to establish it in that country so they would just never set it up there). RH is definitely going to roll it out to the rest of the developed world, it's just a matter of when and in what order. Id say they're probably going to go for the EU next and then once they have it squared away with the actual Union they'll be ready to ship it to either the easiest to set up or highest activity countries in the EU fairly quickly.;1;0;False;Fermit;dtp3o1d;Thank you Coinbase!!

Well you really cannot expect an exchange to put a customer first when they are directly in competition with their customers. Captain and crew get the first lifeboats, passengers can go down with the ship. However what is in their best interest is for the market to stretch out a bit more time, and for more of the wealth to gravitate up to the top wallets with enough time to make safe transfers in to low volatility stores. The change in the wallet coin distribution in the past few days is striking. But using customers as another way to mine coins through fees & making profit from spreads in competition, that is Abe's exodus levels of dark. You don't want to spook the herd on the way to the abattoir.;1;0;False;PacificaNorthwestNZ;dtpw9e7;Thank you Coinbase!!

"I don't agree with you completely, but this is a very good post. Thank you.

Bitcoin was the first implementation of Nakamoto Consensus. This gives it an authenticity that is unmatched currently, and I don't foresee an obvious way that this is likely to change any time soon. This makes it the strongest store of value over the long haul. You points about developmental improvements are completely valid. But it is unlikely that any particular token will overtake bitcoin's top spot in terms of long term deflationary value storage. The ones with more transaction capacity but less security might possibly even facilitate more transactions, but in that case they will quite possibly become something like what iron coins were in the past: good for day to day use, but bad for storing or transacing large amounts. 

>Because right now it‚Äôs not true adoption, it‚Äôs swarm after swarm of people trying to double their money in a few weeks and then gtfo.

I think this became true during the run up somewhere between about $1500-$3k. I suspect that the run up to that point was cause by one or a few of the people on the world's richest 50 people list doing some serious accumulating. They likely decided it was a win-win situation, if the price would have stayed low they would have been able to accumulate a very large portion of available coins, and be in on any future mass adoption in a big way. Or alternatively, like has happened, they knew that the upward price pressure caused by their accumulation could spark a speculative mania that would decrease the amount of coins they could buy with the money they chose to commit but also make the coins they did manage to acquire worth far more than they paid for them.  Some of the folks on that richest person list are both very technically proficient and willing to take risks. Especially when they could risk and lose billions of dollars and still be among the richest people in the world.

"Maybe you should read his reviews. The YouTube is a front for the scam. Tai is just the face and does not own any of the cars/houses he claims to. The products he sells are not what people expect and is just more YouTube garbage.

Read this review:

""YES. Absolute scam. I bought the ‚ÄúAccelerator‚Äù program, and it turned out to be absolute ass. It‚Äôs crap. Just rehashed old crap from Tai‚Äôs live calls that you get on YouTube. His live videos are also bullshit, I‚Äôve seen the same ones reply many times. The paid content is shittier than the free content. It‚Äôs all just bad reviews of books, and then affiliate marketing he does with other companies in which they share no useful information.

There is like ONLY 3 Videos on Tai‚Äôs behind the scenes business stuff. All 3 of which are just Tai talking shit to his team. ‚ÄúYou better appreciate that you‚Äôre working for me‚Äù.

The Knowledge database is crap. No useful info. Just buy a book and you‚Äôll get 100 times more value. Just watch the hundreds of thousands of other useful videos that are free. Not even worth $10 in my opinion.

The money program is a bullshit program. Almost ZERO money advice. It‚Äôs crap. Junk. Poop. Serious ass. Don‚Äôt waste your time. He just rehashes maybe 3 or 4 ideas together‚Ä¶ And then the rest is affiliate marketing. It‚Äôs all crap.

From there, they try to up-sell you on the bigger packages that are $5,000+. They make you hope that you can someday meet with Tai and get him to invest in your business or personally mentor you. But it‚Äôs all bullshit.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SAVE THEIR TIME, GET REAL EDUCATION, AND KNOWLEDGE AND BETTER THIS BUSINESS. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. WORTHLESS PROGRAM.

Not to mention, when I asked for a refund, it has been 1 week and no one has gotten back to me. They‚Äôre just stealing our money. I have to do a charge back through my credit card company. They replied once saying that Oh we have to have one of our guys call you to make sure you have a good experience. Well, that was 7 days ago, and nothing.

Bullshit product, bullshit service. Avoid at all costs.

The only reason I tried his program was because he gave a 60 day money back guarantee. He isn't even keeping up to that one promise. He keeps saying he has all this great insider information, but none is to be found in his program. He makes his program sound like it's so solid, professional, and well put together, but it's really crappy, you're really really better off just finding a few relevant things for yourself with a youtube search.

Again. I don't care what promises he makes to you. It's all crap. Really is. He does provide some good tips. But, just watch his free crap for that. It's pretty much all rehashed other YouTube videos, and information from books. He really won't save you any time in terms of trimming the learning curve. Actually, his program sucks so bad that it will make you waste maybe 2-3 days before you realize that you were scammed and lied to.""

Spending effort to out scammers is a good way to defend the value of Bitcoin.   

If you are a hodler, you have a vested interest in ending scams and scammers that put Bitcoin and the value of a decentralized ledger at risk.

Maybe you think that ignoring scams and letting suckers get tricked is a good strategy.   But bitcoin is tarred with the same brush as every shit ICO and scam coin out there.

"Tia Lopez is basically a funnel for general information. He hits a lot of topics. For example his 67 steps is a decent program for concepts in business / life. 

If you want to learn anything technical or specific to business, just go to more reputable sources. He is an ok speaker, but is somewhat disorganized in his presentations. He can be a good motivating factor if you need motivation and organization in your life. 

But if you are already an entrepreneur with any amount of success, he may not be the best person to buy a course from. 

""Those who can't, teach"". That sums him up pretty good. He isn't a billionaire. Learn from a billionaire. ";1;1;False;RossMacdonald;dtqc7ra;We need to talk about Tai Lopez;7v7fgl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7fgl/we_need_to_talk_about_tai_lopez/

He‚Äôs not a scammer he‚Äôs a mentor. I‚Äôve done his courses in the past and have made 6 figures with stuff he‚Äôs taught me. If you don‚Äôt want people to get wealthy by taking an entertaining class instead of googling it and learning it from some of the most boring people in existence or just reading up about it that‚Äôs fine but don‚Äôt fall into lies that known racist has spread about him. The people who called him scams are people whose known for hating Mexicans or people who don‚Äôt even have enough sense to come in out of the rain so don‚Äôt fall for the BS circle jerk dude! If you need more proof he‚Äôs not a scam watch the H3H3 podcast he went in some detail about people whose banged hardcore numbers off taking his courses. Remember just because some people are too stupid to make money off his class doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a scam because there are people out there who are too stupid to go to college and call college a scam too. ;1;0;False;;dtq5dkc;We need to talk about Tai Lopez;7v7fgl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7fgl/we_need_to_talk_about_tai_lopez/

THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT. Every course/major in every college there is a free alternative that can get you into a top level job. Programming, supply chain, finance, English... learning something faster, easier, and making it easier to get you the entry level job is what all colleges should do.
