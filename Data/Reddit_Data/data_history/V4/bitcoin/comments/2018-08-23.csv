And your alternative breeds even greater corruption by centralizing both political and economic decision-making to the same body of human beings and furthermore only functions when local, emergent, capitalistic markets between groups and dissenting ideas are stamped out.;1;1;False;erdtirdmans;e4o4x80;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

"Again we can agree to disagree. 

>I literally have done this, with no college experience that's the only way I'd be able to work as a software engineer. 

Oh that is so full of shit it isn't funny. There are innumerable pathways to a CIS career. It's not as if you completed some hurculan feat. Try that on someone who doesn't own their own company and who doesn't have a background in tech.

I don't care if you went to college or not. Being successful without college or having gone to college doesn't impress me one iota. I care about how someone thinks and if they're competent and reliable. The thing is you have just admitted on this thread that you have no interest in evidence, alternate points of view, or whether or not you're actually even ""mostly"" right. ALL you care about is pimping your pet perspective. And, I got to say, what you're putting out here isn't exactly what I'd call an A game of economic analysis or political understanding. 

So we're done here. ";1;0;False;Znees;e4o6vjs;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

"That’s correct. Max did contact me by email but these did not include any extra details about the case. Thanks for looking into it anyway. 

Yesterday I received a final email from Finnish police/NBI and UK police/action fraud, both I have forwarded to Max’s email.

I look forward to hearing from you guys soon.
