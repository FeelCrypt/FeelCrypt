"You are not stuck with a false dichotomy of either only using Bitcoin or only using fiat. You can leverage the strengths of each when appropriate to your benefit. Bitcoin is a useful tool to use for many use cases. Lets explorer a few of them:

1) **Saving money** - Buy 500 USD of BTC on coinbase pro for 0.15% , transfer BTC to purse.io for 0 fee , Buy products on amazon for 18% off(after purse fee). Total saved is 90 USD - 0.75 USd (total spent on fees) = 89.25 USD saved with Bitcoin

2) **Regulatory Arbitrage** = Capital flight , Buying less expensive and higher quality drugs on the DNM in a much safer manner , avoiding civil asset forfeiture, effects of bail ins and bail outs, insurance for frozen bank accounts, etc.. 

3) **Timestamping** - Rather than driving to and paying a notary to authenticate a contract or statement you can do so for a very small tx fee or free with opentimestamps or other services like tweetstamp that is even more trustworthy than a notary

4) **Payment Rail** - Many merchants use Bitcoin as a payment rail where they auto convert to fiat so have piratically 0 risk from volatility and get the many benefits like no merchant credit card processing fees and no chargeback risk

5) **Digital Gold** -Some people treat Bitcoin as an investment, where they Buy some and wait for it to mature in a couple years than take profits . Bitcoin is disinflationary so over the years has appreciated a lot making it one of the best investments one can make - https://dcabtc.com";1;0;False;bitusher;eu866vu;Bitcoins war against drugs..;cf4lio;https://i.redd.it/jfmlk1zgr7b31.jpg

"Correct! This is because the supply of Gold can increase if the price of Gold increases, like all other goods.

The supply of bitcoin cannot respond to increases / decreases in demand with increased / decreased supply, this is what makes it truly unique.

It‚Äôs a feature not a bug. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre really criticising Bitcoin. You‚Äôre showing that you don‚Äôt understand the laws of supply and demand and how Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt react the same way any other asset / commodity does.

"I used to be a huge druggie, like multiple drugs every night. Then I heard of the Silk Road and other dark net markets, and was like ‚Äòoh shit I need to get some bitcoin so I can buy drugs on the internet.‚Äô As soon as I got some and realized that it wasn‚Äôt just Silk Road drug credits, and that it‚Äôs actually its own system completely separate from all that... I was like holy shit I‚Äôm not spending any of this. Never spent a satoshi on the dark net and started spending all my play money on bitcoin instead of drugs. It very well may have saved my life. I still dabble but it‚Äôs no longer the focus of my life. I mean, cannabis is still pretty important to me but compared to what I used to do it‚Äôs basically nothing.

It‚Äôs funny that they say bitcoin makes it easier for people to access drugs and that‚Äôs bad. You‚Äôre completely right. That abundance of cheap money creates a bad economic situation and inspires despair in those who takes the time to look at it, but don‚Äôt have the means to profit off of it. Those people often turn to drugs and other self-destructive lifestyles because why the fuck not. 

Most people who buy drugs with bitcoin end up massively regretting it because of the missed economic opportunity. Far fewer people who buy drugs with cash end up regretting it. I want people, especially those who think all drug use is bad, to think about the implications of that.";5;1;False;highdra;eu8azy1;Bitcoins war against drugs..;cf4lio;https://i.redd.it/jfmlk1zgr7b31.jpg
