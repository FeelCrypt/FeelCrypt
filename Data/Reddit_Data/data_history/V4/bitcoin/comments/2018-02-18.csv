"Unless you live near the guy you're gonna have to find a way to transport those items. This is why we don't use gold anymore.
The current monetary system is accepted, but that doesn't give it value. It's a mystery to me how USA can be in so many trillions of debt and still have a strong currency.
Yet China produces more than 50% of the worlds goods and has a relatively weak currency.

Also, when you pay someone online you have no anonymity whatsoever. If you live in a country where you could be persecuted for your religious beliefs, take India for example, you may find the use of a currency such as XMR as a viable option for buying a bible.

And as I said, USDT is backed by dollars.
Also, DigixDAO is backed by gold. 

Smart contract platforms are also extremely valuable as they save time and money that would be spent on costly lawyers and potential litigation.

Factom is one example of a crypto that is trying to revolutionise file systems.
File systems are costly to maintain and have central points of failure whether it be physical file cabinets that could be burnt down or hard drives that could be destroyed or hacked.
Also, if you get injured in another country and have to go to hospital the doctors will have a very hard time trying to track down your medical history. Distributed file ledgers could make the process a lot easier and potentially save lives in this field.

Crypto is a pandemic. Whether the current ones survive is another question but blockchain is going to rapidly find its way into many sectors.

Despite what the name suggest, these are not just currencies and do not rely on global adoption to be worth something.
You can trust financial institutions, fractional reserve banking and inflationary currency.
Bitcoin was born out of a recession because the current monetary system is not good enough and a lot of people are fed up.";5;1;False;Alty1994;dufa7tn;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"Cryptocurrencies will necessarily deflate as long as the total value of all stuff in the world keeps increasing (which it has been since we invented money). By the very simple formula:

    
    value of 1 unit = (total of all assets and goods in the world) / 2100000000000000 

To stop deflation once and for all, you have to adjust either the amount of tokens or the total value of stuff in the world - i.E. stop economic growth.

The latter might be inevitable at some point, since growth will find some natural limits in the amount of resources we have at our disposal (and thus how many humans and jobs we can support). But I don't think we are currently near that limit. And there are reasonable scenarios to overcome those current limits (i.E. going interplanetary).

Edit: I'm also not sure what you mean with M0, M1 and so on. But the idea that a currency (say Bitcoin) explicitly  requires a sub-currency (lightening) to function sits uneasy with me. Our most important commodity should be designed from the ground up with all requirements in mind. Current cryptos to me look like make-shift solutions and patchwork. And since modern currencies (fiat or crypto) don't work without trust, that's quite the considerable flaw.";1;1;False;NotExecutable;dug506t;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

"The value of any currency is based in the whether there will be a demand for it in the future; i.e. it is widely accepted and largely retains its value. Historically people have used commodities as currency. Things that were intrinsically useful therefore valuable (gold, silver, copper, ...). 

It is tempting to think a fiat currency is backed by trust, but that's really not the case. You need to look at what aims to guarantee the future demand for a currency, in the case of the USD:

* A globally integrated economy with a $19 trillion GDP, the (2nd?) largest in the world
* A Federal Bank with $4.5 trillion in Assets
* Tens of billions in foreign currencies and foreign treasuries held and managed specifically to stabilize the USD and US economy
* The world's most powerful military and its allies to protect the above


The USD, US economy, US Fed and US military so deeply embedded with the rest of the world that any orderly dismount of the USD would take decades to not take the rest of the world with it.

This is M.A.D. 101. China could crash the USD tomorrow morning by dumping their US Treasuries and USD reserves; provided it is willing to annihilate its own economy in the process.

For good or bad, the above drives a stable demand for the US Dollar and guarantee its value will remain stable over very long periods of times.

Current cost of having your transaction processed within 10 minutes is $3.26, and thats with daily transactions being lower than they have been in nearly 2 years. To get it within 6 blocks (1 hour) is $0.54. This is considerably more expensive and slower than VISA although it is cheaper and faster than Western Union.

you also have to factor in the fees and waiting times of selling bitcoin on an exchange, if an exchange will even do business with the 3rd world country you're in (which it probably doesn't). Then it don't look so good.

How much monopoly money has been created (no idea)?  How much monopoly money will be created (no idea)? Who creates monopoly money (hasbro)? 

There are about 16.8 million bitcoins. There will be 21 million and no more. The last bitcoin will be created in the year 2140. Who creates new bitcoins? That's complicated, but the simple answer is they are given out semi-randomly as reward for maintaining the bitcoin network.

And sure, there are limited editions video game skins, but they are created by the developers of the video game, and the developers can keep making as many skins as they want. They can pump out millions and flood the market. The game developers and Hasbro are the central banks in this system. You have to trust them because they can do whatever they want because these systems are centralized. They can mint however much they want. In bitcoin, there is no analogous central bank like Hasbro or the game developers. There is no one who can keep minting as many coins as they want. There is no one who can shut the network down. There is no one who can freeze your account, reverse your transactions, or take your coins away without your permission.

Again, I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is going to succeed. But I will argue that Bitcoin is the first of its kind and this is an experiment worth having, no matter how risky it is. Those of us involved must acknowledged the risk and acknowledge that we are participating in something that has never happened before and the odds are greatly against us. 

So when I see these comparisons to monopoly money or beanie babies or tulips or video game skins, I slap myself in the forehead. They are terrible analogies and don't make any sense if you know how bitcoin actually works. It's like someone saya, ""Global warming? But it snowed yesterday!"" These people clearly have a shallow understanding global warming. And you clearly don't understand even the basic premise of bitcoin, based your comments. 

I just wish more people would acknowledge their poor understanding off bitcoin and not form an opinion anyway. Skepticism is healthy, but what happened to curiosity?

If the price at which you can sell a good goes down, do you produce more or less of it? You produce less, which is a stabilizing force in a context where the economy as a whole is offering more goods.

I'm not settled on this deflation though, and am keen to see nuanced arguments for or against eny position, as long as it isn't the bog standard ""muh deflationary spiral"" textbook argument, which doesn't distinguish between the general price level dropping because of a reduction in money supply (as when debt contracts) and price levels dropping because of rising productivity.

"I have just realized I wrote a very long wall of text, but please to read through it is really important people understand how and why these things matter. 


If I want to buy BTC with USD today, you will charge me the spot rate. Now if I want to buy BTC with USD in a year but agree on the price today, aka a forward price, we need to find a way to determine what is the discounted value of each currency. Usually we will make (broadly) the assumption that I will invest my USD at USD base rate for a year, and you will invest your BTC at BTC base rate for a year. The reason the baseline price is calculated this way is because failing any better option this is what each participant will do.


Let's arbitrarily say the spot price is 10,000 or 1 BTC = 10,000 USD and there are Central Bank issued Treasuries with US interest rate is 2% and BTC interest rate is 1%. By making this investment in 12 months, you will hold 1.01 BTC and I will hold 10,200 USD. The forward price is then 10,222 or 1.01 BTC = 10,200 USD. 


The problem with BTC not having a Central Bank is that there is no equivalent to Treasuries, therefore there is no minimum guaranteed interest rate amd no guarantee you will receive your funds back. And that's a significant problem, because unless you want to bear an unknown risk and potentially large losses, you will need to find a 12 month investment with a guaranteed return. From there, you have two options:

*  Invest within the BTC to not be exposed to BTC price movement. You may be able to lend your BTC to someone, but because there is no BTC Treasuries the price is 100% dependent on their credit risk and there is no guarantee you even receive you BTC back. The return will be highly unpredictable.

* Invest outside of BTC and expose yourself to spot price movement. Frankly with the volatility that should not even be considered an option.

In both cases, you will have to protect yourself against these risk by demanding very high returns to make up for the risk of losing your investment - really that's how any investment is priced.


What this means is that when I want to execute a 12 months forward BTCUSD, I will get unpredictable prices,  no way to evaluate if my counterparty will be able to survive until the settlement, and likely incredibly high hedging costs.

Granted it is an exercise in futility and shouldn't be taken at face value, but using available information Bloomberg estimated the BTCUSD implied rate at [57%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/keynes-worked-out-the-bitcoin-interest-rate-it-s-57). What this means is that to hedge a $100 investment in BTC, I will pay $57 a year in implied rate. Within less than two year, the cost of hedging is greater than the value of my investment itself - which makes hedging completely pointless. To give you a feel for it, the highly troubled Argentinian pesos implied rate is hovering around 30%, while EURUSD is at around 2%. 

Without reasonable cost of hedging, it is impossible to take anything but very short term commitments on any currency. Without long term commitment to a currency, it's spot price will wildly swing up and down making it a horrible thing to hold onto as a store of value or a means to get paid or pay suppliers. BTC is facing a catch 22 problem, it cannot be widely used without stability and it cannot be stable without wide ussage - largely because there is no market wide base interest rate setting process.

"I'm completely with you that bitcoin is not money and does not function well as a currency right now (for both technical and economic reasons).  But I think you and many others take the skepticism a little too far and miss a broader and more nuanced view.

>The value of bitcoin comes from the idea that it's usable as a currency, right? 

Not quite.  People value bitcoin for some present utility (the use-cases that it has or had before fees got too high; the ability to access darknet markets with it, the international remittance use cases or proxy payment network for fiat currencies where they don't excel like in getting past borders and capital controls; and even ( if you're in a country with a hyperinflating currency),it can be a decent hedge or relatively good store of value. 

 But mostly people value bitcoin for its potential future utility: for its potential to become money (actualized unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange).  What people always fail to realize about money, is that as money, the good ceases to be the unit token, but is instead the network good; or access to a network of trading partners. Alleviating the problem of the double-coincidence-of-wants and having a medium of indirect exchange is a good, a utility in itself.

A market commodity can't just start out in this position as money...it has to evolve into that position. There are coordination problems inherent to that process (roughly: why would I buy a token for use as money...when its not yet money or widely used in indirect exchange? Yet how can I get something to be a medium of indirect exchange, if a lot of people don't buy it and agree upon price(s)?  ) 

The volatility and rampant speculation you see is an inevitable symptom of this process of basically bootstrapping the token through this price-discovery process.  You can't program price stability into a crypto-token.

>A stable store of value to function as a medium of exchange. It sucks at that. That means that it has no inherent underlying value.

Sucks compared to what? And just sucking relatively doesn't mean ""no inherent underlying value"", it means less (even giving you the benefit of the doubt that you understand that there's no such thing as ""inherent"" value; all value is subjective to the individual)

We all know its volatile. This is uninteresting. What's interesting and important is that the volatility (over the long term) appears to be gradually decreasing, with the increased adoption and with more use-cases and transaction loops developing. And the bubble cycles appear to play a similar role as lotteries do in helping to produce public goods (or rather alleviate assurance problems in the face of free riding).

>The fact that you're treating it as an investment is bad.

Depends what kind of investment you're treating it as. Nobody is promising returns. Nobody thinks this is a stable or low-risk investment.

> The asset's liquidity is provided by other people buying into it, hoping that other people will buy into it and make their asset more valuable.

As is the case with any commodity which has found monetary uses (beyond its other use-cases which don't stem from network externalities). This does not make it fraud or ponzi. Again, refer back to the development of market monies and the coordination problems with getting from mere token to money.

> It's like investing into a tech company that doesn't make any products or do anything. 

Having a medium of indirect exchange, common unit of account, and store of value is one of the most important and useful goods in society. Without it, we'd still be in the stone age. Money (like any other good) can't beneficially be monopolized; but must be in constant dynamic flux and position of competitive pressure bearing on it.

>It can't go on forever and as soon as people stop buying into it and start selling off, the entire thing collapses like a house of cards.

Again, the interesting thing (and the question that you skeptics need to answer) is: after 8+ years, and nearly everything being thrown at it...after many bubble and bust cycles (at least three of which have been greater in relative magnitude than this most recent bubble and crash, and it having rebounded an order of magnitude higher each time)...why should we believe you that bitcoin is like a house of cards? Why should we believe that this time its different?


>I'm not saying don't buy in. Bitcoin is an amazingly volatile speculative asset, and that makes it a good gamble in the short term. In the long term, it functions like that type of scheme.

Actually, it is the long-term holding which has paid off so far...its the noobs day-trading who always get rekt.

"> No, it's more like saying that I have no fundamental problem with peppers; I don't enjoy their spiciness

You either don't know the meaning of those words or have so little capacity for thought that you fail to see the problem with those words in that order. If you do not enjoy the spiciness of peppers, then you have a fundamental problem with peppers. That being said, there is nothing wrong with having a fundamental problem with peppers, and your position regarding peppers and other peoples' freedom in consuming them is laudable. One can have a fundamental problem with peppers without believing that peppers ought to be eliminated. 

> I think it is morally unconscionable to threaten to lock me in prison if I do not eat peppers.

If you lived in a society wherein one of the conditions of being a part of that society was that you had to eat a pepper every day, and you chose not to do it because you have a fundamental problem with peppers, then I would ask the question of why are you still a part of a society that you fundamentally disagree with? You can leave that society. Why don't you do that? Why do you insist on staying in the society whilst simultaneously not doing the thing that the society expects/mandates of you to stay in the society?

> Yes but you must use fiat currencies to pay taxes. And it's that threat of violence if you refuse that gives the fiat currency value.

Your understanding of economics is hilariously misinformed on so many levels if you think that the ""threat of violence if you refuse"" is what ""gives the fiat currency value"". 

Currency has no inherent value, as I've already said. Currency is the means *by* which goods are exchanged, not the value *for* which goods are exchanged. It's no different than BTC - your collection (or mine, for that matter) of ones and zeroes has no actual worth, it merely denotes an entry in a public ledger, and when I buy something from you, you give me the good, I subtract some amount from my entry in the ledger, and you increase your entry by the equivalent amount. You haven't actually ""gained"" anything by the means of this transaction... unless, of course, somebody actually considers the entries in that ledger as important. 

The whole notion of a fiat currency exists because people have accepted the fact that I opened up with - that currency is the means *by* which goods are exchanged, not the value *for* which goods are exchanged. Therefore, the slips of paper themselves don't need to be backed by anything. They're just the equivalent of those ledger entries in physical form. You work for a company for a while, and the two of you have agreed that your work has value for that company. That value has been (arbitrarily) quantified as some number of these slips of paper that they give you. When you buy food, you and the merchant you buy from agree that whatever you're buying has some value, and that the amount of value can be quantified by some different number of paper slips that you hand over. 

If the US government announced tomorrow that you could pay your taxes in Bitcoin, do you honestly believe that the value of the dollar would change? Not one bit (pun not intended). Your 5 dollar footlong at Subway would still be 5 dollars, your salary/wage would be the same as it had been before, and the majority of the world would go on as though absolutely nothing had happened. 

>  I have no problem with people using seashells as currency, as long as they don't force me to use them against my will.

No one is forcing you to use the US dollar. I already said as much.

> Or maybe they could just leave me alone? I'm aware that there are all sorts of ways around taxation, but that doesn't make taxation ok. That doesn't mean that I haven't been a victim of coercion. I should be free to live my life as I please, and if their currency is so fantastic that I should use it then they can advertise its benefits to me, not threaten to lock me in a cage if I refuse.

You're fucking delusional. You receive services from this government, whether you know it or not. You don't live your life in terror of brigands sweeping by and stealing your shit and killing you. Your tap water and toilet water is (regulated to be) so clean that the bottled water you may or may not buy is just your tap (or toilet) water put in a plastic bottle and marked up at a hilarious rate. The medicine and/or vitamins that you may or may not consume is regulated and tested to make sure you don't fucking die of bad medicine or suffer from being sold fake goods. The damn roads you drive on or sidewalk you stroll on is put down by the government and kept (somewhat) clean on a day to day basis. Your government provides you innumerable services you likely don't notice or even care about... until you go to countries where those services aren't provided (or where there is no actually functioning government, like South Sudan or arguably, until recently, Somalia) and you quite possibly die because you continued to hold those same assumptions. When you figure out a way to do all those things by yourself or dispense with the need for those things entirely, feel free to raise your own landmass from the ocean floor, construct your self-sufficient settlement, and renounce your US citizenship to live on your self-sufficient island paradise. As long as you're still taking advantage of these services, for though, you damn well better pay for them so long as you're making the money to afford to do so. And the service provider requires that you pay them in US dollars. 

I specifically want to address this part by itself: 

>  I should be free to live my life as I please

You are free to do whatever the hell you want. But so long as you are within the borders of the United States, you must obey the rules and laws that the US government has laid down. At least... you must obey them if you don't want to be ""locked in a cage"". If you're fine with being locked up in a cage, though, feel free to do whatever you want (please note that I am not actually advising you to break the law). 

> What are you even doing in a cryptocurrency subreddit at this point...? I get it, you love fiat currency manipulation and dream of the government's rock hard cock up your arse, but some of us don't. Leave us alone.

Let's correct a few misconceptions:

1. This is a cryptocurrency subreddit. Specifically, this is about Bitcoin (as would be evidenced by the name of /r/Bitcoin). I'm here because I'm interested in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technologies. And that's kinda why anyone is here. Not everyone here believes in the at best naive, at worst idiotic things you have said.

2. One can both be interested and invested in Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) while also acknowledging the importance of a government or society's existence. The two are nowhere close to being mutually exclusive. 

3. The delusional nonsense you've been spouting in this comment and others has nothing to do with Bitcoin. The ideology you're espousing isn't even libertarianism, it's closest to anarchism. Feel free to go to /r/anarchy, which is where you'll likely find the echo chamber you desire, since you seem to be averse to debate and hearing opinions different from your own. It could also potentially be classified, I suppose, as anarcho-capitalism, so you can also go to /r/Anarcho_Capitalism and/or /r/CryptoAnarchy for other echo chambers. 

4. If you think that Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrencies are somehow immune to currency manipulation, you're delusional AND dumb. It might not be the same kinds of manipulation, but you'd better bet that it has been and will be manipulated just as any other currency.

5. Being a fan of the idea of cryptocurrencies does not mean that basic laws of economics cease to apply. So long as we (humans) have a need for currencies, economics will continue to apply. It is only if/when we reach a post-scarcity world that economics as a discipline might cease to be relevant... and even then, I'm not sure. 

6. You are so hilariously misinformed (or uninformed) about the absolute basics of economics that you should really stop talking about fiat currencies, currency manipulation, fractional reserve banking, or really anything involving economics, because anyone with even an iota of knowledge will either laugh at you or insult you. Quite possibly both. ";0;1;False;MrMonday11235;dufjgrv;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

Most people seem to have either no knowledge of history, or choose to completely ignore it. The argument that fiat currencies have value because they represent faith in governments is totally correct, but people are starting to loose faith in those governments. This loss of confidence isn’t isolated to random countries in africa or south america, and it’s an issue that’s becoming more and more common throughout the world. Income inequality is going to increase, the rich get richer, and with that more powerful and immune to the issues faced by the majority of the worlds populations. Our current culture, at least in america seems to portray us as invincible. Most of those people who suffered through terrible times like the depression and world wars, those who could remind us of the past are gone. America never truly recovered from the crash in 2008, we’ve created a patchwork economy that isn’t going to be able to withstand issues brought on by things like automated systems in the coming years. Those institutions and individuals largely responsible for the crash in 2008 suffered very little for their mistakes, mistakes that the rest of the country are still paying for. When shit hits the fan again, why would anything be different? Btc and crypto as a whole has definitely gained a lot of popularity as a potential get rich quick scheme, but every time that it drives up in price and drops it attracts a new wave of individuals who come to learn about and understand the technology and potential behind it. Every time that Btc and the crypto market recovers from a crash, more and more people begin to have confidence in it as an entity that has the potential to replace a system that has proven to work primarily for those at the top at the cost of everyone else. I know that I’m sounding like an alarmist, or even an edgelord, but look into how the crash from 2008 was “fixed”. Foreign entities carry a large chunk of american debt, and if a situation arises where we can’t return that debt we’re not going to be able to fix it like we did in 2008. If this hypothetical situation were to occur, what do you think is going to happen to the usd? Who do you think is going to suffer because of this? Who do you think is going to be found responsible for all of this? If history is any indication, you, I and everyone else in this thread dicking around and arguing about Btc are those who would suffer the most. This knowledge is becoming more commonly known, and something that I personally believe to be a contributing factor to the recent surges in crypto’s popularity.

Thanks for the link. It was a pretty interesting read. I agree with them that criminals will definitely have, and already has, a use for Bitcoin.

Their arguments for it are pretty weak, and the valuation they later come up with in the paper is based on that assumption which makes me very skeptical.

Wages haven't gone up because automation and a shift in the economy to low-labor industry have reduced demand for labor. 

Facebook makes more net-income than Walmart despite only hiring 25,000 people compared to 2.3 million for walmart. And even companies like Walmart are reducing their need for labor with things like automated check outs and automated warehouses.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange

The value of money is set not just by the quantity but by the quantity x velocity relative to the amount of goods being traded. Bitcoin has incredibly low velocity because of the incentive to hoard. A significant percentage of bitcoins haven't moved for years. Even the ones that do move move much more infrequently than normal currency.

A sudden increase in velocity (i.e. millions of people who had bought bitcoin years ago and barely moved it spending on a daily basis for goods and services) would significantly reduce its value because there would be a significant increase in supply of currency relative to demand.

For people who think bitcoin will always be a ""store of value"", this isn't a problem, because stores of value necessarily have low velocity. If you want to be able to use bitcoin as a day to day currency then it means if that ever happens there will be a significant drop in value so you should be wary of speculating ";1;1;False;suninabox;dug8lng;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

" As per Satoshi's own design for Bitcoin the difficulty of mining is coded-in to the system to require more and faster CPU power as the blockchain gets bigger longer. (read the Satoshi paper to understand!)

Right now it costs up to 450 Satoshis per byte or around **261kWh** of electricity to confirm EACH transaction, or about US $28 worth of power in the cheaper power countries (like China and Canada) and there are around 2600 transactions per 1 MB block in the blockchain every ten minutes. 

2600 transactions per ten minutes is tiny in the banking sceme of things. In banking, according to CapGemini/RBS World Payments Report, there are 1.06 billion movements per day in the banking system.

If each transaction in the banking system cost cost 261KWh, like each transaction in bitcoin, then the banking system would use **261,000 terawatts a day.**

Total WORLD electrical generation is **20,000 terawatts**. This is a lot less than the cost of running those 1.06 billion  banking transactions as if there were bitcoins.

So unless the banking system has secret Star Trek dilithium crystals somewhere generating power from antimatter, you can easily see that per transaction the cost of bitcoin is extremely much more than the cost of the regular banking system.

"I just copied the numbers I found on this site, I don't have any interest in fudging the numbers: 

https://bitcoinfees.info/

The 6 block estimate is now half what it was in my last post, although I realize now they're using a very low average transaction size to estimate it, so it wasn't accurate.

The average bitcoin transaction was 600-700 bytes in 2017, its currently 1.4 kbytes, which is admittedly above norm. I don't think its accurate to try and use extremely small transactions as indicative of average costs.

you're also not factoring in exchange fees since its basically impossible for people to use bitcoin for things like remittances without using an exchange. its also not feasible for them to use it for remittances because even large exchanges like Coinbase only do business with the US, Europe and handful of others.

Which is why Western Union is still in business, because no one is going to send bitcoin to their family in Uganda when there's no way for them to exchange bitcoin for usable currency.

>For comparison: In the US, a typical credit card merchant fee is 10 cents, plus 3%. So, for a $10 purchase, that's 40 cents.... I don't particularly like comparing to cc's though, because that is a centralized system that requires trust and permission to transact.

daily bitcoin transactions are at a 2 year low and dropping, which is why fees are also dropping, because there's so little demand for blockspace that miners can put almost any transaction in a block regardless of fee and not lose out. As soon as transactions increase there will again be fierce competition for blockspace and fees will rise.

"> That's fine, I don't have anything fundamentally against fractional reserve or inflation. I just don't personally want to use it, and I suspect most sensible people would not voluntarily choose to use a currency that facilitates the perpetual theft of their value by the central authority which controls it.

Do you understand what fractional reserve banking is...? Because there is no ""perpetual theft of value"" by any central authority. You've been using ""central authority"" basically as a stand-in for the Fed and the government, so that's what I'm assuming you mean, and they don't steal any value from your currency. Fractional reserve banking has to do with... y'know... banks. And I still don't see how they're ""stealing value"" - you can get all your money out whenever you want. Unless you're referring to inflation? If so, then you fundamentally lack an understanding of what money and inflation are in modern economics.

Your words also contradict themselves. You claim to have no fundamental problem with fractional reserve banking or inflation and then go on to detail your issues with both that are fundamental to what they are. That's like saying ""I have no fundamental problem with peppers, I just don't like them because they're too spicy. If they weren't spicy I'd love them."" 

And, incidentally, plenty of sensible people voluntarily choose to use currencies backed by governments. Honestly, you're the one who's coming across as ""not sensible"".

> I don't have that option with fiat currency. The government can fuck with it however it pleases, to my detriment, and yet I am persecuted if I refuse to use it.

... Jesus... where to begin.

First of all, I'd like to reiterate that the ability of the government to ""fuck with"" your currency is a completely separate concept/issue from fractional reserve banking. So let's get that straight.

Second, your dollars have no inherent value. There is no magic ""true value"" of a dollar bill (and honestly, the same is true with Bitcoin, but that's a different issue that I'm not going to get into here) that the government is hiding or screwing with. All currencies are just tools to facilitate exchange between parties. You can just as easily use seashells or something else to conduct your business so long as other people are willing to accept what you use. 

This ties into my third point, which is that nobody requires you to use the US dollar. You will not be persecuted for not using the US dollar. Use whatever fucking currency you want. That being said, if you wish to be a US citizen or resident and avail yourself of the benefits of being a US citizen or resident (work privileges, military protection, diplomatic services, travel privileges, etc), then yeah, you have to pay your fucking taxes in US dollars. That being said, nobody is forcing you to live in the US or be a US citizen. If you prefer to use some other government's currency because you believe their system or government to be more trustworthy, feel free to try to acquire citizenship with them and renounce your US citizenship. Or, if you trust no governments, feel free to renounce your US citizenship without having any backup ([though I will warn you that this is an awful idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3seeat/i_renounced_my_us_citizenship_and_became_stateless/)). 

Currencies and governments are tools of society to make everyday life easier. You're not required to use either, but if you don't, be prepared for society to tell you to fuck off. And don't expect to reap the benefits of being a part of society without doing the things that being part of society requires you to do.";8;1;False;MrMonday11235;dufbat7;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

"Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule](https://xkcd.com/1053/) for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :

You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?

If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.

Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.

What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

"[Disintermediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation) is your answer.

mp3 files were curiosities to RIAA. The MPAA thought AVIs would never be of interest. Was email a threat to the USPS? They didn't think so. And surely bricks and mortar B&N stores had nothing to fear from this new-fangled Amazon.

In none of those cases was the technology-driven end game clear. In all of those cases the end game was not remotely near what they wanted. The end game of cryptocurrencies isn't yet clear. It certainly will not be what the financial institutions today want.

"Why is a currency that goes down in value better than a currency that goes up? If you are talking about how volitile it is,  that's because people are slowly learning that ANYTHING can virtually be currency. It's at its infancy and it *will* keep going up as long as it gets easier to use (and it is). Once most people undertand this fact,  bitcoin will deflate more stable. 

People don't like money to hold it,  they like it to get things. It's such a simple cycle yet no one understands this. Everybody eventually gets rid of the bitcoin to get what they want eventually and then the next person holds their money until they want to buy something with it. I'm not mad that I bought something with it and it went up in value, it already went up enough for me to get what I wanted. That's what deflationary currency looks like but you go ahead and love your slowly decreasing dollar. Be happy you don't live in Venezuela or Zimbabwe.

"Good point. The idea of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anybody for it to work, but in reality you still need to trust exchanges to play fair, give you the money you're entitled to, etc. However, good news, because decentralized exchanges are being developed. A decentralized exchange is basically nothing more than a piece of open source code that anybody can verify and reproduce, and that functions as an exchange when executed. Nobody owns it or makes money from it.* It's security is based on a blockchain, for example that of Bitcoin or Ethereum (see ethfinex.com). When decentralized exchanges start working people won't need to trust centralized exchanges anymore if they don't want to.

\* If the creator charges fees for use of the exchange, somebody else will copy the code, remove the fee part, launch a new exchange, and people will use that one because it's cheaper.";1;0;False;izhikevich;dufyz00;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

"Fiat currency is physical Monopoly money backed by threat of war (economic or otherwise).

The idea of programmable money, aka money that does more than denote its own value, is almost an absolute certainty in the near future. It is too valuable and tenacious an idea to be just considered merely hype. Nobody knows if Bitcoin will continue to be the standard bearer for that idea in the future, but it is the most influential one that exists today.

While rampant speculation does obscure the true value, it also produces the perfect conditions for significant and lasting innovation to occur.

We live in a world where all we’ve ever known is fiat currency. Dismissing better alternatives is simply a failure of imagination.";27;2;False;admyral;dufdynu;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

A core issue of any cryptocurrency that will hamper mass adoption, that I rarely see discussed.

The amount of monetary value is steadily increasing over time. If you can't make more of your currency, you will run into the issue that your smallest denomination will be worth more than the least valuable product one might reasonably buy.

There are 2100000000000000 units in most cryptocurrencies. If the total value of any such currency exceeds 21 trillion, 1 unit is > 1 cent. Current money supply in fiat is about 110 trillion dollars (1 unit ~= 5 cents).

The problem will be even worse in reality, because cryptocurrency tokens can be destroyed and lost forever, further diminishing supply and increasing deflation.

"Satoshi, while brilliant technically, was unfortunately not an expert in economics. 

Bitcoin, being a finite (and shrinking) supply, is deflationary by nature, and a deflationary asset can never be used as currency. 

People are right when they say Bitcoin is buoyed by hype, that it's basically digital monopoly money. It will continue to be volatile until people see through the hype, which I think won't be for a long time because Bitcoin is hard to understand by many. But after that, it will tank to nearly nothing.

Right now, whales and smaller cunning traders know the scheme of pump-and-dump for which bitcoin is extremely useful. They will hype (pump) and get the gullible to buy, and then sell after it goes up for a while (dump), and repeat this process. They'll take a lot of people's money. 

I believe the losers (money-wise) in the end will be 1. those who mistime the market (buy high, sell low), and 2. those who hodl for too long (until bubble finally bursts and bitcoin becomes worthless). All of those people's money will go to those who really understand what Bitcoin is and how to take advantage of it.

"**Disintermediation**

Disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries in economics from a supply chain, or cutting out the middlemen in connection with a transaction or a series of transactions. Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediary (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with customers directly, for example via the Internet. Hence, the use of factory direct and direct from the factory to mean the same thing.

Disintermediation may decrease the total cost of servicing customers and may allow the manufacturer to increase profit margins and/or reduce prices.

"Market share needs to increase a lot, users need to become more diverse, but in the end it always will be volatile, because it is an open currency. 

Consider two things:

1. There are more volatile Fiat currencies around (Venezuela, Zimbabwe) etc. Most ppl compare to the USD or Euro which are exceptionally stable.

2. Fiat cannot be withdrawn all at once, because technically, you don't own your money. The BTC on your wallet can. Nobody is stopping huge money movements with AML, ATF, business days or bank holidays.";2;1;False;TheLXK;dufbzrr;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"Isn't the whole idea of Bitcoin that it's a ""decentralized digital money"" that is ""issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever"". Wouldn't that kinda go against the idea of what you call ""decades of regulation""? Also, there are quite enough bitcoin derivatives I think. Ethereum, Ropple, Cardano, Stellar, Litecoin and so on. And you talk about how winning the trust of the public is a trivial step, but it couldn't be further from the truth. 

I'm not going to talk about whether the financial institutions are overpowered or not, but I will say that your goal, which is a stable currency, does indeed require it to be, as you said, ""stable, low-volatile"". This, however, goes against the wishes of, I would say, the vast majority of CC holders since they don't want stability, they want a currency that skyrockets and makes them millionaires when they sell it at just the right time. 

Sure, maybe a lot of the early backers were keen on your idea, but Bitcoin is de facto never going to be a currency since those involved don't want it to be, and likely never will.";3;1;False;WhoNeedsFacts;duf1dq7;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

But it is not more secure to have it on an exchange. An exchange can get hacked, seized by authorities (BTC-e), shut down to where you can potentially lose your coins. Holding your own bitcoin in your personal wallet *is* the most secure, but also takes the most responsibility. ;1;1;False;tranceology3;duf8fm5;Ellen DeGeneres Just Introduced Bitcoin to Her 3 Million US Viewers;7xz6ww;http://bitcoinist.com/ellen-degeneres-introduced-bitcoin-viewers/
"Right, for some people. People who are really into the tech and the security. But what about total noobs or tech illiterate?

What is more secure? A ""password"" that once it's lost your funds are gone and no one can recover them?

Or

One that can be recovered?

Either way you run the risk of being hacked. Who do you think is more likely to be hacked, coinbase or your aunt Erma? I think Erma is the more likely victim. Now when you start asking Erma or some sketchy exchange it gets a little tougher to decide...
