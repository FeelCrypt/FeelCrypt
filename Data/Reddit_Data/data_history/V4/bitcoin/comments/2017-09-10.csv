I know this is hard for you to wrap your head around, that people might be motivated by things that aren't specifically about economics, but that's just the way some of us roll.

""I'd never completely give up smoking"" is a dumb thing to say, much dumber than what OP said, and if you're one of these people who believes smoking doesn't actually make you sick you're the intellectual equivalent of skinny-fat. Stupid-smart? I dunno.

"> Not because of deflation, but despite deflation

ahh ""despite""... you are free to believe that, but inflation is and remains a drag on growth, no matter what you believe ;)

> Switzerland is actively trying to curb the inflow of foreign capital.

so actively that they are failing to do it... a willing central bank can print its way to devaluation, but somehow Swiss central bank is not. what a weird thing, don't you agree?

sry but i dont have historical data on hand.

anyway a country can grow despite inflation (even if it grows less in the long run) so if 30 years ago Swiss had inflation this proves nothing besides Swiss grew less than it could. 
on the contrary the fact that Swiss is growing now with deflation disproves the bogus arguments of ""onky donky deflationary death spiral"" and ""people skip purchases when the currency is deflationary""

i pardon your sarcasm, dont worry. 

i suggest, if you have time, you plot the net per capita wealth today in developed countries with the cumulative rate of inflation in the given country during the last 30 - 40 years.

"From the first article it doesn't seem that weak demand was a function of deflation, but rather resulted from other factors such as demographic trends e.g. a shrinking population due to low birth rates over the past 30 years.

The investopedia article's claim uses the 1929 crash and ensuing depression as an example. But that was a sudden event so of course, if the money supply suddenly shrunk which it did the consequences will be bad. No one knew in advance how many dollars were in circulation and no one could prepare in advance for a traumatic event. The situation is completely different with Bitcoin: all actors know in advance the full extent of the money supply and can't really be taken by surprise. In fact, this is a much better situation because the correct information reaches all market participants allowing them to prepare in advance for a market event. Apples to oranges.

Hoarding is fine because no one hoards for its own sake. Hoarders are interested in eventually spending their money (otherwise there's no point in holding on to money!). They're just waiting for the best opportunity to spend their money i.e. they want to make the best possible investment. There's no value in pointlessly spending money as that wouldn't contribute to economic productivity. Hoarders in fact are doing the best thing for the economy: they're waiting for the best possible investment opportunity (the most efficient enterprise to invest in) that will justify them spending their money.

It's so simple and fundamental that inflation vs deflation doesn't actually change it. This is a neutral point. Doesn't prove or disprove anything. Seriously. All the things you said apply to both scenarios.

Jesus god damn. I'm not saying demand will completely disappear. When I say discourage, I mean encourage a little less. I don't mean, completely dismantle the car industry and all demand completely disappears. You need to learn to think beyond all or nothing, there are numbers in between. Stop thinking in extremes. I'm not saying it's the end of the world, I'm saying it's less good.

"I'm aware that population birth rates moderate and even begin to decline in rich societies. But the problem with Japan is much more severe than that, and it has been discussed widely. There is more to it than just a simple trend that happens among all rich nations. Much of it has been attributed to the fact that there is an entire generation of men who have been unable to hold a steady, long-term job. This is a situation where you have to look at more than just the numbers, although even the numbers would suggest that there is more at play here than a simple trend that all wealthy nations go through.

As it relates to deflation, maybe you'd be better served reading and debating the economists then on this topic. There is widespread agreement on this topic, and it's heavily researched, as you can tell just from how this question was phrased:

"A declining population isn't the result of a bad economy. On the contrary, first world countries tend to experience declining birth rates precisely because they are doing well economically, so women can choose careers over family life. It's a well documented demographics phenomenon:

">Free markets doesn't mean unregulated markets.

yes it does. where did you find this silly notion that regulated markets are free? :O

> ideological purity is a more extreme stance than trying to blend the best of multiple ideologies into a compromise. 

you either are free or you are not. if you compromise on freedom you are no longer free. and we have all witnessed in the past decades what happens when we start compromising on freedom, don't we. it's a downhill road. 

> When you take freedom to the extreme, it results in lack of freedom.

ehm, this is just your opinion and it's wrong...

> Should I be free to own slaves? A class of ultrawealthy individuals can make that happen unless some power opposes them.

so let me see how your argument works out: you are afreaid that someone could be turned into slavery so you are willing to surrender yourself and your fellow men into voluntary servitude? ehm, no thanks. i prefer to be free and take my chances in a free society rather than being a slave in a socialist society.

> Today, government is the one I distrust the least. 

you seem a fool to me. government is evil

> If wealth concentration gets too high, the powers that control the wealth controls your freedom.

this is just your opinion and i cant even begin to understand why you believe it

>I believe it's ok for someone to be fabulously wealthy, but that initial wealth should be taxed

so to be uberwealthy with 100 is dangerous but to be uberwealthy with 40 it is not? weird statement

>  I believe that markets and capitalism are powerful and useful forces

so powerful and useful that you want government to regulate the market.. this is another inconsistency in your reasoning

> Government and bureaucracy is inefficient, but if you value freedom and transparency that inefficiency + slowness is the price you pay.

ehm no! in countries where government is smaller people are more free and more rich. this is hard data, and can't be questioned

> I don't advocate for pure socialism.

there is no such thing as an impure socialism. you either redistribute wealth or you do not. Funny thing is socialists always want to redistribute other people's wealth, never their own...

why don't you propose to redistribute only the wealth belonging to fellow socialists instead of everybody's wealth?

why should my wealth be redistributed if i don't believe in socialism? when socialists will stop to redistribute my wealth i'll stop calling socialism evil

> some of the advantages of socialism

as far as i know socialism has no advantages, just disadvantages.

you have a lot of opinions which are not supported by facts as far as i'm aware";0;1;False;Miky06;dmtniud;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
"if your investment is good you will find a loan even at a rate of 10% or 15%

on the other hand a questionable investment will not be undertook and this is a net positive for the economy.

every investment consumes wealth. a good investment pays back with more wealth, a bad one just destroy your resources so you should not do it.

it's simple.

> If the prices are constantly falling, producers have less incentive to produce.

this is bogus. producers produce if there is demand. when prices are low demand grows. how many cars would you buy for 1 billion each? and how many card would you buy for 1$ each?

would you not buy a car for 1$ if that same car is going to be priced at 0.96$ the next year?
