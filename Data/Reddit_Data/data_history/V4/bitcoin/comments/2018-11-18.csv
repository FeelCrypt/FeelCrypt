">So the crux of your libertarianism is that you like freedom where it ought to exist?

Well of course that's what everyone in the world wants, we just disagree on what qualifies as ""ought to"".

>And if course, there's no such thing as a libertarian who supports UBI. It requires consider state intervention in the economy where it takes on a physical wealth distribution function

Now you've gone from straw man to no true Scotsman.  Are you going for logical fallacy bingo?

The world isn't black and white, it is many shades of gray.  Nothing is absolute and nothing changes overnight.  You can't try to change the world all at once.  Baby steps.

The state already intervenes in so many ways.  UBI is better than minimum wage as it has less market distorting effects.  UBI is better than welfare because it doesn't cut if when you get work.  Perhaps charity isn't enough to support those in need, and there is no way that society will allow them to be completely ignored.  I could say that everyone should be free to do what they want and fuck you to those born with medical or mental problems, but that isn't going to get us anywhere.

Personally, I'm doing quite well, so I don't need charity or minimum wage or welfare or UBI, so maybe get rid of them all if that makes you happy.  Me, I'm ok with society demanding a bit more.  Perhaps I'm not libertarian enough for you, whatever that means.

>That is like saying you're a vegetarian but also like chicken

No, it is like saying that everyone should be vegetarian, but if you are going to eat meat then chicken is better than beef and pork.  Or it's like being a vegetarian instead of a vegan even though you are against animal cruelty and imprisonment.  A vegan might say that you aren't really against animal cruelty because egg hens aren't treated well.  An omnivore might say the same.  Does that mean you don't belong in the anti animal cruelty sub?

Today we have far more efficient ways to transfer gold that don't even include government intervention so it would not be economically bad, especially if you relate that to all the other awful economic ventures our government takes part in. China, turkey, Germany, and Russia have recently pulled all there gold reserves to bring back home instead of overseas holding. They do not trust the the US dollar and they most definitely do not trust Bitcoin. Gold is intrinstic because you can hold it in your hands not because you can't fucking eat it. It is an object that has a set amount of mass on the Earth. Never more, never less. When the dollar loses all of its value, I'd rather have my trusted bank to store gold for me rather than dollars. Unless complete anarchy spews and its impossible for me to get ( which is personally why my gold is locked up on my property ) Also, society doesn't have to collapse for the dollar bill to collapse. This next financial disaster will cause alot of people to rethink everything, and hopefully we turn to the people that have been predicting this for so long.  The can has been kicked far enough. Lastly my friend, Bitcoin will go to zero during the collapse and has a zero percent chance of ever growing exponentially. Cash out while you can ( if you own any at all ) and buy gold or silver. ;1;1;False;MajorOakSummit;e9x9f4n;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg
"The gold standard was a bad idea economically.  It cost the governmemt an absurd amount to maintain a gold supply.  The only reason to hold gold (as a government) is if faith in your currency is weak and you need to set a floor in value.

Gold has little intrinisic value-- as I said, it has no purpose beyond jewelery and industrial applications.  You can't eat it, you can't make it into effective tools, and it is an inferior currency.  And if a bank is holding your gold, they're the real owners in any situtation where the U.S. dollar (and treasury bills) lose most of their value.  If they don't,  well, you're not so much storing value as setting in a loss of real value.

U.S. bonds are backed by faith in the U.S. government.  They have more value than gold in any situation where society does not collapse. I agree that gold is a safer store of value than bitcoin, but at least bitcoin has a chance of gaining an exponential amount of value";3;1;False;Reus958;e9x5bnh;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

While there are other mechanisms that physically transfering gold, at the end of the day you're either holding the gold or holding a certificate worth gold.

>China, turkey, Germany, and Russia have recently pulled all there gold reserves to bring back home instead of overseas holding. 

It's a natural part of national security, especially when 2 of those regimes are at risk of falling foul of the international community and the other is the economic leader of europe

>They do not trust the the US dollar and they most definitely do not trust Bitcoin. 

What a government trusts and what an individual trusts are different.


>Gold is intrinstic because you can hold it in your hands not because you can't fucking eat it. It is an object that has a set amount of mass on the Earth. 

Intrinsic value isn't just due to rarity, it's also due to use.  What makes gold different than a dozen other metals of similar concentrations as ""stores of value""? Only that its shiny.

>When the dollar loses all of its value, I'd rather have my trusted bank to store gold for me rather than dollars. 

Yeah, because your bank is going to keep holding that gold for you in exchange for now worthless money.  No way they'll start using that gold to start paying for expenses, or completely fold during the period of economic ruin that would lead up to the dollar ""los[ing] all its value"".

>Unless complete anarchy spews and its impossible for me to get ( which is personally why my gold is locked up on my property )

What's the value of gold if there's complete anarchy? Not much. Not more than guns and bullets and food.

> Also, society doesn't have to collapse for the dollar bill to collapse. This next financial disaster will cause alot of people to rethink everything, and hopefully we turn to the people that have been predicting this for so long.  The can has been kicked far enough. 

Everyone knows that financial cycles are part of keneysian economics.  It's still better than the thoroughly debunked Austrian economies that value deflationary currencies.

>Lastly my friend, Bitcoin will go to zero during the collapse and has a zero percent chance of ever growing exponentially. Cash out while you can ( if you own any at all ) and buy gold or silver. 

Yeah, if there's a collapse, bitcoin will be worthless, cash will be worthless and gold will have a small value.  Instead of planning for economic ruin, though, I'm working to pay off debt and buy a house with land that I can enjoy crash or not.  If there was a crash though, you'd be better off with bullets and canned food in addition to a means of food production than a shiny rock.  Hell, salt is a mineral that's necessary to life, currently dirt cheap, and has intrinsic value as a nutrient and food preservative. You'd be better off with that.";2;0;False;Reus958;e9xqmpc;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg
Actually, the main opposition to the US constitution was people that were more libertarian than them. The articles of confederation were more libertarian . ;1;0;False;Fedacking;e9ymlp4;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg
