"What makes a bubble a bubble if it can never pop?

Either way, as I said, Bitcoin's bubble or not-bubble is extraordinary. Its growth has been mostly constant over the long term when you look at the last 7 years, with the current ""correction"" barely registering: https://imgur.com/a/RXXA3. People often forget about that because they barely heard about Bitcoin before last year, yet its growth was actually incredibly much faster between 2011 and 2014.

It doesn't compare at all to the patterns observed for the dotcom bubble, which was extremely short lived in comparison, and which growth accelerated before the crash, rather than slowing down dramatically: http://awscdn.streetauthority.net/sites/default/files/ckeditor-images/05-01-14%20SADChart1.jpg. The tulipmania didn't even last a year.

Hence if it's a bubble, it's definitely one of its kind.

edit: Now if we go by this definition of bubble, ""A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction."", then we have to base ourselves on something to determine what a rapid escalation is. Perhaps cryptocurrencies are creating a new paradigm, and current's growth isn't fast by comparison to how fast it has been in the past. If we call the current growth ""rapid"", then we have to call the whole growth a rapid escalation of prices, and a contraction would mean Bitcoin going back to sub-dollar levels.";0;0;False;Max_Thunder;dssdjfz;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

But I agree, Bitcoin is definitely an interesting one. Both economically and psychologically as well as a good example in how marketing works. I've been following it for quite some time now and what has baffled me the most is how absolutely no one seems to know why they're buying. Even those who seems to know a bit about Bitcoin ultimately doesn't have any reasons for their valuations when you press them a bit on the subject -- most simply shows a chart of previous performance and uses that as a reason for the future performance of the price, which is obviously completely insane. Right now it seems to have just been hype pushing the price up, which generates more hype which means more people want in which pushes the price even more up etc. But it looks like Bitcoin is now starting to run out of new buyers and thus new money.

"The key difference is in the volatility. If a company lost 20% of its stock overnight, it would be chaos. That's a year or several years worth of slow sustained growth gone down the drain.

For Bitcoin, 20% swings overnight in either direction aren't that uncommon, so it's tough to call them crashes and recoveries. Everyone invested knows that this is a volatile market, a ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" type of investment. 

So you have to look towards its (relatively) long term growth: it's down close to 50% on the month and there's no real ETA on when buyers who got in at 15k will get their money back. We're still waiting on the recovery from the 19.2k pop, that was supposed to have happened by now.

"i mean... if you can exist without a car, that's great and all, but having a car is great... especially for dating, girls do not want to be with a guy who doesn't drive most the time in america. Like once a girl hits 16 or 17, one of the most important things to her is the dude can drive. when a female hits 19-21, they care about the apartment, but a car is still important to have too.

also, 12/E an hour is near min wage in your country?
that's insane... min wage in my country has been in the 8usd range for the past few years.... i'd consider 12usd an hour to still be a low wage, but i wouldn't call it ""near min wage"". because you are still making 30-40% more then min wage, depending on your state. in less populated states min wage is even lower, but costs are much cheaper as well.

the fact you can get an apartment on 400E makes me jealous af.... i'd had to work 2 jobs 50-60 hours a week just to barely afford to live on my own in a 1bed 1 bath apartment, lowest prices being like 1100 near me... newer apartments are like 1200-1300.

tbh america's min wage is bullshit... you can't live on min wage without working 80+ hours a week, or living with someone else to split bills. and it's not exactly easy to convince a girl to date you and move out with you when you both making low wages and you still live at home since it's the only option.

"> The thing is you don’t have to know how bitcoin works to use it. Just get some in your account and you can do what you want.

Yes, but that wont stop people from not knowing how it works or how to use it. Its not a very good currency if there is a limit of what you can purchase with it.

> So that leaves stability. The US dollar has dealt with 2275% inflation over 100 years, it’s been relatively stable, but $5 has not and will not always be worth $5. I suppose you could say that a currency has to be within a certain level of stability, but no one argued that confederate dollars weren’t ‘real currency’ when they were in use, or Zimbabwe or Russian currency.

2275% inflation over 100 years is a lot different then a 10% change over a *day* inflation is kept in control for the most part, most places aim for 1-3% inflation. It also helps that 100 years ago the systems in place were probably a lot more bunk and prone to things like crazy high inflation. If USD changed by that much on the daily a lot of things would pretty much implode, things like selling a car would be ridiculous.

Fees aren’t bad tech, nor are lack of fees good tech. Fees are a reflection of the supply relative to the demand, and fees will always be high when the demand for transactions approaches or exceeds the supply of transaction space. Other coins have cheap fees because their demand is low, BTC has expensive fees because its demand is high relative to its transaction space. Stop talking about fees and start talking about tech and supply. Does any other coin have the tech to handle the transaction volume of Bitcoin while offering the same desirable attributes of bitcoin, like security and decentralization? The answer is definitively no. BTC is barely handling that traffic, yes. Everyone knows this, but if you saddled our transaction volume on fucking Monero it would crash overnight.;2;0;False;greyhoundfd;dsqs6z8;But can Bitcoin do this?;7qke93;https://i.imgur.com/GehwmFI.png

"oh man. Are you new to Bitcoin? you ask tough questions that I've seen many times everywhere on the internet. 

http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=why+is+bitcoin+valuable

But yeah it's possible for other coins, in some alternate reality. And that's what they have sub reddits. I think the arguments and merits as well as actual use cases + speculation provide enough reason for me to believe in it. I don't know some crazy secret; I just look at the trends. I also think about the concepts, look at the code and who/what are investing in it as well as it's use case so far. None of this is secret or hard to Google. Bitcoin is decentralized but also it's commits/decisions for updates are run by a form of meritocracy into the source code. That's fundamentally different from almost every other altcoin. Also, most ICO and alts have source code that looks like it was written by a noob in his off hours. Or they're domineered by insiders and have questionable corporate relationships that are antithetical to Bitcoin's philosophy of decentralization (e.g. Bitcoin Cash).

But I also have to ask: why see you suddenly here? to shill for BCash/alts and downvote?

Ignoring that, remember time frames. Having this conversation is the equivalent of some peasants in the 100s having this conversation

Peasant 1: Hey, have you heard of those new Roman Denarii they're issuing?
Peasant 2: Yeah, they've got fixed values supposedly, and they're universal so you can use them to buy a blanket from the weaver AND milk from the herdsman
Peasant 1: Well yeah, but the barter economy is clearly superior. Why use iron to make coins for an exchange when I could just keep it and have MORE iron to barter with?

Yes, everyone knows the transaction fees are annoying, but this technology is still developing and the problems will be fixed by solutions that are literally just around the corner. Just be patient, stop expecting the tech of the 2040s today. Transactions cost money. We can bring the cost down but if you want a free method of transferring money for purchases that also is secure, private, instant, global, and has a fixed supply, you need to be patient.

Turns into a good amount of what money again? The fact that your using the dollar as a means to measure growth proves alot. You can't buy goods using Bitcoin anymore, if it is worthless as a currency why does it have value? Doesn't make a lot of sense. Only thing that can save it now is LN, but that may take years to bear fruit, as was proven with Segwit. Just look at the Bitcoin convention that was forced to stop taking payments. As of right now, Bitcoin isn't in a great state. ;-1;2;False;;dsqqduo;But can Bitcoin do this?;7qke93;https://i.imgur.com/GehwmFI.png

The majority of people who are investing in BTC right now are just investing in an ""asset class"", they are buying it for dollars and its value is measured in terms of dollars, pretty much like that of stocks. Substitute stocks, bonds, land or real estate for bitcoin and tell me how is it different? BTC is actually heading towards the same oblivion where tech stocks did in 1999, or dow jones did in the 2008 home loan crisis. Not to sound gloomy and all, but as you said, it will be only foolish at this stage to invest money in cryptos that you can't afford to lose.

"i struggle when i find out that i'm part of this. i bought in years ago, have experienced great returns in many ways and even sold some for the first time a month ago. 

during that time i always thought, ""i'm willing to see this go back to 4-5k or even lower.""

now that the sentiment has clearly shifted (maybe just for the shortterm), i feel some reality sitting in. i bought most of my alts below the top, however, i remember selling previous alts I had at rock bottom after I bought in much higher because ""they aren't going anywhere.""

Basically, i'm not smarter than the market, i know i've invested in ""some"" shitcoins hoping for a buck, with the vast majority of my holdings in strong coins. But, I can't help but have the instinct to buy at virtually any dip when I should wait until the price actually hits levels that are much smarter for the longterm.

"I was in the crypto space back in 2009, when it was pretty much entirely Ancaps and cyberpunks. And although I respect the tenacity of this community, especially those who aren't doing to this to get rich quick but because they believe in being a part of forming a new global economy. I just want you all to understand how ignorant some of you sound in terms of ""investing"". I remember a guy who said he was going to keep buying X asset even as it was in free fall for the last few weeks, simply because he believe it was inevitable for it to go back up. History isn't always a good measure for the future and random, things happen. I do believe bitcoin has the ability to go up from here but please be careful people, don't be taking leans against your homes in order to dump $300k into bitcoin, please don't give up everything you have in hopes of being rich. I sincerely believe a lot of you have been exposed to investing in assets because of crypto and should take a lot of your knowledge and begin to invest in other markets. You might not be in your 20's, a millionaire with a lambo, but if you take the same concept of hodling into putting money into stocks over the course of your life, you will retire a millionaire. That has and will be guaranteed unless nuclear war happens. The same rules apply, buy the dips. Best wishes to all and I really believe there's more to this bitcoin roller coaster, just wanted to let others know that there is tons of markets to invest in outside of crypto and I think a lot of you would do well in said markets.

"Not OP but for bitcoin to become cash it needs to have short to medium term price stability at least. That’s the only way you’re going to get mass adoption. 

I’m fairly certain what my grocery bill in fiat in a month but can’t predict within a 25% range what it will be in bitcoin in a currency he next few days. That’s a serious problem. Half the world at least lives pay check to pay check on fiat. Although fiat may depreciate over time they have confidence that they can budget on it month to month. They can’t take the risk that their cash will depreciate by even 5% in a month let alone a day. Especially when there is a short term stable and widely accepted and government enforced alternative available already in their bank account. 

Yes it could stabilise over time as adoption increases but you need mass adoption for stability. And you need stability for mass adoption. As long as it’s more volatile than fiat in short to medium term, the hurdle to become cash seems practically insurmountable to me. 

Although I hope I’m wrong. I would like to see an unregulated form of cash. But with the hurdle described above, it might never be bitcoin or any crypto for that matter. ";5;2;False;Speaking-of-segues;dsr9r3a;Current Bitcoin Sentiment.;7qor5q;https://i.redd.it/zd3ygblm0ca01.jpg

"Probably nothing fresh about these but these are the main problems I see:

* No clean way to buy it. The exchanges are barely regulated and untrustworthy and constantly doing scummy things to solidify that image. E.g. shutting down when the market starts to go down, getting hacked, locking accounts, straight up disappearing, having massive price discrepancies, eating massive profits of exchanges, ridiculous fees, weeks to get set up. I never appreciated how banks conduct themselves till I dealt with bitcoin exchanges.
* Unusable as a currency. Caused by volatility and in turn lack of adoption. This problem seems to be getting worse as well.
* Unacceptable fees and transaction processing times. Some promise of this getting better in the future.
*  Zero consumer protection. No way to protect yourself or recover your loses if your computer got hacked or you lost the USB your private keys were in... even if that contained your life savings.

"I disagree. Bitcoin has never been about creating a new currency but a new currency system, independent of trust and national interest. It's about ""breaking the government monopoly on money"".

Physical currencies once required the gold standard to remain stable but now they are most commonly backed by trust in the ""word"" of a government. Bitcoin has acted and continues to act as the 'gold standard' for the entire cryptocurrency market. It doesn't act like gold, it acts like a commodity.... nobody wants to use that analogy because a commodity is something with intrinsic value  but the value of gold not related to its physical utility, so analogy to gold as a commodity is pretty apt.

Bitcoin creates fungibility in the entire cryptocurrency market and making bitcoin easily spendable would have big effects. Bitcoin has an important macroeconomic role to play in establishing a completely new way for a global currency market to function and focusing on its inability to process microtransactions is extremely myopic.

The following is from wikipedia

>According to research produced by the Bank of Canada, the emerging Bitcoin economy has many similarities with the economy based on gold standard, in particular:[90][91]

>* limited and predictable supply of the anchor of the monetary system
>* no central bank or monetary authority controls the supply
low or non-existent inflation
>* virtually no arbitrage costs for international transactions
>* Governments have less control over their domestic economies
>* Governments lose seigniorage revenues that they obtain from the ability to almost costlessly create money

>Edward Hadas and Michael Hiltzik noted that monetary systems based on Bitcoin and gold have some similar disadvantages:

>* independence from government
>* price declines
>* less spending during crisis times

>George Gilder, a proponent of gold standard, proposed breaking ""the government monopoly on money"" by using a combination of Bitcoin for the internet and treating gold in tax terms as currency.

">I have issue with the statement. Govenments only give things value in what they(the government) can provide.

Most fundamentally it is physical protection from aggression of others. The US military expenditures basically ensure the stability of the world. It's called hegemonic stability theory.

>The currency itself is meaningless, and in fact dangerous when left in the sole hands of governments(the aggressors in war).

It's not, there are checks and balances.

The US government is already a distributed solution to the N-Generals problem via the House, the Senate, the Executive, the Courts, and theoretically in practice now the Military since we have a standing Army.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is a hybrid public-private partnership which acts in the interests of the people with investment from the banking sector, and under the ultimate control of the civilian government.

>They can spend infinite amounts of money with no regard to whether that expenditure is beneficial or not(see war profiteering),

No... all spending is given consideration to ultimate net effect.

Are there winners and losers? Yes, but your alternative is a existential threat to our system without any suggestion of viable alternative.

>literally inflating away the savings of the people at the expense of human lives. 

Savings is not intended to be stored in a savings account. The idea is that surplus value should be reinvested in the economy, rather than extracted. If you want low risk solutions, there are Inflation Protected Securities which return certain basis points over inflation. 

>This is why people have chosen throughout history to store their value outside of governments(see gold, land, art, precious stones, etc). 

None of these are outside of governments. Are you kidding me? Gold was confiscated during WWII. Land is subject to fee-simple title, not allodial title. Art is often used for money laundering, but its not legal and you get fucked if you get caught. Same with precious stones.

You're just talking about some of the many regulated asset classes whose values have risen for a number of reasons, one of which is inflation (the others are a shit ton more people with longer life expectancies and fewer wars, meaning greater demand for every physical asset and things like art become more valuable over time — rare masterpieces weren't rare in their time).

Remember people lose Bitcoin Keys all the time. Imagine the day when despite there being just under 21 million Bitcoins in existence,  there are only a few hundred in circulation because we lost the rest.

>Governments always abuse their powers of monopoly.

No they don't. Where is the case for this?

>In my entire adult life I have never been able to vote for someone who will actually promote peace, so now I'm doing it with my pocketbook.

What does peace have to do with this? Why would you want peace? Are you nuts? As an American we're 300 million people in a world of over 7 billion yet we use 25% of the natural resources. Are standard of living and way of life is incompatible with peace. We use our military to develop and establish the freedoms, luxuries, and powers we enjoy.

>so now I'm doing it with my pocketbook.

Be careful. Governments will ban these types of asset classes— or there will be other asymmetric attacks on them and their users. It represents an existential threat to our government, as to me, personally anti-American and treasonous.

The US government can blacklist any transactions being made to the blockchain, shut down the servers, and freeze all real world assets of any users they can identify.

This will also lead to a white-list-only internet, meaning no encryption without knowing who a transmission is occurring between and what the nature of that signal is.

>Fuck fiat, crypto is for the people,

Crypto is even more concentrated than the fiat monetary supply, and not based on any intrinsic value. It is not for the people.

>crypto is for peace.

No other of the 195 nations globally contributes to global peace, huh?  Those 7.3 billion other people only stay peaceful because of an omnipotent US Government?  Lets be real; the reason for relative global stability is Nuclear deterrence.

>It's not, there are checks and balances.
The US government is already a distributed solution to the N-Generals problem via the House, the Senate, the Executive, the Courts, and theoretically in practice now the Military since we have a standing Army.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is a hybrid public-private partnership which acts in the interests of the people with investment from the banking sector, and under the ultimate control of the civilian government.

The federal reserve is run by large bank owners who have absolute power over the pocketbook.  There is no real partnership.  They are all former bankers with ties to large spending contracts(See Governor Powell and the Carlyle group)  They have not received an Audit, actively lobbying against the efforts in the earlier 2010's for that exact action.

>Savings is not intended to be stored in a savings account. The idea is that surplus value should be reinvested in the economy, rather than extracted. If you want low risk solutions, there are Inflation Protected Securities which return certain basis points over inflation. 

Savings can be anything a person believes will retain its value.  Savings, and money in general, is all simply perception, and agreed upon use and value.

>None of these are outside of governments. Are you kidding me? Gold was confiscated during WWII. Land is subject to fee-simple title, not allodial title. Art is often used for money laundering, but its not legal and you get fucked if you get caught. Same with precious stones.

I know.  I definitely fear my government.  I was in the army for 6 years, so I know that if Uncle Sam wants something, there's very little you can do to stop him.  

>Remember people lose Bitcoin Keys all the time. Imagine the day when despite there being just under 21 million Bitcoins in existence, there are only a few hundred in circulation because we lost the rest.

Yeah, but its infinitely divisible, so if there were only a few coins left, we'd just deal with smaller and smaller donominations, ad infinitum.

>No they don't. Where is the case for this?

Pretty much every government up to modern history?  Repression of the rights of the people by way of force is a government tradition since governments first came into being.  They have exclusive rights to the use of force, and they use it to promote the perceived virtues and social customs of the time.  Problem is, if I'm gay, or a pacifist, or like sex before marriage or in some percieved deviant fashion, or speak critically of the current regime, those are all threats to those customs and are subject to that government force.

>What does peace have to do with this? Why would you want peace? Are you nuts? As an American we're 300 million people in a world of over 7 billion yet we use 25% of the natural resources. Are standard of living and way of life is incompatible with peace. We use our military to develop and establish the freedoms, luxuries, and powers we enjoy.

I'm just short of a pacifist, so everything I do, I try to do to promote peace.  To me, this is following my moral compass.  I believe wanton destruction and killing at the expense of other nations is immoral.  I see our use of resources as a serious imbalance with our global neighbors, and if we want true stability and peace in the world, then we need to lead by example and not by force.  We use so much global resource because we offer high quality goods and services as a means of exchange.  The rest of the world can do this as well, though IMO, the reason many of them struggle is because most have not been able to maintain a free, representative governments, whether through internal issues(much of Africa), or outsider influence(much of South America).

>Be careful. Governments will ban these types of asset classes— or there will be other asymmetric attacks on them and their users. It represents an existential threat to our government, as to me, personally anti-American and treasonous.

This will also lead to a white-list-only internet, meaning no encryption without knowing who a transmission is occurring between and what the nature of that signal is.

Again, I know.  But there would need to be worldwide consensus on the banning of all crypto and a concerted effort to destroy it as a means of transfer amongst criminals, and I just don't believe that will happen.  Why is this Anti-American?  I still puchase all my goods in America.  Work my job in America.  I simply choose not to use the US dollar as a store of value.  Why is that un-American?  And as for a white-list only internet, no encryption future....  I think you're looking to an Orwellian future.  I don't believe it, but I can't convince you otherwise.

>Crypto is even more concentrated than the fiat monetary supply, and not based on any intrinsic value. It is not for the people.

Your average consumer is rationally more concerned about their ability to eat next month than they are about whether that thing they are using to buy food with slowly falls over time or might be subject to a currency crisis in the next month. 

If you refuse to believe this is an issue then I’m ok with that. That is my genuine major concern. You can’t get from A to Z without going through B. You’re talking about Z. I’m worried that getting to B C D or E may be practically impossible. ";6;0;False;Speaking-of-segues;dsrbj33;Current Bitcoin Sentiment.;7qor5q;https://i.redd.it/zd3ygblm0ca01.jpg

"Agreed. I think its better than gold since the limited manufacturing use is not what gold gets value from but its properties that make it HODLable and trade able and divisible ect. 

1 and 4 are just a matter of increased adoption. 

1. Generally Accepted - Many people must accept the money as a settlement of debt or as a discharge of obligation.

2. Durable - Its quality/value does not deteriorate over time, which is why we do not tend to use food products as money.

3. Divisible - If you divide the money in half, each half should be worth 50% of the whole. This is why we tend not to use diamonds or artwork as money.

4. Stable/Consistent - The value does not fluctuate substantially with time.

5. Transportable - It is easy to move from one place to another.

6. Scarce - It is difficult to acquire.""";1;0;False;smokeyjoe69;dsr71ms;Current Bitcoin Sentiment.;7qor5q;https://i.redd.it/zd3ygblm0ca01.jpg

I think it makes an interesting point. Counterpoint though, once we get a cryptocurrency that is usable as a unit of account by itself, THEN you can't buy or futures it away in a unit of account that's slipping.

Example - if you have a futures market against bitcoin, and your money is the Zimbabwae dollar, well ..... I guess you could short bitcoin and make more .... Zim dollars. But eventually, you have lots of Zim dollars and no bitcoin.

"Mostly agree, though I disagree that it was never about ""sticking it to the man"" as it was put, I think it definitely was about that, for a while, to a sizeable portion of people buying and using bitcoin.  I think that still is *one* appeal of it to a lot of people currently using bitcoin.

However, I will add that you're delusional if you think the governments of the world won't manage to regulate crypto currencies.  They will.  It's just that they'll be forced to give up a lot of territory in order to be able to do it, which they'll be willing to do because some control is better than none.  It's not black and white.  They *can* regulate this stuff to some degree, just not as much as traditional government-backed currencies.

Crypto currency is an improvement, therefore it *will* become more widely adopted, it will appeal to people (because it's better, that's the definition of an ""improvement"": it's something *better* than what you had before) and that will entice those people to buy and use it.

Improvements come in steps, they tend to be smaller, sometimes marginal.  No one change or improvement rarely, if ever, causes a complete 180, pushes things all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum.  *Of course* crypto's aren't going to be this completely unregulated, untouchable-by-the-governments-of-the-world-muahahaha, by-and-for-the-people-yay! currency.  What nonsense, what naive nonsense.

But they *will* be a lot closer to that than traditional, government-backed currencies like the dollar and euro are.  That is what we call ""an improvement"", and when you have a choice between something and something else that's better, what do you choose?  The thing that's better.";22;2;False;Andrew_Tracey;dsrhk0y;In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.;7qr5a9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/

"There is no ""greater good"" though. OP wrote:

>it is about protesting the monetary system you have been forced to use

This is bullshit. The ""crypto system"" is pretty much the same than the monetary system and it's the wild west of currency as well. 

The technology behind it is great, but the way it is applied isn't. In the end, it just shifts a few things here and there and creates the *feeling* of some sort of ""protest"" but crypto as is doesn't have the power to change anything fundamental about the system we live in. 

In order for change to happen, it would require visionaries within the community who are willing to push the limits and not only optimize the system but create something that can actually replace the current monetary system with a much more advanced system.

This is not the case, since the majority are conservatives who want to keep this going in order to make more profits as long as they can before things go south. The greed is real and it has become a big part within the crypto community.

If you don't believe me, just ask yourself this: what will happen if a major event results in the collapse of society? The current monetary system, economy, etc will collapse for sure. What will happen with crypto? Is it able to step in? No, because it relies on too many parameters to be of any value.

A superior system should be able to tank any major collapse and provide security even without electricity, paper or metals to trade and access funds despite the lack of technology. Crypto can not provide that. Maybe it never will - but that's what we need.

People focus too much on getting rich. That's why crypto is a fail. It's another short-sighted concept to secure short-term profits. Really sad, because the core concept has so much more potential.

Crypto is like a space craft that one could use to explore the universe for long-term benefits for humanity, but instead people decided to use it to get rich selling Earth-Moon travel tickets.";1;1;False;McLorpe;dsrmpsb;In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.;7qr5a9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/

"I couldn't disagree more with this sentiment. It seems as if you're trying to divorce cryptocurrency from it's cypherpunk origins. If you don't understand why this is revolutionary and could bring about an entirely new political and economic order I suggest you review more of the early work on why we did this in the first place.

For example watch this [video](http://www.deepcapture.com/2017/07/patrick-byrnes-cato-institute-luncheon-address-cryptocurrency-the-policy-challenges-of-a-decentralized-revolution/) from Patrick Byrne where he says ""For 6000 years humans have had this problem. We engage in consensual exchange, but you don't know me, you can't trust me, I can't trust you ... so there's a business model ... he who has the monopoly on violence in this area comes up with a gold coin puts his face on it and says I'll kill anybody who debases my gold coin. That's just a business model ... to monetize your monopoly on violence. We call that government ... For the first time in 6000 years we can have peer to peer exchange where trust is not an issue.""

Or [this](http://fennetic.net/irc/extropy/ext15.pdf) from Max Moore all the way back in 1995: ""Electronic cash and the competing currencies that would result from the denationalisation of money should be considered together. Both can reduce the power of government to tax and regulate, thereby freeing markets and increasing liberty and productivity.""

Or Ravikant's [tweet](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7sbz10d9P_elExBvN97N4w.png)

Or the crypto-anarchist [manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html)

Or maybe you understand the original motivation but think it's unrealistic? Again, I would suggest really trying to understand why an immutable, decentralized public consensus algorithm with a deflationary monetary policy (provided it can scale) would constitute a revolution and could replace the current monetary system (and perhaps governments) outright.

It's frustrating to me to see so many commentators who don't grok that the original impetus for doing this was based on a thesis that the current system is predicated on violence and can be rendered obsolete with crypto.

">that system allows EVERYONE to buy in

I can see how that system helps balance income equality. People who are so poor they don't have any savings (or only have debt) and people who were rich enough to buy hundreds of thousands of bitcoin when they were only a few dollars all get the same opportunity to share equally in the 10,000% gains of bitcoin. All shall prosper equally thanks to bitcoin.

Why would we want a currency that just keeps a steady value so there's no inherent advantage/disadvantage to being born after the time when the currency was at its all time cheapest, when we can have one that will turn 1,000 people into trillionaires so long as the rest of the world keeps paying higher and higher prices for smaller and smaller increments of bitcoin?

>Yes, a few got rich cause they believed it first

The people who believed in it first were the people who genuinely thought it was going to be a currency and spent 10,000 bitcoin on a pizza, and didn't realize its a terrible idea to use this currency to buy goods and services instead of just sitting on.

The people who have made the most money on bitcoin (the 0.00001%) are the people who were already rich and so could afford to buy up huge amounts of currency. It has nothing to do with how much you ""believe"" in it, its to do with how much you can afford to speculate on artificial scarcity.

"I wholeheartedly apologise for me tone. I've been deep diving into these things and the libertarian point of view, which a lot of crypto people share, frustrates me to no end. Sorry I took that frustration out on you.

In the friendly spirit of things let me relate to you an analogy that came to me:

A man eats extremely unhealthy gobbles up whatever comes in front of him and eats all the processed high sugar, high salt and high fat food he can get his hands on.

Obviously he develops serious problems and has a heart attack. The doctor gives him CPR and shocks him with the defibrillator and rescues him from death's door.

Oh btw this man is the sole bread winner of the family. Him dying would have led to the ruin of his family.

I mean, look, yes the man should be held responsible for his actions but letting him die hurts more people than just him. And saving him was the right thing to do in that moment. However both his family and his doctor should not have let it get so bad. And they should not let him eat like a madman post his operation either. (Which is what is going on in your link)

The family in this example is the common citizen, the man is the banks and the doctor the Fed. (If it wasn't clear)

1,000 people (0.00001% of the world population) own 20-40% of all bitcoin. Somewhere between 0.01 and 0.1% of people own any bitcoin at all.

you have an odd way of protesting income inequality if you think the answer is to buy into a system that allows a tiny percentage of ultra-rich people to make huge fortunes profiteering off controlling access to the money supply.

If these same people could just buy up billions of dollars and then make trillions as people had to pay them inflated prices to get access to a medium of exchange to run their lives, would you consider that a triumph for monetary policy?

Thankfully the future some people see where bitcoin is worth millions and is a mainstream currency will never happen and its only speculators getting duped, but it doesn't stop the sentiment (99.99% of people enriching a tiny elite in return for access to a medium of exchange) being a mean and petty one.";3;2;False;suninabox;dsrkj2e;In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.;7qr5a9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/

Whales were pumping altcoins during the past month and a half, which is by Bitcoin went stagnant. Whales do this with altcoins about every 8 months or so. Check out the all time BTC-DOGE chart. It's the clearest example of when this is happening.

The current dump in BTC price are whales lowering the price of BTC so they can switch back to it cheaper because they're finally through with pumping alts.

"Hi Diddy,

In early 2012, I downloaded Bitcoin-Qt and played with it.  Had somewhere around 50 BTC.  Decided if it ever truly threatened the monetary system, it would be outlawed.  Thought I had backed up my WALLET.DAT but unfortunately it was stored under C:\ProgramData, which I had not backed up.

Bitcoin is not just about investing, nor about protesting the monetary system, it is about [b]replacing it.[/b]  This will happen, is just in the very early stages right now.

The technologies that bitcoin brought together, especially peer to peer distributed ledger, can be applied to obsolete other central control structures as well, such as content silos like Facebook and Twitter, distributed search that is open and fair, providing people that create content more control over their data and better ways to monetize it.  These technologies will change the very fabric of society itself.  The technology, economic, and social climate is in a unique position to make that change.

My non-profit BTRIC (Blockchain Technologies Research Innovations Corporation) is doing it's part to help that happen.  It has a novel approach to incubating projects with good ideas into viable, top-shelf businesses.  Also doing the same for non-profit charitable causes.  Consider getting involved, either as a donor in our Founding Donor token fundraiser, by participating in our governance or other initiatives, or simply by spreading the word to others that you know feel the same way about Bitcoin and the tech and its potential to reshape the world.  Working together, we will do great things for the field, and also for society.  It's a unique opportunity in world history and we must make the most of it.

Best regards,
Ben";4;0;False;BTRIC;dsrnpa7;In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.;7qr5a9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/

"I got into BTC about 2010/2011 when I first heard about through word-of-mouth via University.

I thought the idea behind it was fantastic and as stated thought it would be a good way to stick two fingers up to ""the man"" and had some seriously interesting technology involved.

The first BTC I got was mail order (no idea how I didn't get scammed) and a physical exchange, absolute madness before exchanges (and Mt. Gox) were even a thing. I think I bought about $30 of weed using god-knows how many BTC at that time.

I went on to lose my wallet containing BTC through a mixture of idiocy & poor planning. Not much you can do there, live and learn.

What I did notice though is the community went from being very tech focused ""community"" driven .. to greed driven. Nothing but greed & people fucking other people over for money. I feel it lost its soul somewhere in the process.

"Don't hold your breath. BTC is not going to go back to those times. Maybe another currency will, but I doubt crypto in general will be like that. It's all about short-term profits now.

If anything, crypto will provide the foundation for another technology/development that will result in something far more useful (long-term). But crypto itself has basically reached the limit of its usefulness. Not because of its core features - because it does have lots of potential - but because of a community who doesn't care to go any further. 

There will be more forks and more optimizations, but that will be it. The lack of real visionaries is the real problem.

"**Falsifiability**

Statements, hypotheses, or theories have falsifiability or refutability if there is the possibility of testing or observing it to showcase how false or how true it is. They are falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which could negate them and in the corollary, conceive of an observation or an argument which proves them. Thus, the term falsifiability is synonymous to testability.

For example, the universal generalization that All swans are white is falsifiable since it is logically possible to falsify it by observing a single swan that is not white.

"I think there's a strong interplay between the price and the fundamentals. People originally got into it for fundamental asset protection and self-sovereignty properties. Perhaps the 2017 movement was driven simply by FOMO. In any case, consistent long-run price increases demonstrate divestiture from fiat into crypto - a trend that if continued will threaten and then supplant fiat. So if an economically rational actore buys today, they are expecting the price to go up in fiat-denominated terms (or equivalently for fiat to go bust). Given the prevalence of the never sell HODL meme, I would assume most are expecting long-run increases driven by fundamentals (ie asset protection and sovereignty).

As for wealth distribution, that just sounds like the Pareto principle which is probably perfectly natural in a free society. Estimates are that the top 1% owns 50% of the wealth (which I think could be lower than reality). There are also voluntary ways in which inequality problems can get resolved. People used to give money to charities and churches before it became the government's job to give everyone welfare. Just recently, someone gave Andreas ~ 80 BTC out of kindness. Smart contracts may enable new forms of voluntary social organization such as universal basic income schemes. DAOs may introduce efficiency gains whereby people need only work a few hours per week, removing the idea that ""unemployment"" is a bad thing. People would then be more free to exercise their own plastic genius on greater innovation.";2;0;False;leviself;dsrwsia;In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.;7qr5a9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/
