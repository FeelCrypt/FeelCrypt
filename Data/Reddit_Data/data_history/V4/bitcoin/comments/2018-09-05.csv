"I'm in it for the revolution, not money. And unlike even the bcash crowd, I like Roger. I have met him and always feel that we would be a dangerous team if we ever worked together. EVERYONE would hate us, we are both extreme in our view that everyone should take 100% responsibility for themselves and their lives.

I tail against totalitarian forces trying to control. The fascist tendencies behind the real powers behind bcash are frightening - and I ain't talking about roger.

The whole divide and conquer agenda starting with the fake 'block size debate' and ending in the failure of bcash originated in think tanks paid for by banksters trying to slow this bus down and seize control. They did slow the bus, but for the first time in history failed to dupe EVERYONE into their fear trap, just the bcash crowd.";1;0;False;flowbrother;e5ewo6q;Differences;9b7ytt;https://i.redd.it/7o3pfifob0j11.jpg
