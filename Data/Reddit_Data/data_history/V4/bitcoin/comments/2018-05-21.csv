"I could be totally off here, but I feel like I've found a pattern. Every thing in the image is oriented at one of five angles (roughly 0°, 30°, 60°, 300° and 330° for simplicity). There are also 12 numbers, 1 through 12 aligned at one of these angles. Now, draw lines cutting through these numbers at the same angle the number is aligned with. Then find bip-39 words on/close to the line which are also aligned at the same angle as the line (and naturally, the number our line is passing through).

I've encircled some words with pencil, also used the green line where some confusion arises. 

Arranging these words in order of 1-12. I've managed to find exactly 24 words (sometimes 26, if I included some words slightly away from these lines, like ""tree"" or ""hour""). In any case, it's still in the ballpark and I'm somewhat confident that this approach might not be entirely incorrect. 

Example of a seed I put together like this : 
either way   sign minimum key coin also attack    rely pool casual power use grow add define satisfy later  else save size modify   tail play


Another question arises : what's the order of words which lie on/near the same line ?

"You can **only manually create 23 words**. 24th is the checksum: 

* For 24 words the checksum is 8 bits, = 1/ 256, so there are 8 valid checksums for 2048 bip words. Can be bruteforced easily. Each 256-block from 1 to 2048 has 1 valid word-checksum. So, he could only **cherry pick 11 pairs**. The 12th has to be valid. But he may also chose the most intriguing and grammatically fitting checksum out of those 8 valid checksum words.

* Then, for 12 words, the 12th word (=checksum) is 4 bits  therefore 1/16 which yields to 128 valid checksum words, so every 16-block from 1 to 2048 contains a unique valid checksum word. Here, he could only **cherry pick 5 pairs**
 
* I can't even go for 18 words, but the idea is the same. 18 words = 6 bits checksum = 32 valid checksum words, and cherry picking 8 pairs

* 15 and 21 seed words (valid in bip) are not an option, since he mentioned ""pairs, it's either 12/18/24.  I know, 18 seems strange but some hot wallets like Coinomi use 18. But most hot wallets use 12 and **all** hardware wallets use 24. (keepkey, ledger, trezor etc.)

"Final theory since I've really run out of time.
Find pattern based on clues.
There are numbers 1-12 in the picture, means 12 pairs of words ""think in paris"". All appear in the white except 3, 5, 10, 12. White Bip words will correspond with white numbers, and orange with orange. 
If you draw lines through the words at the same angle of the words provided in the clues you get the following...
CODE EASILY ----> 1 (big number one) ATTACK EARLY -----> 2 (happens to go through no.2) ALMOST OPEN ----> 9 (line through 9...coincidence?)

Highlighted all white bip words in green and all orange bip words in blue. Drew lines through all words except 5, those didn't go through but came close. At lease ONE word from each pair must intersect a number to get the order. Pairs probably make semi-logical sense like the clues and likely form a message in total. 

In the image...white numbers with green words, orange numbers with blue words.

"EDIT: Made my 2 points into 3. 

tldr; Three things that I feel really sure of: The solution is a 24 word seed, the words were selected before the creation of the puzzle with an explicit order in mind, and the words make up a phrase of some significance, perhaps to the cryptocurrency as a whole. 


1. Someone posted a link to the Bitcoin stack exchange earlier with someone asking about creating a 24 word seed. This post was made at the end of this past January, and I'm pretty sure its the creator of this art for a few reasons. Also, if he used a 12-word seed it would be a matter of days to brute force the seed if you were able to collect the correct words (or even most of them). If you were doing a several thousand dollar giveaway, would you want it to be easy?


2. This goes back to the Bitcoinstackexchange post. If the creator was asking about how to make a specific mneumonic seed based on the English BIP39 words of his choosing, then he definitely selected the words beforehand. It is possible he did not, but extremely unlikely. Why go to the extra effort you randomized everything? 


3. This sort of overlaps with number 2, but remember, the puzzle's creator said we would be certain when we figured it out. It will be a phrase that makes sense. I don't think you'd even need to brute force the seed if we only had 12 words. Once you found the correct set of 12 words a sentence generator online could probably put it together. This is yet another reason why we probably have a 24 word seed. If the puzzle has a somewhat coherent statement about it and it holds 24 words, it'd be a lot harder to eyeball a meaningful statement out of them.

"I'm giving up. Spent way too much time already. I'm publishing what I have so far.

image https://imgur.com/8eQtur9

image without the Z-lines: https://imgur.com/a/FYDJO2u

excel https://pixeldra.in/u/ApVDii

Important assumptions I'm taking currently (that could be wrong):
-X (notdef symbol) is startpoint
-half of the picture is not relevant
-division into segments

CLUES:
""To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.""
=> look within = in circle
=> the NOTDEF symbol is home, hence starting point
=> home to inifinity symbol cuts circle in half. 
=> Beyond might mean you need to look a bit further, this crosses z=24

""You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture""
=> The above line (X->infinity) slices image almost diagonally, where my assumption is the lower half is the only relevant one since almost all hints are there

""Think in pairs""
=> Since there is z=0 to z=11 I think these are 12 solutions, and there are 12 paired solutions to combine to 24 words. However, not yet found the magic link.

""Code easily, attack early""
=> tilt your head so you see the usefull half. Code-easily goes LEFT-RIGHT, attack-early goes UP-DOWN
=> OR sequence orientations of words to find: down down straight up

""Lost transaction costs almost users""
=> how to divide in segments: lost is startpoint, transaction is in left segment (2), costs is new startpoint, almost users split left (0) and right (1) segment
=> alternatively, segment starts again from home

""00212121""
=> look at orientation of 0,1,2: they could be the segments. Possibly take words from each segment in this sequence? Why only 8 digits?
=> could also be the orientation of words, orientation as given by numbers 0,1,2

""Try +1""
=> ?

""Almost open""
=> open is the only word in the 'bad' segment. Maybe it's literally the checksum word? (it is aso next to the word SUM)

Failed attempts:
-listing words in order of radial distance from X (found only 21 words in lower half)
-starting from X, draw lines to each Z=0, Z=1 .., this often crosses exactly 1 BIP39 word every time but 0 for z=7 and multiple for 3 others
-drawing lines from number to number (0 - 1 - 2 -3..). This gives a very non-random drawing, often paired. There might be something to this, but it does not completely check out
-all words that are inside the B: I have 23 words but no order (ability come course entire fee gap help like main need one paper pool provide race rely speed split still system tail use way)
-many other failed tries :)

"> I found that the small words in the middle are a different color.

Which ones? I just did a check with an image editor and the color doesn't seem to change. In RGB white words are (255,255,255), orange words are (244,147,28) and the black background is (25,26,25).

I'm looking to see if there's anything weird with the edges, where's there's fading.

Edit: despite the circle and the bitcoin character being the same white as the white words (#ff ff ff) the fading around them is different. Around the circle, the drop from white to black is more uniform (e.g. (230, 229, 229), (180, 177, 176), (48, 46, 46)) whereas it looks brownier around words (e.g. (253,237,213), (207, 144, 71), (51, 42, 34)).

"Draw a line under CODE and through the big 1 until it comes out of the bottom of the left stalk of B, where the second T in TIMESTAMP intersects. Draw a line from that point to the middle of the X in the box. It crosses a bottom outer corner of the B, just under the C in ATTACKER. Continuing the angle of CODE from that point lines up with EASILY, then follow that line back up and out of the left of the middle of the B, where the N of CHAIN intersects. From that point, draw a horizontal line left until it goes under ATTACK, then draw a line from the start of it through 2, which in that plane underlines EARLY.

For ALMOST/OPEN, draw a line under ALMOST and follow it up until it intersects the border of the B, under the K of ATTACKER. Then draw a line from that point through the middle of the X in the box, which underlines OPEN.

I can kind of see how these work - in fact I noticed this pattern immediately and it was my first hunch - but the underlying rules currently elude me.

There is some sort of transformation of lines under the words, via the border of the B, and through a corresponding number. I think the ""challenge of the underlying security model"" in the original post could be a clue that these transformations are based around how elliptical curve point addition works.";3;0;False;zappso;dzbtu5y;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Until you consider the fact that the crypto market moves much faster than the stock market does. You may have heard it a lot, so you may think it’s a meme. But the crypto market is open 24/7/365, while the stock market is only open for 6.5 hours, 5 days a week (not including holidays). 


So doing the calculations, the crypto market is actually open about 5 times longer than the stock market. 


So the 1-year bear market in 2014 would be the equivalent of a 5-year bear market in stocks. The 2.5 year bull run from 2015 to 2017 was the equivalent of a 12.5 year bull run in stocks. The current bear market which has lasted for about 5 months, is the equivalent of 2 years in stocks.

The opposite of true. It's lazy thinking to say that one party is going to fix the problems, when both parties have been causing the problems for many decades.

ACA is a total and complete disaster, which is why we now have private, free market alternatives to health care popping up to fix the problem that government can't and won't solve.

No, sticking your head in the dirt is not pretend that government is actually solving problems and actually doing good in the world, and ignoring all the damage, destruction, and unintended consequences. 

I'm not going to throw my support into a domination system that has been failing people since its inception.

We can do much, much better as a society than these antiquated, top-down hierarchical structures that serve nobody but maybe a few in power.

">Nope, it makes much more sense than supporting the blue or red team. I do not believe the government should be making moral decisions for me, nor what I do with my body.

But right here, you would be going against your own interests then to vote for, or not vote against, the ""team"" that does want to make moral decisions about what you do with your body. You can obviously disagree on other aspects of their platform, but that is an example of how you do agree with a particular side. Further, a lot of voters are mobilized on this single issue alone, particularly among those that do want to make moral decisions about your body.

>If not for the government, we wouldn't need laws to protect neutrality! The government grants these corporations monopolies in the marketplace. They broke it, now you're telling me we need them to fix it? No, just get out of the way and let freedom work.

This is another confusing bit for me, because you acknowledge it's the corporations but lay the blame at government for trying to implement legislation to check the corporations. It's those private interests that are lobbying against Net Neutrality, and who try to capture regulatory agencies (as they have done with this administration's FCC) because the free market actively conspires to make itself less free. This also seems to mean that you again would be more naturally aligned with a particular ""team"" over the other.

>The opposite of true. It's lazy thinking to say that one party is going to fix the problems, when both parties have been causing the problems for many decades.

I agree, it's foolish to think either side can fix everything, or that either have been or could be perfect representatives. But you're letting perfection be the enemy of good. First and foremost, voter apathy (which is often due to the assertion that both sides are the same, which is why I'm engaging you on this) is the biggest culprit. It means that there are huge swaths of the population that representatives don't have to represent. If more people voted for the least worst option, eventually you start moving upwards until the acceptable options get increasingly better. Instead, the Overton Window has moved sharply to the extreme right, and Eisenhower would be called a spineless socialist today. Instead of continual progress, it's a race to the extreme, and to the bottom.

>ACA is a total and complete disaster, which is why we now have private, free market alternatives to health care popping up to fix the problem that government can't and won't solve.

ACA has major issues, but I don't know by what metric it would be a complete disaster. It also doesn't make sense to me to say there are private alternatives, because without a public option, the ACA is all about private insurance being accessible through an open marketplace. To say that government can't solve healthcare doesn't ring true to me when every other developed nation on Earth has UHC that does it better and cheaper; the US pays twice per capita the OECD average, and we have lower lifespans and higher infant mortality for it. It's like the new American Exceptionalism is being unable to do what others have done successfully for decades.

>No, sticking your head in the dirt is not pretend that government is actually solving problems and actually doing good in the world, and ignoring all the damage, destruction, and unintended consequences.

Then vote, especially in primaries where you have more power to select a candidate who does more closely align with your views. Without being engaged civically, it's just empty complaining about how ineffectual the government is, while giving yourself a way out of having to learn more about the issues or candidates. And that is lazy. The government is nothing more than people, and will only function as well as the people it's composed of are. It's failed in many ways, and yet also built national infrastructure, put a man on the moon, and created the internet. It also regularly does a [massive amount of other tasks that completely and positively affect our daily lives](https://i.imgur.com/Aic2o.png) that go unnoticed because that's not worthy of headlines.

>I'm not going to throw my support into a domination system that has been failing people since its inception. We can do much, much better as a society than these antiquated, top-down hierarchical structures that serve nobody but maybe a few in power.

The US has and its system has had many failures, but also many triumphs. Unfortunately, top-down hierarchical structures will have to exist in any enterprise, public or private. The only alternatives are anarchy, from which hierarchies based on power and resources will still emerge like the warlords of Somalia, or a fully post-state society like Marxist communism, which is unlikely until humans are completely post-scarcity. So, if we have to deal with these hierarchies barring major and likely disastrous change, it makes sense to me to continually work towards a better version of it.

>Decentralization and bitcoin are a nice start. Hierarchies are going to die anyway, might as well stop clinging to these old structures and systems and get on board with a decentralized world now.

I'm a big believer in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. But I think looking at fiat is a good example of why I think that, barring complete catastrophe, current power structures are here to stay. Fiat's value is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which is the best guarantee of value you can have. The reason is because for that to no longer mean something, the nation would have to have completely unraveled, and any way in which that could happen would mean complete global disaster.";1;1;False;jvalordv;dzcemeu;Is this a bull run?;8kzzay;https://imgur.com/EEkCke2

This is a temporary sale. Grab what you can while they are under $50,000. 

As for Gov control over BTC? No, this is whales with the market by the balls letting the Gov think it has control. BTC is filled with the best and brightest in the industry. You really think a room full of grey hairs can control this movement?

"> to fight inflation

Why are you anti-inflation out of interest? If you don't have inflation, then there's zero incentive to put money into assets - why spend any of your bitcoins if you know they'll be worth more tomorrow? The economy would ground to a halt without inflation. ";1;1;False;;dzbyxdf;Banks on fire, by Alex Schaefer;8kf5y3;https://i.redd.it/drnal7l2lny01.jpg
"a) you need stuff: cloth, food,place to live etc. it all costs money.
but yeah, if you'll put them away without inflation you don't have to worry about it loosing it's buying ability over time like currency with arbitrary inflation does  

b) ""tomorrow"" doesn't literally mean tomorrow. you just spend some and earn some by working.

c) ""anti-inflation"" doesn't mean money will be worth more tomorrow, it means they wont cost less

d)  >economy would ground to a halt 

with near zero inflation and near zero deflation it wouldn't, not because of low inflation anyway

e) at this point cryptocurrency doesn't work as intended due to relatively low outspread and resulting high volatility";1;0;False;NeuroCellElectroFlow;dzc7fso;Banks on fire, by Alex Schaefer;8kf5y3;https://i.redd.it/drnal7l2lny01.jpg
