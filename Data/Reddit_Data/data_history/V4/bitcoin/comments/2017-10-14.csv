"If you’re still looking at it as a get rich quick scheme, then you’re completely wrong. Look at it as another type of asset, like stocks, currency, or index funds. If you think you’ll get a better return with bitcoin than with any of those, then it’s worth it for you. 

In your (made up) example you’re still getting 33% return. Don’t know in what world that’s not considered useful. People would kill to get in on an investment vehicle that consistently returned 33%. 

Seriously, I think your understanding of historical investment returns is way off. Anything above 5-8%, which is what the market indices give on good years, is good.

"Depends on your definition of ""naturally"".

The coins are mined - that is, people who have invested a lot in computing power and electricity are doing work that produces new coins.  They don't get to choose how many coins or when they get them, that is up to the algorithm that everyone mutually agrees on (if they tried to change this, it just wouldn't be bitcoin anymore and their fake coins would be rejected by the network).

Bitcoins are indeed limited to 21 million BTC.  More precisely, it's actually 21 million billion satoshi, since that's the only 'real' unit understood by the system.  1 Bitcoin - as one hundred million satoshi - is just a convenient amount that once upon a time made sense for dealing with practical sized numbers but is starting to do so less and less each day (personally, I have all of my clients and apps set to mBTC but may consider switching to µBTC once the value roughly doubles from what it is now).";1;0;False;dalebewan;docu9bj;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"I wanted to chime in and say that it's like stock trading. Kings have been made beggars, beggars have been made kings. Everyone wants to be a successful trader. Not everyone gets to be.

Look, we might see the price drop back below $5000, and that might discourage people buying right now... but its the natural volatility of this generally new type of asset. And I think that those $200 you have might be enough for a nice return. You just have to be patient, and be wise.

Two, because I am confident in my perspective and I trust myself to recognize when its wise to sell and when its wise to buy.

"Your feeling is very possibly false. If your computer is compromised with a key logger, you could lose your Bitcoin. Someone posted a thread here who had that happen just the other day, and there are other attacks as well, this is just one example. Also, if there is any way to connect your online presence eventually back to you, attackers could specifically target you. This would be more likely for either known whales or people who sometimes come on here and note how much they have, but worth keeping in mind.

Even if you're very safe, you'd want to weigh the risk to the cost. If you have only small Bitcoin to try it out, it isn't a big risk. But imagine if you either purchase more or the holdings you have accrue enough value that you're sitting on thousands, tens of thousands or more in value.

"What I mean by trading is buying and selling, such that you sell at a high price to buy back at a lower price. Increasing ether the amount of USD that you have, or the BTC that you have. When it comes to a trading strategy, there's no such thing as ""too simple"", there's only ""it works"" and ""it doesnt work"".

Now, what you're proposing is what I like to call a ""holders' strategy"". Which, historically speaking... **it works**. I'm doing some quick math here, but if you had started the first week of 2014, you'd currently be holding 6.04 bitcoin, possibly more (I did 1200/900+1200/400+1200/800+1050/5000, that gives me a conservative estimate of how many bitcoin you would have purchased by now). That would be a $32,030 payday for a $4650 investment over three years and ten months. But keep in mind that you would have been in the red for most of that, you would have broken even sometime 2016. Holding works, but people tend not to like the waiting. And its not the most efficient strategy. **In summary**, I believe it is the safest strategy, but it's long-term in nature (you can spend up to two years in the red) and it's efficiency is medium. If you're OK just letting your bitcoin essentially sit there for years on end, I would recommend just buying at whatever price it is, every 2 weeks. *An essential part of any strategy is consistency*.

What I do... I like to call it ""brute force"" trading. I use margin trading, and I trade a swap... which complicates the explanation a bit... but long story short, I have a set amount that I buy or sell every 2%-3% (it was every $100 when it was below $5000, now it's every $200). So, for example, I sold $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5800, and I bought $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5600, and the sell order for $30 at $5800 is back up. If the price gets below $4500, my buy orders will be bigger than my sell orders, if the price is over $6000, my sell orders will be bigger than my buy orders. Fairly simple, not much though or consideration needed, that's why I call it a ""brute force"" approach to trading.

If you want to get started in trading, you probably can right now. Bitfinex is a pretty good exchange for a quick sign-up for trading bitcoin.

"1. It was a radical innovation in the sense of how all of those pieces were put together to form the first scarce decentralized immutable digital commodity.  

2. All value is subjective. Bitcoin serves a purpose as digitil money which is scarce and not issued by a government. People value that. The fact that there is risk of losing it or it being hacked is completely irrelevant. It's like arguing that gold, which has remained valuable for millennia, isn't valuable because it can be lost or stolen.    
The vast amounts of energy are needed to ensure the security and discovery of bitcoins. Without that energy usage (ie. work) bitcoins wouldn't be secure, counterfeit-proof or scarce.  

3. Put your tin foil hat away. You're postulating some grand conspiracy where all the exchanges across the globe, not to mention peer to peer markets like LocalBitcoin, are colluding to hide true price discovery. Any price mismatch with the real market price would be arbitraged away by traders.   
In addition, all fiat currencies can be and are priced in other currencies. That's what the whole FOREX market is; speculation! Sure BTC is more volatile but that's only because its size is minute compared to government currencies. Volatility has and will continue to decrease over time as BTC grows.  

4. Bitcoin is NOT an Ponzi by definition. Ponzi's promise guaranteed returns, are opaque, and are tightly controlled by a conman. When a Ponzi bubble bursts the Ponzi ends with a value of 0 never to recover. Bitcoin has had multiple bubbles, bursts and recoveries in its history yet has gained in value.

No, until you trade that money for a sandwich, and eat the sandwich, you have still lost wealth.

The actual truth is that you have gained real hard money when you buy bitcoin, and you have probably traded away soft inflationary currency assuming you bought with fiat. Even if the price of btc goes down, you are still up hard real money.

"Thank you for answering.  

You have clarified that it's as secure as the network I use and the devices I use. In my specific case do not think my stuff is super secure, what with networked printers and such.  What if I try to print my QR code and it turns out to go to the wrong printer on some other floor at my job?  Can whoever gets that printout take my tendiez?     

I'm not super confident in the security of my devices, and would be crestfallen if my wealth was tied to a specific device or a specific QR code that I perhaps had a stroke and couldn't access.  Holy smokes what a bad roll of the dice something like that could be.

If money worked how Bitcoin is working, older users would be infinitely more wealthy than younger folks. 
Bitcoin’s price is overinflated man. It’s just bits on a computer. There’s no difference between other bits on a computer. 
Trading currencies is actually very easy... go to a goddamn bank or exchange... the paperwork is dependent on the dealer. 

You’ll never have a problem with government if you keep cash... 

People on the darkweb markets don’t really use BTC anymore because it’s not that private. Monero dominates those markets.

FYI, I rode part of this bubble because I didn’t think it would collapse, yet... but a number of regulators are taking notice. I did it all on leverage with no margin and then sold.

I know you read someone say Blockchain good, bitcoin bad so you repeat it but the only reason they KNOW Blockchain is good is because Bitcoin proved and proves it again and again everyday.  Hackers would love to hack and steal bitcoin from the network.  They can't.  

As far the price which matters little to me when fighting evil and doing good.  But looking at bitcoin and saying $5700 is the price is ignorant. We're gonna split 1000x and goto $5.70 soon anyways.  Many business use mBTC as their main unit that deal with bitcoin.   

But that doesn't matter $5700 or $5.70.  **All bitcoin is worth $90 billion.**    Bitcoin is a worldwide accepted currency that's gaining users daily and can't be touched by governments.  That means less paperwork, less time for acceptance, and less arbitrary freezes.  It means you can buy and take possession of a $50,000 car at 8pm on a Saturday from an out of town stranger.  

The entire point is you dnt have to trust any one. $90Billion is not a lot in the world for a system that cannot be corrupted like governments and government currency. $90B is not a lot in the world of finance.  

Bitcoin trades just a few billion a day.  JP Morgan Chase CEO just said they move $6 trillion a day.  Over 1000x more and that one bank in one country.  Bitcoin is worldwide.  Americans are only 25% of the world economy and going less daily.  

(Another reason Bitcoin is so amazing is the massive restrictions the Americans place on their currency. Iran, Russia, Cuba & North Korea are not allowed to use it. You think they don't want a replacement?)

China might ban bitcoin exchanges but person to person trades are made daily.  Can never stop those ever.  Besides Japan, Korea & Singapore gladly accept.  Russia might out restrictions but Ukraine won't.  Etc, etc. 

As long as some countries accept and you can change for fiat somewhere this currency will continue to grow.

My belief for Bitcoin was that it was the first established crypto, and had utility for those on the dark web, groups that always work in cash. This gave the coins liquidity that would always be available to other market participants, because they had no other option to trade with. Monero is now their currency of choice, so what is the point of Bitcoin besides speculation? 

Bitcoin is not worldwide accepted. Russia is banning it. China banned domestic access. Japan and South Korea do not actually accept it as legal tender.... they labeled it as an asset class. Japan and Russia are both launching their own cryptos. 

JP Morgan is international. 

The US doesn’t put huge restrictions on currency. All governments want to know where their currency is going and who has it. Russia has US dollar currency reserves so you’re wrong.... 

You can’t have thought about the parallels between bitcoin and pyramid schemes? No one want to be at the bottom of that pyramid. Remember internet mall? 

Your comparison to the 90s is unfounded. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009..... that’s a fair comparison.

"**Money should used as a tool for exchange. Governments use money as a tool for control.** You play by the rules, you're allowed to you use their money. You don't and you're done.  

In addition many mistakes are often made.  You accept cash and decide you deposit $9000 in the bank four times because you're not doing anything wrong but why fill out extra paperwork by going over 10k unless you have to?  

Then you find your life savings frozen for structuring. Maybe you get your money back in 18months.  Probably get a lot less back after lawyers fees.  

What about when the government freezes the wrong people's accounts?  Either by thinking you're guilty when you're not or because you have the same name as someone 

I formed a company.  The name was similar to a Mexican drug lords name.  I never heard of the OFAC but every time I form a company I now have to check it against the OFAC database to make sure I don't match up.   

I couldn't do a wire or any transfers without taking an hour with my bank. This just isn't a practical way to do business.

Now with FACTA if you're an American living overseas you pretty much are locked out of banking.  In the country I live in, you cannot open a bank account until your a resident.  Well, you can't be a resident until you've been here a year and show 60k in bank account.  

And once you can you have tons of paperwork to deal with.  Very first thing every country will ask you when you open a bank account is if you hold an American passport.  Sometimes they'll open the account with severe restrictions and severe paperwork requirements. Sometimes not at all.  

-------

Let's say you live in Brazil and want to pay someone in Turkey.  You have to exchange Reals for Dollars.  Then Dollars for Lira.  You think that's cheap?  You think that's a simple no paperwork process?  

Or you can click SEND and send them bitcoins.  The way money should be.

Bitcoin are also good for bad things.  Buying weed, or medicine without a prescription. You think Mexican drug lords or sellers on the dark web create more violence?  You think ordering weed online delivered to your house is safer or more dangerous than going to the street corner and buying from a random guy with no reviews and no history of selling a good product.  

Let's say you take a bribe for the world cup.  You've never visted the USA in your life but you take dollars for the bribe. Now the Americas arrest you for something they have nothing to do with but.... but..... you used their currency and thus must follow their rules. 

---------

Governments also cheat with their currency. They all print more than they should.  Americans get away with it only because their the world reserve but they won't be forever.  Other countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe or Cyprus or Greece.  You think they want to use their currencies?  Even the last two have the Euro but what does it matter if you can't get your money from the banks?

----------

The dollar is being inflated away.  Seniors that saved their whole lives have dollars that earn 1% and are worth much less than they were when they worked for them due to the inflation tax so governments can reward their corrupt rich friends.

"I don't know if this CEO just has no idea what they are talking about? Or are they trying to troll or influence the market?

>""And a central bank — of course they can misuse it. The central bank [can also] inflate it. So there is a use case for bitcoin. If you live in Venezuela, North Korea, if you're a criminal, great product. I mean that. It's better than cash or deposits in that country. Cuba.

Two paragraphs and this guy gives us 101 reasons why the government and central banks are full of shit. Literally provides examples of what inhumane measures they will go to control peoples lives.

"I really want one of these. 

Also, why not set your rotational axis as ($market_percentage * 2), with 0 = horizontal? Then have a button that selects against 1 hr, 12 hours, 24 hours, and an inverse log (or log, I may be thinking about it wrong) after 45 degrees? So, market up 60%, but the angle would only be about 48 degrees, etc. 

Though, representing this in an Arduino may run the controller out of RAM storing and calculating values, unless there's a more efficient way of representing it, or off-loading the calculations from the actual controller?
