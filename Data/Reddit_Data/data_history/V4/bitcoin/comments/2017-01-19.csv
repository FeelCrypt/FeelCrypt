"There wasn't anything I could do.

I attended 10 trials over similar things.  And it pisses me off so badly that they act like they had nothing they could charge her with.   A little over 1000 military and civilian contractors go to jail every year over similar offenses ";1;1;False;truckerslife;dclt2fk;"""R.I.P. Bitcoin.

He got 2 years for mishandling classified material during a time of war.  It falls under acts of treason.  He was a good guy but he did email secured information to an unsecured server. ;1;1;False;truckerslife;dclrymt;"""R.I.P. Bitcoin.

"I do think they should have charged her because she was mishandling high level classified material.

Trevor and others are mishandling information that barely has a classification standard.";1;0;False;truckerslife;dcmhfcg;"""R.I.P. Bitcoin. It's Time to Move On""....funny billboard driving around in Miami";5okj65;https://i.redd.it/mepjyw6g1cay.jpg

"Very funny. Although, strictly speaking, the fake news is also on the right hand side  of the billboard: The statement ""Bitcoin hits a new all-time-high"" is provably false:

Bitfinex:

* Nov 2013: 1175 USD/BTC

* Jan 2017: 1166 USD/BTC

Bitstamp:

* Nov 2013: 1163 USD/BTC

* Jan 2017: 1140 USD/BTC

So however I twist and turn it - I cannot see a new all-time-high in 2017 yet.";1;0;False;Amichateur;dclu0d2;"""R.I.P. Bitcoin. It's Time to Move On""....funny billboard driving around in Miami";5okj65;https://i.redd.it/mepjyw6g1cay.jpg
