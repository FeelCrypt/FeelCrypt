"**So hashes and timestamps are used to make it very hard to inject fake blocks in to this chain and the guessing of the lucky number has to do with these hashes?**

Yes, the lucky number that the miners are trying to guess depends on what is in the previous block. This way they can't cheat by guessing for the lucky numbers before the other miners. Every time the lucky number is guessed a miner creates a new block full of transaction that then all the other miners can verify as valid, the miners then take the data from this block as the start of a new race for every miner to find the next lucky number. 

**So miners are in a race to try to find a random number to satisfy a calculation and when they find this they then let all the other miners know and those miners can quickly verify the calculation?**

Correct, but you can't take the calculation itself and try to extract the number out of it because this is again a form of a one way function. You have to try until you get lucky or until ll you have tried everything. But when you find it's very easy to see that it's correct. 

**And trying everything takes a long time?**

Yes and this is where difficulty becomes a factor! 

**Yes you said difficulty determined how hard or easy it will be to guess correctly because a higher difficulty means they have to make more guesses to find the lucky number and less guesses when the diffuculty is lower.**


Remember how I talked about the reward that bitcoin miners get because they get to include the first transaction in a block by giving coins to themselves?

**Yes, this is why miners mine bitcoin because they want to shout to everybody in the network the first valid block because if there block is the first valid block then in that block is a transaction to one of their addresses and so now they have more coins!**

Yes but we need to regulate this process.

**Why?**

Because this way we can regulate how fast new coins are being created. We want new coins to be created every 10 minutes and every 4 years we want the amount of coins you get for solving a block to go down. 

**Why?**

Because Bitcoin was designed in such a way that there can never be more than 21 million Bitcoins.

**Oh but that means that there can not be more then 21 million Bitcoin users because they would all have one bitcoin**

No, because one Bitcoin we can divide a single Bitcoin in to a 100 000 000 little cents.  We call one of these cents a satoshi or sat for short.

**So why does have Bitcoin a limit of 21 million?**

Because this will artificially give Bitcoin the properties of being scarce, that means that if 21 million people all want to have a full Bitcoin that will probably never happen. And so people might be willing to pay a lot of money for a bitcoin, because they are so scarce. 

**Kind of like gold?**

Yes but don't compare bitcoin one on one with gold, that does not work. We will come back to that later.

So Satoshi thought that creating a limit to the amount of bitcoins that can exist in the network would give Bitcoin a property that we call ""deflationary"". It's a very stupid term because it should have been called inflationary, but smart people always like to make things complicated. What it means is this: 

When in our current financial system everything you can buy become more expensive we call this inflation. You could also say that our money is becoming less valuable because you can now buy less with the same amount of money then before.

The opposite of this is deflation, where products in the stores become cheaper. You could say that your money is becoming more valuable because you can now buy more with it then before. 

Our current financial systems have mechanism that allow it for somewhat control inflation and deflation.

Satoshi though that it would be good if Bitcoin would be deflationary in nature. 

**Okay so that means that bitcoins will become more valuable towards the future is that because of the 21 million limit?** 

No, the 21 million limit only gives it the property of scarcity but a fixed limit makes it very hard for somebody to control the amount of inflation and deflation.  

**So how did Satoshi make Bitcoin deflationary?**

He did so buy a mechanism that will bring less and less Bitcoin in circulation as time goes by.

Remember when I told you that when a miner finds the lucky number and makes a block that he get's some Bitcoin as a reward?

**Yes**

Well when Bitcoin started the first 4 years this number was 50 Bitcoin. The second four years this number was 25 Bitcoins. Every 4 years this number goes in half. If we plot that over time, it means that only 21 million bitcoin will ever be mined and that the last Bitcoin will be mined somewhere in 2140. 

**And that is a mechanism for deflation?**

Yes because every 4 years the supply of newly mined Bitcoin will be cut in half. When the supply goes down and the demand stays the same the price goes up. This is why Bitcoin is deflationary by design. 

Now remember when I said that the time between two blocks is roughly 10 minutes?

"So this big book with a bunch of account numbers on them is in bitcoin called the blockchain. Bitcoin mining is the group process of working on this blockchain. 

**Why do we need to work on the blockchain?**

Because people like to make bitcoin transactions and then this big book with all the account numbers and balance in them needs to be updated. We are now going to refer to this big book with all the account numbers and balances as the blockchain. 

**Okay tell me more about the blockchain, is it a chain of blocks?**

Correct! Satoshi writes

>We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the
next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.

**But I want to know what bitcoin mining is, you said that miners together work on the blockchain?**

Yes, when people want to make a bitcoin transaction they shout to the internet:

Hey Bitcoin network: I am address number 5 and  I would like to send 4 coins from my address  number 5 to  address number 6. Everybody on the network then repeats this shout. 

**Yeah but anybody can say anything on the internet, how do we know if you are truly the owner of address number 5 and how do we know if you actually have 4 coins?** 

Because when you shout at the bitcoin network you need to sign that shout with a secret key, one that only you have!

**But if I shout the secret key then everybody will have the secret key!**

That's why you don't shout the secret key, you take the public key and do some mathematical magic with your private key and then the result of that you shout to the bitcoin network. 

**Okay so with bitcoin there is a private key and a public key. I guess that the public key is public and the private key needs to stay a secret? So you never actually shout the private key, you use the private key to do some mathematical magic and then shout the result to the network?**

Yes, lets go back to our example: 

>Hey Bitcoin network: I am address number 5 and  I would like to send 4 coins from my address  number 5 to  address number 6. 

What do Bitcoin miners do when they receive this transaction? First they need to know if you are the owner of address number 5. They can easily do this because you have done a mathematical operation that nobody can do expect the one that own the secret key that is linked to that address number 5. So they know that you are truly the owner of address number 5. Now they need to know if you really have 4 coins to give to address number 5. Since the  blockchain is this chain of blocks and since blocks are just a bunch of transactions this is easy. They traceback in to the blockchain and they go over all the coins that number 4 has ever received and all the transactions that number 4 has ever send. If the difference between in and out is bigger then 4 that means that address number 5 has the coins. 

**So miners can check if a transaction is valid by going through the blockchain to figure out if the  coins are there and they can figure out if you are truly the owner of those coins by looking at a mathematical function that only the owner of number 5 can do  proofing he has the secret key, also called the private key?**

Correct! So now that the transaction is valid, it needs to be written down in the blockchain! But what miner is going to be the one that writes this down in the blockchain? All of them? 

**Yes, I would like to know this! Bye the way you are explaining this greatly!**

See now we are getting to the essence of bitcoin mining. When you shout your transaction to the bitcoin network you are not the only one. Other people are shouting transactions too. This is the start of a race! 

**A race between  bitcoin miners?**

Yes, they want to take all these transactions and put them in a  block, and then take the chain of blocks and build that new block on top of that chain!

**So it's a race to build block on top of the blockchain?**

Correct! See not every block that the miners are building will make it to the chain. There can only be one! 

**How does  that work, by the way why are these bitcoin miners doing this. Are they just nice people?**

They might be nice people, but they are doing this because if they can win this block building race with the other miners they get some free coins for it! 

**Free coins! I want some free coins too! But how does this work?**



Well then you need to become a bitcoin miner. These free (they still cost electricity though, later more) coins work like this: All these miners are building their  blocks. They take all the transaction that are valid and they build this block, but in the first line of this block they write a special kind of transaction. They write transaction that does not have a previous input! 

**You mean like coins that did not previously exist in this great book full of accounts and transactions between these accounts?**

Yes, this is the magical process of how bitcoins are created. The first transaction of every block is a miner giving coins to himself!

"When computer networks became a thing there was one big unsolved problem. How do you make the operators of those computers work together in a network without having to trust them and without somebody being able to cheat? 

So two types of networks became possible

1) Centralized networks where access  is not open and you need to trust each participant but they can't cheat cause you know who they are and they would loose access if they try to cheat. You need a central place to keep track of this, that's why they are centralized. 

2) Decentralized networks where access is open and where you don't know your participants but where it's possible for those participants to cheat. For example people that download over bittorrent but never upload. If everybody would do this, bittorrent would not work. Decentralized networks make it possible to cooperate without having to trust anybody but it's hard to protect from people abusing the network. 

The current financial networks of banks working together is a network of type 1. The current internet is a type 1 network. Big service providers connect their networks with other big service providers but if they would start cheating, you know who they are and you can disconnect them. You have many type 2 networks on the internet but they are build upon the physical infrastructure of the internet, which is a type 1 network. 

A type 2 financial network was never possible because what if people are not honest and start cheating, when it comes to the flow of data on the internet  or people that download over bittorent but never upload this is one thing but what about money?  Money is serious business! 

Satoshi Nakamoto was the first person (or group) that came up with a practical solution to this problem. This is what he wrote in his [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for
most   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid   mediating   disputes.  



>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third  party.    Transactions  that  are  computationally  impractical  to   reverse   would  protect  sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The
system   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.


Satoshi then describes a genius mechanism where cheating in this network is only possible when you have more then half the processing power of that network but where it will always be more interesting for you to join that network with your power instead of attacking it. Think about it, if you invest a 100 million dollars to make enough special hardware so you control 51% of the bitcoin network and then you use that hardware to destroy the networkyou have just invested a billion dollars in to hardware you have just made obsolete yourself. Well done, your investors won't be happy. You have just played yourself. 

Here is what Satoshi writes: 

>By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the   block   containing   the   transaction.     Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.
The   incentive   may   help   encourage   nodes   to   stay   honest.     If   a   greedy   attacker   is   able   to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

**So what is this mechanism that Satoshi invented?** 

Satoshi writes: 

>We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.  We started with
the   usual   framework   of   coins   made   from   digital   signatures,   which   provides   strong   control   of
ownership,   but   is   incomplete   without   a   way   to   prevent   double-spending.     To   solve   this,   we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that   quickly   becomes   computationally   impractical   for   an   attacker   to   change   if   honest   nodes
control a majority of CPU power.   The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.   Nodes
work all at once with little coordination.   They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can
leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   proof-of-work   chain   as   proof   of   what
happened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism


**So what is proof of work?** 

Satoshi writes: 


>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.   Once the CPU
effort   has   been   expended   to   make   it   satisfy   the   proof-of-work,   the   block   cannot   be   changed
without  redoing  the   work.    As   later   blocks   are  chained   after  it,   the  work  to  change  the  block
would include redoing all the blocks after it.
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able   to   allocate   many   IPs.     Proof-of-work   is   essentially   one-CPU-one-vote.     The   majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains.   To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes.  

**So what does that all mean, explain it to me like I am five!** 

Bitcoin is a big book full of bank accounts that only have a number but not a name. Under every bank account entry it simply lists how many coins have gone in and out of this bank account  number and to which  bank account number these coins have. To find out the balance of a number we just calculate all the coins in and out of a  bank account number and what is left is the balance on this bank account number. 

**Ah I get it now, but what if somebody tries to change the big book and cheat and give himself more coins?**

We make sure that everybody has a copy of  this book, that way if somebody tries to cheat we compare his book with all the other books, if one is different then we say: get out you cheater! 


**Okay so everybody has a copy of this book but then how do you keep everything in sync?**

We make sure that the book is one long chain where everything that we ad to the book we ad by linking it to what is already in the book. Every time somebody does a transaction we tell that to everybody and everybody repeats it to everybody. 

**Ah I see, you just build together with a whole bunch of people on that what is already established**

Correct! 

**But that will lead to chaos! What if some people build on this and some people build on that, you might not end up with 10 000 different versions of the book but maybe you end up with 10 different versions of the book?**


This is where mathematics start playing a role. Within mathematics it's possible to have a function that is easy in one direction but hard in the other direction. I don't have time to explain all of that, it's basically the essence of cryptography where you have a public and a private key. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko62sibi668) uses the mixing of colors as an example of explaining modular arithmetic (clock arithmetic)

"**Oh so this means the miners can cheat**

No, because miners can make as many blocks as they want and they can put in those  blocks whatever they want but remember, only one block makes it in to the chain! 

**Okay so the miners are in a race ... to make not just any blocks, but the first ... valid block that will become the next block in the chain?**

Yes correct, see when the miners are putting all these transactions that they heard people shout in to a block they have to also guess the correct number. The first one to guess the correct number can then take all these transactions and start with his own transaction where he magically creates these coins for himself. The miner then shouts the lucky number to all the other miners. 

**So the miners are constantly listening for transactions, trying to make blocks out of transactions but a valid block is a block that included the correct number? What do you mean by guessing the correct number?**

Guessing the correct number is the essence of bitcoin mining. Again it works because of this mathematical function that is hard in one way and easy in the other way. Remember that private key and public key thing? Anybody can easily verify this even with a potato computer but if you want to cheat you have but one option: Guess a trillion billion times untill you get lucky. After every guess you need to verify and see if you guessed correctly.  Bitcoin mining does this but with a twist. 

**Tell me about the twist! This is so damn interesting**

Yeah welcome to the club pall,  see if I make you guess between 1 and 10 it won't take long before you say the number that I had in mind. If I make you guess between 1 and a million this is a different story. Bitcoin controls how large the range of numbers is. If a miner needs to guess between 1 and 10 this is called a very low diffuculty. If a miner needs to guess between 1 and 1000 000 this is called a very high difficulty.  But we will come back to this later. For now you should take from this that the reason why Bitcoin mining is so resource intensive and why it uses so much electricity is that bitcoin mining is the collective guessing of an entire machine of networks all trying to get lucky. 


**Okay let's go back to transactions then. Bitcoin minining is taking transaction to build blocks with  but only the block build with the lucky number will be seen as valid by the other miners and make it in to the blockchain?""**



Yes, and so when the other miners hear you shout your block with the correct lucky number they can verify it very easily, they then say to themselves: Oh boy I better stop making my own block, my block did not win the race, I did not get lucky, this guy his block won the race. Let's take this guy his block and build upon that block. 

**Ah so all the miners are in a race to create the first valid block and whatever miner creates the first valid block is rewarded with coins and that block becomes the latest block in this block chain and then everything starts all over?**

Yes and this process can be verified by everybody because of how smart Satoshi was. Hey congratulations, we are not even half way there and already you have more knowledge of bitcoin then 90% of everybody that has ever bought bitcoin. 

**Tell me more!**

See these block form a chain because every block makes a reference to the block before it. These references work because of timestamps and hashes. This means that each block sets a precedence for what is the next valid block and at the same time strengthens the validity of every block under it. This is why committing fraud in the blockchain is very very hard but more about that later. 

**What is a timestamp?**

Satoshi writes:

>A timestamp server works by taking a
hash   of   a   block   of   items   to   be   timestamped   and   widely   publishing   the   hash,   such   as   in   a
newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].   The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
time, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in
its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

**Then what is a hash?**

Rember when we where talking about mathematical functions that are hard in one direction but easy in the other? This makes it possible to have system where verifying is very easy, it might take 500 nano seconds for a computer to verify. But it makes it hard to cheat, it might take 500 years for a computer to calculate in the other direction because it can only make a guess, check it if it's not correct make another guess and check that... until it accidentally guesses correctly which can take very long when the range of numbers is big enough.  

**So a hash is like that?**

Yes a hash is a one way function of a bunch of data.  Let's take some made up data like this 

wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72

The hash of this might be 4390AC

Do you see something peculiar? The hash is much shorter then the data. Now with a hash function it's  going to be very easy for a computer to take wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72 and calculate  4390AC but IMPOSSIBLE to take 4390AC and turn tthat in to wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72

Yes impossible because 4390AC might also be a valid hash for

**Are you trying to say that for a set of data there can only be one hash but for a hash there can be multiple sets of data that lead to that hash?**

Of course, otherwise we could infinitely compress data because a hash can be calculated from a data set of ANY LENGHT while the hash will always be of the same length even if the data is just a single 0 or 1. 

If I can turn 4390AC in to ONLY wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72 I can also turn 4390AC  in to all possible data in the universe, which is logically impossible unless we live in a simulator and The Great Programmer accidentally disables the logic service. 

**Okay you are starting to loose me, can we come back to this later?**

I will do my best. 


**Okay so what is Satoshi speaking about when he talk about timestamp and hashes?**

Let's go back to our block of chains. In order to prevent cheating these blocks contain references to each other in the form of hashes of timestamps. Why? Because then a  block can prove that it was build upon a previous block because these blocks include a timestamp and a hash of the timestamp of the previous block. See if then you want to create false block you need to solve a one way function in the other direction and that is very hard because the only way to do it is to guess and hope you get lucky or improve your odds by guessing faster or make more guesses as the same time. 

**Okay so these blocks link to each other in such a way that injecting something fake in to this link is very hard to do with a computer?**

Correct! You should be explaining this to me, at least you keep it short and simple! 

**So what about his puzzle that  the miners are trying to solve in order to build the first valid new block and get the coin reward?**

Satoshi writes: 

>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.   Once the CPU
effort   has   been   expended   to   make   it   satisfy   the   proof-of-work,   the   block   cannot   be   changed
without  redoing  the   work.    As   later   blocks   are  chained   after  it,   the  work  to  change  the  block
would include redoing all the blocks after it.

So here is how that works. When miners want to create the first valid new block they first take a bit of data from the previous block, the block they want to build upon. They then try to find a hash of that data that starts with a number of zeros. This is that guessing and the lucky number that we talked about before. It is now time to introduce a new term: the nonce. 

Remember the guessing the miners do and the lucky number? 

**Yes from like 30 paragraphs before ... now wait a minute who decided on what the lucky number is that the miners try to guess? How can they guess a correct number that everybody is trying to find and nobody knows?**

This is where hashes and the nonce come together and create the working mechanism. 

**I am feeling a slight headache, is that the price of enlightenment?**

Don't interrupt me so much. 

**Sorry, continue please I want to understand**
