"**Correlation does not imply causation**

In statistics, many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated, it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other. That ""correlation proves causation,"" is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ""with this, therefore because of this,"" and ""false cause."" A similar fallacy, that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is the post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this."") fallacy.

For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD. Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens.

"> As soon as something like the lightning network is up and working, which chain will be more attractive? Blockchain A which kept itself relatively small by not clogging itself up with coffee and chewing gum transactions or Blockchain B which is a multitude in size.

Arguably the 'bloated' chain will already be the chain in more widespread use, otherwise it probably wouldn't be so bloated, right? So why would users care about which blockchain is larger when their choice is between LN on blockchain A that was digital gold up until then and not accepted anywhere and LN on blockchain B that is already in widespread use? For users, blockchain size is just a technical detail, for node administrators it's just a different set of requirements. I agree that the blockchain should be kept compact, but I vehemently disagree that this should come at the cost of adoption like the game Core is playing now.

> Bitcoin isn't gold. It has no use

This is literally what every buttcoiner said 7 years ago.

You guys all miss the most important aspect. Decentralized, global, permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant value transfer.

This power isn't used best for buying a cup of coffee. This power is used best to topple authoritarian regimes and collapse central banks and their fiat currencies.

Buying coffee is not revolutionary, and you don't need a powerful decentralized network for it.  But eluding capital controls, escaping financial tyranny, and being able to freely transfer your wealth without permission is revolutionary.

Bitcoin protects the revolutionary parts of system. Bitcoin Cash protects the act of buying a cup of coffee. ";36;9;False;gizram84;dpwkqx1;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

Long TX may slightly affect liquidity by slowing it down. With BCH there is no liquidity to slow down in the first place.

BCH isn't even remotely close to BTC in terms of total tx. 

And your premise that markets care ""just as much"" about usability isn't supported by any objective facts.

For Sure, there has to be a MINIMUM of usability in the underlying coin. But BTC clearly meets that standard. And once that standard is met, the market doesn't care too much about small incremental improvements between coins.

"> Look, whoever wanted to buy BCH, did so at this point.

I think you are off on this point, not all people rushed into buying as soon as they could. Bitcoin network congestion is still causing issues for people wanting to unload their BTC. Others, choose the prudent method of buying-in via dollar cost averaging. The same exchanges that are limiting people's ability to sell off their BCH are the same exchanges limiting others from buying it. I've halted my weekly buy orders of BTC, while waiting for the exchange to start offering BCH. 

This price volatility is absolutely nothing Bitcoin hasn't seen before.

If you are honestly saying ""this level of dumping has never been seen before in crypto"", it just sounds like you haven't been around long enough. The Bitcoin rollercoaster is as old as Bitcoin.

"> But many people that wanted to sell BCH haven't been able to do so.

I'm not sure how true this is really.  I would think by now most users who wanted to dump BCH for BTC have already done so. Some are pointing to Coinbase for example releasing BCH in January.  But let's think about it:  How many people  kept most of their funds in Coinbase on Aug 1...?  Coinbase at that time had not said they would support BCH at all, and in fact they warned users to withdraw funds prior to the fork if they wanted the forked coin because at that time they were not even promising to convert and release the forked coin to account holders.  Obviouisly Coinbase has a lot of users and accounts, but I assume that most people transferred a majority of their holdings prior to Aug 1 to their hardware wallets or other cold storage, or to exchanges promising to convert post-fork.

On a side note, I have a feeling that a lot of the rhetoric from both sides in terms of unloading all of their BTC for BCH, or all of their BCH for BTC, has been overblown, representing emotional positions on one side or the other.  In reality, one would have to be truly foolish to dump all of one for the other.  It just doesn't make sense to ever put all of your eggs in one basket.  I continue to hold all of both, but even if I were an ideologue on one side or the other, I might hedge by converting some percentage of my BCH to BTC or vice versa, but I would not go all the way and convert 100%.

It may not blow up. It's basically the difference between an ETF and an ETN. With an ETF, an institution buys assets and puts them in a common basket and then sells shares of the basket to investors. That's what Tethers originally claimed they were doing with USD. In an ETN an insurer takes assets and doesn't buy them, but places them into a basket anyway and then sells shares of insurance on this basket claiming they are good for the money as it is collateralized in plenty of other assets. That's not inherently bad, and in fact ETNs have some benefits since they can ride out low liquidity stints without impact when an ETF would be forced to buy or sell in a market where true pricing isn't available. The real issue here is that we aren't seeing transparency as to which kind of derivative Tethers are so that we can determine how much credit risk is involved and what the credit worthiness of the insurer is.;2;1;False;;dpxinbx;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"> When you see yourself opening an LN channel, do you think you'd rather do it on a network where it's nearly free to do so, or on a network where the fee is more than $100? 

BTC can and almost probably will increase the block size at a later stage, possibly after a layer 2 network is ready for the masses. Until then low fees are not a priority on the BTC side, as you have noticed and as became the main reason for the BCH fork for everyone who disagrees.

As soon as something like the lightning network is up and working, which chain will be more attractive? Blockchain A which kept itself relatively small by not clogging itself up with coffee and chewing gum transactions or Blockchain B which is a multitude in size. In addition, Blockchain A will probably offer a higher level of decentralisation because of its smaller nature.

I believe in BTC but I still see why BCH is needed in the shorter term. Because cryptocurrency can be used for transactions here and now and it's awesome. It really is much better than cash in many ways.

> If a super scalable payment system like the envisioned LN is going to happen, there is no guarantee it will only happen on Bitcoin.

That's true and another component why everything is still speculation at this point. There is also a great war going on between the two chains. Keep in mind that there are a lot of crypto millionaires and companies around, each with their own interest in this war.
Most miners probably don't like layer 2 solutions at all because [it takes away some of their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toL1tXrLA1c).
Many core developers are now working for a company called Blockstream and I can understand the critique about that. Blockstream is all pro-lightning and therefore pushes for keeping the blockchain as a secure store of value without any focus on low transaction fees for layer 1.

Also there is a war here on reddit with paid shills on both sides as far as I can judge. There is also censorship in /r/bitcoin which I can't stand and is the reason why I left that channel. One thing that still stays with bitcoin is the fact that whenever a lot of money is in play then big games of power are played. It's one of the things about money that cryptocurrency can't fix. It's best to ignore all that bashing then eventually it will be silenced and we will just see BCH and BTC as two different coins that are here to stay. That's my bet for now, as I'm holding both.

"When it happened to bitcoin, my dear friend, it was due to the collapse of MtGox, maybe you are not in the game that long but I am. By the way, since we're that matter, here is a short video of Roger Ver, bitcoin cash enthusiast shortly before MtGox filed for bankruptcy. I have friends who lost lots of money in MtGox, some people knew there were issues though and luckily I didn't ever use it because it seemed there were problems. But notice who Rog Ver ''knew'' everything was ok;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0

Maybe this will help you understand why Ver is not a trusted player, among other things. In fact, he is despised and loathed by many. He turned his back on bitcoin and the core community, which I think will always prevail. I don't think bitcoin needs change or leadership by anyone, and you should be skeptical following anyone like that. The fact he calls himself ''bitcoin jesus'' is delusional - satoshi would deserve that title, also given his mystery :) If it was all about ''tx fees'' and ''tx speed'' then dogecoin would be better than bitcoin. NO, bitcoin is the best because it is the MOST secure network by hashing power, my friend.

"> Both statements wrong. Interest in BCH is at an all time high according to Google Trends and the coin is also one of the few to get mainstream financial media exposure. 


No, they are not wrong. It only has 4% dedicated to it, everything else comes and go according to profitability and its is struggling even when more profitable to mine. Even elderly people know what Bitcoin is, nobody other than those already into Bitcoin have any idea of what Bitcoin Cash is and its best use case is tipping people on Reddit.

Of course it did an all time high in Google just like the price, people are greedy. Pump anything to the same level and it will have the same effect.

"The major places that are allowing access to BCH only support sell side. For example, Blockchain.info allows its users to transfer BCH out, but not to buy BCH. Coinbase stated that it will allow its users access to BCH in Jan 2018, also to transfer out.

Blockchain.info has already stated that they will eventually fully support BCH, meaning to buy. I am hopeful that Coinbase will also allow full support of BCH including buying on its sister site GDAX.

So, yes, people getting access to BCH currently only have the option to sell. Those of us wanting to buy BCH have fewer options to do so.

"I'm all for lower transaction fees.

However, my view is that BCH is putting the cart ahead of the horses.
Everyone is so focused on lower transaction fees, that they've forgotten that bitcoin and bitcoin cash adoption by merchants is a minor percentage of the market.

Whether we like it or not, the majority of bitcoin is held as a store of value right now. People who have dozens or even hundreds of bitcoins, aren't worried about transaction fees because there is nowhere to really spend their bitcoins. They can't go to the nearest supermarket and buy groceries with bitcoin or bitcoin cash. There's a few merchants where they can buy smallish things and even a few places that accept bitcoin for major purchases (like houses), but the vast majority of people will be using fiat for day to day purchases. Even using bitcoin cash for the ever popular coffee is more of a novelty thing than a day to day occurrence.

This is why I stick to bitcoin. I don't care about buying coffee with my bitcoins. I do care about a long term usability (personally, I'm saving up my bitcoin for a retirement fund). If I can use bitcoin as cash when I need them, in 20 years or so, great. If not, I'll be converting them to fiat.  But I'm not going to be wasting my bitcoins now on coffee when I can simply pull out my atm card, or a couple of coins out of my pocket and buy things that way.

From a long term perspective, all I see is that BCH has set itself up to be controlled by a small group of miners, and BTC is working on a long term decentralised solution (and hopefully bigger blocks).";-1;1;False;foraern;dpwr4i9;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

Cryptocurrencies have the potential to solve problems for people hampered by the monopolies, shitty practices, and legal restrictions of companies like Paypal and Visa, to let people move money across borders with nothing but a memorized wallet seed, to let people move and spend money in genuine privacy.

"You're putting words in my mouth. Maybe try taking what I said at face value.

I'm not talking about buying BCH now, waiting for a month, and then spending it. You know what currencies are good for that? Fiat. No crypto has the stability needed to reliably use it that way. None. You can't buy $400 of X and spend $400 on a Switch a month later. Sure, some might be worth more after the month, but you and I both have no idea which ones that might be. We don't know if your $400 in BTC might be worth $300 thirty days from now, nor do we know if your BCH are going to be worth that much. I wasn't saying that, and it wasn't the point of my comment to begin with.

If you want to place a bet, sure, Bitcoin might be a better bet. Still a bet, though.

As for why you would give two fucks: Because if you don't, the point of cryptocurrency might have gone lost on you while browsing /r/Bitcoin or whatever. The core of the conversation is still about taking power away from banks, not to get rich quick. Hence, the price shouldn't matter as much as the parent comment implied. That's what we should focus on. Not on monthly gains.

I can create 20 BCC users, or pay a BTC fee.  BCC has network effects that BTC does not have anymore, the network effects that brought BTC from $0 - $!,000.  Network effects are more powerful than speculation.  Simply being stable is just a short term effect of momentum.  When BCC processes 10x the transaction volume of BTC, the value at that point must be 10-100X compared to BTC.

"Anywhere from $5-20.  Latest was $12.

And to sum it up for you:  transaction fees are based on satoshi per byte.  Nobody is sending $7400 at a time.  People are transacting $50-100, like they *used* to be able to.  Paying $12 for a $100 transaction is worse than any other method of payment at this point.  Even $5 is ridiculous.  Bitcoin used to be useful for standard transactions and now it is not.

Because bitcoin is based on satoshi/byte transaction fees, the more 1 BTC goes up, the more transaction fees will cost period because it's satoshi/byte.

If btc goes to $15,000, it only means the ponzi scheme worked, but transfer fees will still be ridiculous to transfer normal amounts of money around.  Thus opening a brand new market for a normal, useful bitcoin (hence why BCH was born.)

- Bch is  not the best tech coin but has more marketing from others; awareness/adoption is it s best chance;
- recent bch gains dont look very organic.. so a price drop on a btc gain is normal;
- bch has obvious support from bitmain; bitmain is a very important name in crypto with a big leverage: they control most of the asic supply. (Just knowing the future supply would be a good advantage)
- bitmain sold so so many s9s in the last 1 - 2 months.. they got stocks when btc is very high; china is not bitcoin friendly anymore  -> mining decentralisation..  -> good for btc's

"""Seems more of a psychological than financial support.""

I agree with this. Most people I know holding BCH are only doing so because they don't trust the community and big players. They keep as a just in case scenario and were happy they did this past weekend during all the FUD about a permanent flippening and Ver's big dollars sitting on an exchange, but the pump does them little good unless the price stays up. Also, many youtubers recommended the same thing. Keep both. And they did just that. 

Any new money they have to invest is going into BTC. I personally don't know anyone reinvesting into BCH. Just my experience. Sorry to say but there is a danger to centralizing the currency either way this goes. So, I don't think most people see that argument as all that important. Price and adoption are more important. People with money don't waste money, but conservatives will play it safe and that's why BCH has support at this point in my opinion.

"Bitcoin Cash is gearing up for another run at BTC.

Things are being aligned with BTC being maneuvered onto exchanges ready to be dumped. 

At the same time buy walls will get moved up for BCH to pump the price. As per last weekend, once it gets going FOMO will kick the price onwards. 

Could happen this weekend, could be from the 26th - ideally when BTC gets locked in unable to make any moves to clear transaction backlogs. 

There is a plan and there is muscle behind it. The only question is timing. If BCH hits $3k and BTC $5k nobody will say what will happen next. 

The price today is irrelevant, Stick with BCH or sell - just don't miss out when the gunslingers make their move. ";1;1;False;theprufeshanul;dpwx7c4;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/
"I never understood the path to victory for BCH.  Bitcoin is doing well because a lot of investors, who don't understand or appreciate the tech, want to buy some.  When they buy it, they are all buying BTC.  So the only way to win is for exchanges to call BCH ""bitcoin"" and not even sell BTC.  Xapo and Bitfinex (60ish% of the exchange market) are doing the exact opposite.  BCH is simply not *different* enough to merit them switching to it.  It can't just be a little bit better, it has to be a lot better to merit exchanges abandoning ""legacy"" bitcoin... or a lot more profitable.  I don't think the tech or the transaction times or centralization or anything other than *adoption* is the motivating factor for these markets.  You can call this a bubble or just deflation, but it isn't nearly as intelligent as most here are claiming.  Investors also assumed the housing market was intelligent.  Getting rich is 99% of the motivation for new investors.

"Xapo and Bitmex are dumping customers BCH as we speak and are crediting them with the equivalent market value of BTC. The BTC price is being artificially inflated by the production of USDT (tethers) literally out of thin air creating volume and pumping BTC with little more than pixie dust and rainbow promises.

The volume is high on BCH so people are buying the coins being sold, but there are a large volume of coins being dumped on the markets at this point, causing the drop in price.

The fact that BCH is being pumped and dumped is a great indicator for it's future. If no-one cared enough to buy/sell then the market would be flat and we'd have an issue. The recent extreme pump was always unsustainable and was always going to crash down.

I'm really glad to read this - we have very similar thoughts.  BTC obviously has severe technical drawbacks right now.  There is one factor it seems like a lot of people here aren't considering though, and it's one of the basic rules of cryptocurrency.  BTC has value because people believe it has value.  As long as people keep believing the price will go up and that it's a solid investment, they will buy it.  As sad as it is, I get the feeling that most people buy bitcoin to make money, not because they value or understand the technology.  BTC is arguably also the most talked about in the media, and to someone who isn't heavily involved in the crypto scene, it is probably the only cryptocurrency they know of.  These people likely aren't going to be aware of the problems or alternatives. ;1;1;False;James-Russels;dpx633p;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"Before the huge pump and dump BCH was around $800, so it is not that surprising to see BCH falling back around this value again. 

> it's hard to argue with people calling BCH a pump and dump when it has been pumped and dumped to levels never seen in crypto

BTC price falled quite a bit too ($5500, -15%~) during this pump and dump, so both coins are subject to huge pump and dump.

> While Bitcoin Cash solves some of BTC's problems..It's still dependent on expensive asic equipment to be part of the network..A network that rely basically on one single ASIC provider. and the few chinese farms that have a low enough electricity.

How is it that a problem?  You can't avoid economy of scale.

> Nobody cares if fees and transactions are too high..

High fees are a huge issue for merchants.  In the long run Bitcoin value will depend on how much merchants support it. BCH value will probably slowly increase as more and more businesses accept it instead of BTC.  It is a very long process though.

The thing is that Bitcoin Core has a lot of inertia, even though Bitcoin Core accumulated quite a bit of technical debt.  There is also shaddy stuff going on with Tether and some other exchanges as well.  We couldn't expect BCH to overtake BTC in 3 months, the process will take probably more than a year of two.  In any cases, don't panic on price variation over a week: they are probably meaningless.";1;0;False;s0laster;dpxhvmy;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

I find it actually very strange, almost delusional that someone could believe bitcoin c(r)ash could overtake the almighty bitcoin. A bit of marketing and pump tactics by Roger Ver and Co. and some suckers are forsaking the great satoshi cyberchrist in who we trust.  Pff! You think overnight a group of fraudsters will convince the world to buy some scam fork centralized coin? Please, you need to wake up and smell the coffee. Will bitcoin cash ''die'' no it won't because of the nature of blockchain it's easy to keep alive. But thinking it will overtake bitcoin is far beyond stupid. Just my two cents. People have been saying bitcoin is dead for years... hmm.. really.

"Gold also fits that description. It's not the easiest to carry around, secure or cheap to procure or store. Can't fit it in your wallet. The only thing that gold has going for it is it's name and it's human assisgned value. It's literally a legacy human currency that's turned into a commodity. Yet banks and countries hold , hoard and trade it to fund their fiat and it is, or was, the basis of currency for the longest time. That said, gold does have it's use as jewellery, but i suspect that's a small portion of how gold is actually used financially.

Anywhoo. Bitcoin and the idea of Bitcoin as the progenitor of all crypto currency and the legacy of satoshi is a powerful one. Like a vintage car or gold. And its scarce. These two alone would give it relevance and value. I imagine when I'm a 100 years old my grand children would be impressed that actually owned one whole Bitcoin.

"Having Bitcoin in its name and following all the way to genesis block *is* the reason though. Otherwise you can always take the same tech or some new and shiny tech and start a new blockchain and literally print free money. For currency, the network effect *is* the consideration. You need time to build trust in order for people to use it. I mean, otherwise if someone comes up with Ethereum 2.0 that's way better do we all now switch again?

For Ethereum, I would argue it serves different purposes. The Turing complete nature of Solidity and the VM means there's too much room for error. These DAO and Parity hacks are not isolated incidents and point to a bigger issue. Bitcoin is designed as a currency and the contracts are intentionally limited. In design, more features aren't always better (larger attack surface, more complexities, etc).

"You can dump your own coin with zero fees or just use dogecoin. Fact: The more a network is used the more higher the fees rise. We can't escape that. After a 8MB block one needs a 100MB block, then 1GB blocks etc. It might be possible to scale the network to the size of VISA or paypal. But that's not what people with a vision have in mind. We want microtransactions and single Satoshi transactions. We want THE internet of money, the primary network for value. And that means that value is streamed, not like today sent in blocks of cash or in monthly bill payments. It means realtime money transfer. That network needs to be able to process around 10^6 the number of transactions VISA handles daily. No block size increase will fix that. We will need higher layers on top of a secure value store for that matter.

If you want/need to spend money in crypto today use Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin etc. But that's obvious and doesn't even need to be said, because no one will pay super high fees for a coffee.
Bitcoin (BTC) takes it slow with increasing the blockchain's size, because it envisions something much greater than what we have today and sees every coffee transaction written in the blockchain as a waste of space. It's a completely different approach, but it has it's right to exist.

I was with you until this. The high fees is literally *the* problem facing Bitcoin now. People don't use Bitcoin for coffee now because they literally can't, not due to lack of desire. Even for online shopping or donations, I hesitate to pay in BTCs these days since so much of the money goes to fees instead of the recipient. This leads to a feedback loop with merchants dropping out, etc.

People are going to find a solution either way, either with BCH, or other cryptocurrency, or maybe even just go back with good old ACH/credit cards. Solutions solve problems for people, not the other way round with people fitting themselves for a solution.

"My long term investment thesis is as follows:


* bitcoin/cryptocurrencies will never go away. By their nature, even if there's a UN resolution banning the exchange of crypto for fiat, it will go underground, barter, etc. If such a thing happened, price would probably be depressed for a long time, but it's not going away, just like the internet's not going away.

* I want to promote this view a bit more, to get it out there and see what people in the community think about it, but here it is: I think bitcoin/cryptos have a really interesting use case for microtransactions. Say you want to charge $0.000001 for something like a newspaper article, or a song. Right now you kinda can't, not with Visa/Paypal/etc. But this is easy to do with cryptocurrencies that have low fees (yes, that's a swipe at BTC). If crypto's can scale, and if/when someone finds a cool high-volume use case for microtransactions, then we will see real demand to cryptos and the price will start making sense.


As relates to BTC vs. BCH.... I've already swiped BTC. The high fees are ridiculous... Lightning Network is cool, but after reading many posts on reddit/medium/twitter from various core devs, I am concerned that they've adopted an extremist view when it comes to decentralization and are not focused on scaling in a practical way. For BCH, fees are low, developers (i.e. deadalnix) seem reasonable, but not a lot of activity going on in terms of scaling beyond blocksize increase, so there's risk with BCH that not enough manpower/resources/innovation will materialize to scale it before some top 30 coin gets everyone's attention and usurps both BTC/BCH.


Conclusion: BTC/BCH have brand recognition that other coins do not, which is not to be underestimated, but do have non-trivial issues without clear solutions. Other coins are interesting. So invest a good bit into BTC/BCH and throw a little bit at the alt-coins to hedge your bets. Re-evaluate as necessary.

"9/10 for concern trolling

Give it time... the coin is 3 months old and consolidating $700-$1200.

It has:

- Relatively small but very involved community

- Supported by some of the biggest BTC miners

- Decentralized development

- Well known BTC devs (from before core) openly supporting BCH

- Some high profile early BTC adopters openly supporting BCH

- Possible support from ""segwit2x"" companies in the near future.

BCH is gaining ground in areas BTC lost long ago:

- gambling

- remittances

- commerce

- Hell, even gimmicks like u/tippr are back

Most importantly:

No scaling issues on the short - mid term, BCH can scale up to 32MB blocks.

BTC scaling depends 100% on off-chain lighting networks and side-chains, both are still vaporware and at least ~18 months away.
The other core ""product"" Segwit has stalled at ~10% adoption, and even with full 100% adoption it will never reach more than ~2mb scaling.

So why is bitcoin going up?

Easy, everybody is buying it for the sole purpose of selling it to the greater fool. At least that is what I'm doing, I hope BTC will go to 30k so I can dump my profits on the newbs. I leave my bitcoins on the exchange, I don't even bother using the network anymore. That's NOT a healthy sign!

BCH has huge practical advantages over BTC, and if this was 2015 it would have already overtaken the rival chain.

Don't forget, BCH is also competing ETH, which has more infrastructure/exchanges in place, and also costs much less to do even faster transactions than BCH.

Which is exactly what we are seeing. People are realizing Bitcoin's future is way more promising than Bch. This to me looks like people are jumping in the Bitcoin train.

Even though Bch is at a  alltime low since the Bump & dump. It may very well be part of a end-game scheme yet and I do think it's gonna bounce up a little bit, but not as high as it has been. My prediction is 1200 by the end of week and then people will probably start dumping it for good which means the prices will dip back to sub 600 tresh hold.

There are tons of cryptocurrencies that have better features than bitcoin, but the first mover advantage is huge and gives bitcoin dominance a lot of inertia.  BCH has the advantage over other contenders in that it mostly shares the ownerbase with bitcoin, making it financially easier for people to transition to using BCH from BTC. On the other hand, BCH doesn't (at least yet) fix all of bitcoins weaknesses, such as lacking full anonymity, or support for smart contracts.

If BCH is going to take over bitcoins role it's not going to happen overnight.  The inertia of all the infrastructure and valuation tied into bitcoin is too great for that.

"I agree with some of your points. And I share your concern.

However your statement that Bitcoin is a better store of value I think is fud. It's not. In fact, I still think segwit can be used to steal funds.

But until that attack actually happens, it isn't a very motivating factor for most people who don't understand the protocol. And I could be wrong too (but I doubt it).

Bitcoin is also dominated by the big bankers. They want everyone in Bitcoin because that's where they are putting trojan horses in and pushing towards centralization.

But your point that people don't really use cryptos is bang on. The value of bitcoin, and others, is probably 99% Ponzi scheme at the moment. The only difference is that this has the POTENTIAL to be used for currency...but yes you are right when you say this isn't the current use ... People are just buying and holding hoping to get an increase....which is why it's all a Ponzi.

And the best Ponzi to be in is the biggest one there is. So that's Bitcoin.

And BCH could die. All cryptos can die and be replaced by something not even on the market yet.

But BTC is the first and there is more infrastructure built around it than all other cryptos combined. And that isn't something you can just toss out the window....that infrastructure will keep BTC valuable even if their fundamentals go to the shitter.

"> -Some people put giant buy walls on BCH. Yet I don't see them buying..Seems more of a psychological than financial support..

The buy wall is an indication that he may be going into a permanent pump and dump. actually, no dump. its just a sustained pump for potentially  infinity. Its also profitable to do this as well. 

BTC and BCH are correlated. When the fork happened, everyone got the same number of both coins. That means that its very possible for someone to get enough coins together to just begin an unlimited pump attack on the other coin.

I have explained this a bunch of times tonight. If you look at the first attack you can see that when one coin goes up the other goes down. The previous attack shows that you can potentially do this indefinitely until the coins eventually meet in the middle or some outside force intervenes. 

Oh and another thing, the more BCH goes down and the more BTC goes up the more force will be applied to BTC when it begins.

"What Bitcoin has become, is not what it was meant to be. If you want to hold and don't care about blowing $50 on a single transaction, that's for you.

Bitcoin was created to build a decentralized and free (independent) trustless economy. We all knew its value would go up over time but, I don't think ""stock"" exchanges were ever in Satoshi's eyes. It was meant to buy, sell and trade for goods, services as an alternative to international fiat... Of course, the miners and early adopters needed to find a way to utilize their coin and it couldn't function without a connection to fiat, which loses value every day, hence a way to create wealth outside of the centralized financial economy...

People got greedy. That's why we have hodlers and not spedners. The early adopters build their wealth with the exchange of goods services and currency conversions. Early adopters sold their BTC for big ticket items... 

If it isn't going to be used for it's actual purpose, and only becomes a store of value for money to make more money, if it can't/won't be used to buy goods and services, it ends up being as worthless as fiat.

So mining became less profitable, while bitcoin gained higher demand and we need the miners to confirm the transactions. Of course, the cost of transactions had to go up. It went up in proportion to the value of the coin and the difficulty of solving blocks... Miners should be receiving a reward for mining that is profitable. Users are complaining about the cost while ignoring the basis of bitcoin's creation. More miners should be mining. More service and retail providers should be accepting Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin gained more hodling value than use cases and, still has not managed to go mainstream. Something had to change.  Who says the cost of Bitcoin Cash transactions will never go up? 

Ultimately, the way Bitcoin has gone, without a drastic increase in value and rewards, none of this has been fair to the miners.";2;0;False;HooRYoo;dpx9cur;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"I looked at a few charts yesterday and noticed an odd disconnect between normal market movements and BCC. BTC, ETH, and even some other smaller cryptos behaved according to their normal correlations while BCC traded sideways. Because of this I have been suspicious about whether BCC is being manipulated. 

As it stands, the Bitcoin project is a fail (to my standards). BCC is part of the Bitcoin project by extension. All intrinsic value has been fragmented or is simply non-existent. All it has left is the network effect and less businesses are accepting it everyday. I’m seeing the Bitcoin option DISAPPEAR from places that accepted in the past. Theres no functional value to the coin and its only good as a speculative asset to make money from. It’s not fully private, not stable, not fast, not convenient, not widely accepted, not decentralized, and not immune to manipulation over all. 

I will continue to speculate in BTC at the expense of others. Thats all there’s left to do until we see a major innovation. Other cryptos have far surpassed BTC in terms of conceptual and technological innovation, and the development communities have proven to be more competent and less abrasive. Once a more consumer facing “solution”, or package of benefits, is put together using all that knowledge, we’ll see a true king of crypto emerge.

"A long term investor -- one who's willing to wait 5-10 years -- is betting on which coin will still be standing in a future where bitcoin has reached mainstream adoption. Imagine that crypto transaction volume is 500 times higher than today's volume. Neither BTC nor BCH could handle that many transactions. 

Through it's messaging, the BCH camp is signalling that it will increase volume by increasing the base block size. ""Satoshi's original vision of on-chain scaling"" ""gigabyte block testing"" etc. That may work for a while, but in a decade, huge blocks guarantee that BCH will be centralized in an ever-shrinking number of datacenter-based nodes.

In the BTC camp, the dev team is pushing layer 2 solutions like Lightning which might actually allow scaling to the global level. If not, layer 3 certainly will.

"Do you even know how LN works?

LN is a sidechain (lacks security) where you ""transfer"" (in reality lend/lock) bitcoins from a user to another while not putting those transactions on the chain. It's an escamotage, it's no longer p2p, it's less secure and has a shitton of technical problems and it probably doesn't work. You also need to create multiple channels and thus divide your money. 

This is a nice article, read also the comments and the following up article where he tackles most criticism of his article (and the comments to the article too, read both sides).

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

Not only that, shutting down or regulating bitcoin is extremely hard as you have no way to control the single actors.

This is totally different (and breaks U.S. law probably) with LN because each actor is no longer a **user** but an **exchanger**:

https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf

 *The administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between persons or from one location to another. This conclusion applies, whether the value is denominated in a real currency or a convertible virtual currency.*

Lignthing Network is purely unworkable, probably illegal and will fuck up Bitcoin, no matter the propaganda spread from /r/bitcoin and you must as dumb as a shoe to believe in that. And you don't fuck up with U.S. tax agencies, ever. It's bullshit promoted to calm people while fees are rising and transactions are slow. 

""Oh but we will have LN, lolol, solve scalability"".

Blockchains are databases, at some point you need to increase the number of rows in your database.

Each other solution **is not p2p**, it's risky from much too may reasons, it's slavery to somebody's interest to take fees for routing transactions that are **very** centralized and needs tons of liquidity.

Please, read what I wrote with attention, then read even people that will call my comments as bullshit, and form an opinion, because LN can potentially kill the entire crypto ecosystem and bring unrecoverable losses to crypto markets.";15;2;False;ep1939;dpwoz5h;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"**Spoofing (finance)**

Spoofing is a disruptive algorithmic trading entity employed by traders to outpace other market participants and to manipulate commodity markets. Spoofers feign interest in trading futures, stocks and other products in financial markets creating an illusion of exchange pessimism in the futures market when many offers are being cancelled or withdrawn, or false optimism or demand when many offers are being placed in bad faith. Spoofers bid or offer with intent to cancel before the orders are filled. The flurry of activity around the buy or sell orders is intended to attract other high-frequency traders (HFT) to induce a particular market reaction such as manipulating the market price of a security.

If a super scalable payment system like the envisioned LN is going to happen, there is no guarantee it will only happen on Bitcoin. When you see yourself opening an LN channel, do you think you'd rather do it on a network where it's nearly free to do so, or on a network where the fee is more than $100? The expensive network will have to have some very enticing characteristics for me to pay that kind of fee, which is in my opinion currently not the case for Bitcoin.

Exactly, hating and abandoning BTC because you like BCH is incredibly shortsighted and dangerous since BTC remains the gold standard of cryptocurrencies.

"Yes, markets are more complex than to have a single point of change; but most investors are followers who acts without critical thinking.

When tethers broke every single correction and prevented a health growth, a pattern emerged in which people think it will only go up; because it has only gone up.

Institutional investers going into bitcoin at it's most controversial turmoil in history doesn't seem particulary credible.

I'm just honestly afraid that this bubble has no underlying fundamentals and will eventually burst. Even non-crypto bubbles that grows on speculation bursts; this is nothing special or uncommon.

Furthermore, I'm not blaming it only on tether, I am blaming it on a combination of tether issuance, wash trading and a large information control campaign.

"Tether is actually a tangible issue compared to ""Roger and Jihan are the devil"" nonsense however.

Nearly $600 Million in Tether has been created at this point. They invented a fiat to trade against that is not directly linked to any fiat bank to withdraw to, which is simply fraudulent any way you look at it.

While I agree in some ways the issue is overblown by some, but still significant and cannot be ignored either. I think this will end up blowing up in their faces eventually.

"Thank you for sharing the Android and Windows market share chart. 

My understanding is their dominance is derived by a two-sided network effect: users go where the apps are and developers go where the users are. Google and Microsoft fueled this two-sided network effect by giving away their platform and developer tool kits away for free (respectively); thus, creating an incentive for developers to create apps when there were limited users. 

It is evident BCH (USD, EUR, etc.) is driven by one-sided network effects: more users make the network more powerful (e.g. a telephone is not useful if you are the only one with a telephone).

**My question: does BCH have any two-sided network effects?** My suspicion is yes, or it will in the future, but I can not put my finger on it. I would like to hear the community's thoughts on this.

For example, Ethereum has the potential to be driven by a two-sided network effect: developing smart contracts that users want (although I do not see a ""killer app"" today). My fear with Ethereum is that the code is ""immutable"" and combined with decentralized smart contract development is a recipe for disaster (e.g. DAO hack, and Parity multi-signature wallet fiasco).

">Pricing out 99%? What? I would assume you're aware you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Im not sure what you even mean with that argument

[As of now, the cheapest, most efficient fee a user should give for a transaction is over $8.](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com) What I mean with this argument is that 99% of the world cannot transact with the 1mb chain. They have been priced out because the fee is more than the value most people make in a day. 

>Eventually only large (dare i say coorperate) mining pools will be able to mine. With that, those large groups can control the currency and manipulate it whichever way they please

This is the case now. We already have large centralized mining pools who compete with eachother. They are incentivized not to cheat because they make more money by mining than any way they could cheat. I think you may have confused centralized mining with centralized relay nodes. Increased blocksize would increase the overhead, as you say, in running a relay node. Relay nodes don't have an economic incentive to exist, so the argument goes that running one should be as cheap as possible. I understand that concern. But what's the point of running a node when you can't transact? 8mb blocks isn't going to price many people out of running a relay node. 1mb blocks *is* pricing a lot people out of bitcoin. 

>How did BCH have a hard fork a few days ago yet the decision to do that was decided by around 3 people? BCH has a CEO ffs. How exactly is this the ""currency nobody can control"" again?

BCH had a hardfork (there was a little drama tbh) that everyone went along with because we all agreed it needed to be done. BitcoinABC took the initiative and unilaterally declared the algorithm we'd use, citing that in the future any hardforks should have more discussion. In the meantime all BCH users are pleased with the results so far. It was a successful hardfork upgrade. 

>Im starting to see proponents of BCH have their heart in the right place and maybe not all are malicious. You are just being played by a skilled con artist (Ver). While im not worried about BCH in the least as its decline has already begun

I thank you for your open mind. TBH I also see most core supporters as genuine Bitcoin supporters who have been played. I've laid out most of my reasoning already (bitcoin being turned into bankcoin by corporate/banksters). 

>id encourage you to do a little more research and then decide which of the currencies is actually decentralized and closer to the currency you are describing

I've done plenty of research and I always keep an open mind. When one talks about decentralization, one must consider the different types of centralization. It is true the bigger blocks will lead to more centralized nodes, but it is a spectrum. 8mb today will not lead to huge datacentres. 
Furthermore, the type of centralization that many core enthusiasts neglect to consider is the centralization of usability. With high fees and slow confirmation times (not to mention RBF which kills 0-conf), Bitcoin is becoming centralized among the rich and affluent.

Bitcoin is supposed to bank the unbanked. This is impossible with today's 1mb bitcoin chain. This is why I made the switch to Bitcoin Cash.

I'm gonna forget about all the technological part of BCH and BTC. How each one is better in some aspect. The reason why I'm not fully into BCH is really because BCHers are not trying to increase BCH's price/value. But because BCHers are actively trying to reduce BTC's value/price. Millions of people have invested in BTC. Not a single one of them want to see their money and investment go down. BCHers seem like that's what they are trying to do.

These people don't give a fuck about blocksize. BCHers seem like scumbags when they try to make people poorer. I wish BCHers can focus on making BCH better and more valuable. But you cannot do that without destroying BTC. The prince of BCH is manipulating thousands and thousands of people with his bitcoin.com address. This is a scammy move.

"**Network effect**

A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.

The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.

I don’t downvote blindly. I have spent a considerable amount of time learning how the bitcoin network actually operates, and came to the conclusion that bitcoin core are actively pursuing an agenda that hobbles the performance of the bitcoin network to force people onto their own proprietary closed source layer 2 solutions. I also reached the conclusion that scaling on chain is not an unachievable goal and will not lead to centralisation of miners. Mining ASICS are getting better and cheaper and we are starting to see new technology developments o make it even better and more accessible. It may mean that you can no longer run bitcoin on a shitty old laptop, but I’d rather have a robust and usable global payment system than something that gets clogged up if more than half a million transactions are conducted in one day. ;0;1;False;The_Beer_Engineer;dpvql9w;BAM! $7150;7d3n5z;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d3n5z/bam_7150/

The properties of bitcoin make it valuable. It is scarce, which helps drive the price up a lot. It is useful, as you no longer need to hold money in the bank. The blockchain makes it incorruptible. People want bitcoin. In fact, so many want it that the price is skyrocketing. You can't just mine some bitcoin due to the difficulty and scarcity, so the price keeps increasing. The increasing price is an effect of bitcoin, not the cause of bitcoin. The reason people choose bitcoin is because it is the biggest by market cap, most secure due to amount of nodes, and most immutable. The other cryptos don't have nearly as much demand which is why they are so much faster. A blockchain by design isn't fast, but it is extremely safe and atomic.

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude.

Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

As described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."" Hence, the corollary to the Dunning–Kruger effect indicates that persons of high ability tend to underestimate their relative competence and erroneously presume that tasks that are easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform.

"My gf is a professional jeweler so I hear a lot about this haha so forgive me, but no: the quality of fine jewelry vs. fashion, or even diamond vs. moissanite are usually visible (maybe not to a dumb guy like me, but to a lot of jewelry consumers). But that’s beside the point. Diamonds are by no means a scarce object, but because the De Beers company has full control over the supply, they determine the flow into the market, and therefore determine the price. Centralization at its finest.

If the purpose of using BitCoin is to do away with centralization and put financial power back into the hands of the people, then it’s not doing a very good job of that right now. BitCoin has become much more centralized than I believe people want it to be. If it’s supposed to be “your own bank” and a *good* “store of value,” then why would anyone ever pay ~$20-$40 for minuscule withdrawals or transactions if they can use any centralized bank (assuming that fees may ultimately be more important to people than decentralization)? 

The only reason people keep investing in it right now is because the price keeps appreciating. Why? “Just because.” Well at that rate, we really *are* looking at tulip mania then. If there isn’t a practical use case, then this is all just a house of cards waiting to cave in. I know that might not be a popular opinion, but I have a hard time seeing it any other way.

">I know the value. I just understand that blockchains can’t scale on chain. 

That just mean you suck at scaling, 8MB blocks work fine in Bitcoin Cash, and we can do 1G blocks in testnet. Storage technology is progressing rapidly, faster than Bitcoin itself. So don't play dumb.

That's why I know for a fact you're either not a software engineer, or you are paid off to talk bullshit out of your ass.

Bottom line is Bitcoin today can scale to 32MB blocks easy, by the time we reach 32MB blocks, we're looking into billions of users, the Bitcoin economy will be 50 times greater than today, there will be at least 5x the number of nodes and super nodes in the data center.

Using Raspberry Pi as an excuse is total bullshit. You can only do that if you ignore the fact that node number will grow with the economy, corporation will run their own full nodes just like they run their own webserver. At that point you no longer needs nodes on Raspberry Pi.

**Only economic retards focus on running full nodes on Raspberry Pis. Only tech retards claim we can't scale beyond Raspberry Pis.**

>Bitcoin as a reserve currency is what this is about. As is today, it’s meant to move large sums of money. And that makes sense when that spot on the blockchain is expensive.

No, Bitcoin was created as a cash system, that's why the whitepaper is titled ""Bitcoin: Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", Satoshi already worked out how to scale Bitcoin, don't play dumb and dont make shit up just because bankers took over Bitcoin development.

If you want a banker settlement coin, you're free to create your own, just don't fuck around with a ""Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

I didn't say it was to be only a store of value. I said it is one of the safest sores of value. If Bitcoin becomes everything it can be, it will most definitely be a store of value since it gives you complete control without trusted third parties and risk of censorship. You will always be able to pay for things with bitcoin and you can send them anywhere you want in true p2p fashion. If there are separate networks where people transact on (L2) it is perfectly fine as the underlying currency is Bitcoin and not government issued fiat. Finally, increasing the blocksize only increases centralization. These problems will be solved, however it is more important that bitcoin stays decentralized than that transactions are quicker and cheaper. Decentralization is several orders of magnitude more important even, considering the government will eventually be the next challenger. Increasing adoption, having more nodes and fixing mining cheats will help bitcoin stay decentralized.;1;1;False;sz1a;dpvtok9;BAM! $7150;7d3n5z;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d3n5z/bam_7150/

"Then again

Who owns Blockstream?

What I had long suspected was confirmed tonight. Blockstream (who funds Core) is in the pocket of Central Bankers. Blockstream is owned by Digital Currency Group. If you look at their managers/directors/advisors, its a ""who's who"" of Central Bankers.

Think about that for a minute. Who is deciding against 2mb, 4mb, or even bigger blocks? A group that is funded by an arm of Central Bankers. What do Central Bankers have? Experience. Centuries worth. They've been spreading FUD and misinformation for decades, for centuries.

Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.

Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.

Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor"" ""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks], and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the International Advisory Board of Santander Group, and Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce.

"What's your definition of ""Bitcon""? It's not as clear cut as you think. I don't think Core devs nor exchanges get to define it as they wish, as otherwise that will destroy the whole notion of a decentralized currency. I think everyone agrees for something to be called ""Bitcoin"", the chain has to originate from the [genesis block](https://blockchain.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f) (otherwise it's clearly an alt coin, even if it shares the same tech). If a **hard fork** happens though (which BCH is), you need some way to decide which chain is the ""Bitcoin"" chain, unless you call both ""Bitcoin"" at the same time.

One way to define it is ""**the popular chain** that reaches back to the original mined block"". Key here being ""popular"", which is not a clearly defined term. One sort of clear way to determine that is [Gavin's proposal](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin) which defines it as the longest cumulative difficulty chain. BCH isn't there yet, but if we agree to use that definition that means it's a fluid concept and BCH can reach that if more people jump on board. The other definition is price/market cap, and again, while BCH isn't there, it does mean it's possible for BCH to overtake BTC.

* Note that both definitions (price/market cap vs difficulty) are usually synonymous in the long term because miners distribution will generate follow price/difficulty in order to maximize profits, and any difference from that will be arbitraged away.

Another way is to define it as ""**the coin that follows the true vision** of Bitcoin / whitepaper"". Again, this is subjective. I do think BCH follows it a lot more, but hey, I can see why people disagree on this. Either way, even if that's your metric, it's not like BCH is ""stealing"" the name of ""Bitcoin"" just because it's forking. You can just as easily argue the current BTC chain with SegWit and other features is ""stealing"" the Bitcoin name, with a hostile takeover of the Core repo (which is a *reference* implementation, not bible).

The worst way to define it is ""because r/bitcoin or Core says so"". Who gave Core the authority to define such things? What about Gavin? Is he not the rightful maintainer of the currency? Who gets to define who the members of Core are? Do we even want such power in only a few developers anyway?

1. Streaming video bitrates are unlikely to continue to grow that much beyond where they are now, even if you double or triple the bit-rates we start to reach the limits of what's necessary to display an image at the sort of screen sizes we use in our home. I'm quite confident that Adoption will drive increases in global bandwidth but at some point internet streaming will plateau.

2. 32MB block is still incredibly small and would equate to roughly 100tps. A drop in the ocean compared to the vision for crypto and the kind of TPS it will need to handle.

3. Crypto being p2p is somewhat different to streaming which is centralised. Capacity and propagation is a completely different proposition.

Markets will likely open in a few days once the chain gets deeper. Will be difficult to split coins since BCH chose not to implement replay protection when they forked off Bitcoin Clashic.

The transactions on the BCH chain are vulnerable to a block reorganization once the Clashic chain gets the most accumulated work. Since BCH has only a tiny fraction of the BTC hashrate it would not be prohibitively difficult or expensive to overwrite the BCH chain.

Holding funds in BCH you are trusting that 5-20% of the hashrate will be able to protect against 95-80% of the hashrate in the event of a malicious attack by miners. It doesn't even require a ""51%"" attack; it only requires a 5-20% attack.

You might aswell go over to r/ethereum and tell everyone there that all their smart contracts are ""ether substitutes"" and dont use real ether.

Smart contracts are trustless, they work as programmed.

"> But I think that you need to make a concession here that there are two options: Continue to increase block size on regular intervals that will have larger MB increased and shorter time between or admit that eventually your currency will hit a wall. Any other solution would be off chain ""banking"", to use your word.

I'm not sure I follow. *I don't know* if we'll eventually ""hit a wall.""  To me, any such wall is likely so far ahead that the question today is pretty much academic. But it doesn't really matter to my argument which is simply that we can't arbitrarily limit block size. If the real technological capacity wall is way up ahead at 1-GB and we continue to hold in place an artificial wall at 1-MB, that opens the door to Bitcoin being outcompeted by an alternative that doesn't self-limit itself to such an extreme an unnecessary degree.

>I just simply cannot see how this will ever be true.

Read [this paper](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf) and [this follow-up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6m815r/inflation_is_not_required_for_a_transaction_fee/).

>I completely agree with this, however I'd argue that while traditional banking is governed by shitty people, this type of risk is managed by non-biased code.

Ok, but  shitty people don't go away. It's true that your ""bank"" (""hub"") in a LN scenario doesn't have complete custodial control over your money as would be the case in traditional banking, but the potential opportunity for them to defraud you still exists. 

>The hinge on my argument is that transactional friction is on a lower tier of concern than the fidelity of your network.

Ok, but absolute comparisons like that are meaningless.  So you want to claim that fidelity is ""more important"" than transactional friction? Well, what does that imply? That we should *reduce* the block size limit further? Maybe down to 1kb? Because that would obviously render the network completely unusable (thereby massively undermining its ""fidelity"").  Does it imply that we should keep the 1-MB limit in place forever? Because that would obviously eventually have the same effect.  The question is one of *tradeoffs*.  And that's why IF a limit is needed, it can't be set arbitrarily or inflexibly.  The goal instead should be to set it at the point where the marginal benefits of allowing larger blocks begin to be outweighed by the marginal costs, which (again, IF a limit is even needed) is going to be a moving target (and, one would assume, a target that moves *upward* over time as technology improves).

>I agree both chains have their issues, but it just seems to be like BCH has backed themselves into a corner for their long term solution, while BTC is still attempting to innovate and find one.

Well, again, I don't think there is any real ""long term solution"" that can magically avoid the need to allow scaling of the blockchain proper.  And I don't think BCH has backed itself into a corner. For that matter, I don't *really* think BTC has either. Both chains are really just their ledgers.

"Exactly; BCH in particular is vulnerable to chain reorganization because it has a small minority of BTC hashrate. 

It only takes a few percent of the BTC hashrate to threaten a chain reorganization on BCH.

For instance; the DAA hardfork that took place on Nov 13th created a permanent chain split of BCH and BCH Classic (with the EDA).

The EDA once active will drastically reduce the difficulty on the BCH Classic Chain and eventually become ""profitable"" for miners to mine. In the same way the BCH overtook BTC's blockheight; BCH Classic will overtake BCH blockheight; but because the ecosystem has not had time to fully upgrade it is quite possible that BCH Classic overwrites the BCH chain transaction history.

There is a reason that major ""upgrades"" need to be included several releases in advance before activating. This gives the ecosystem time to update their nodes and services to protect against such an attack.

BCH has no competitive advantage. It is not concerned about protecting ""immutability"" nor does it have the fastest, least expensive, and/or most private transactions. It is a 3month old network that is accepted basically nowhere. There is no infrastructure for BCH. It is highly centralized at every level; miners, nodes, ownership.

In addition to that; its price is artificially inflated because only ""active"" Bitcoiners and traders even know about the BCH airdrop. There are plenty of people that have no intention of holding their BCH other than the fact that they went through a lot of trouble setting up cold-storage methods that they don't want to compromise for a 15% gain.

BCH is only relevant at all because it attempts to take advantage of Bitcoin name recognition and network effect through an airdrop. Many coins have tried this before (I think I still have some CLAMS).

If BCH were launched as its own coin today it would not gain any adoption on its own merits. Bitcoin is more stable and secure; and many other options for fast cheap transactions.

Sorry but BCH is a scam coin.

"BCH has undergone 2 forks in less than 6months and has created two new currencies in the process (BCH and BClashic)

The latest hardfork was done without really any time for the network to upgrade. A major fork like this should have been included in clients several releases in advance of activation; to help ensure the network doesn't bifurcate. The only way that the network could have upgraded in time is if it was highly centralized.

So either BCH is highly centralized and proved this by undergoing a hardfork without contention (you always have consensus when there is no real community to appeal to) ; or the BCH/BClashic fork was rushed ; in which case it created another rift in the community.

There are plenty of people that believe that the DAA ""upgrade"" was rushed and did not have enough testing. 

There is now real risk that not all nodes and services upgraded; and now that BClashic is being mined; it is possible that it gains enough hashpower to overtake total work performed and Blockheight; and just completely wipe out all the transactions on the BCH chain since the split.

BCH is actually one of the MOST mutable chains in existence. It shares absolutely none of the properties that currently give Bitcoin value; and it doesn't have anywhere near the Tx capacity and privacy of other chains.

I remember satoshi's vision being ""every user is a node"", ""One node one vote"".

">I think you've missed my point. I'm not concerned with slippery slope, 

Really? ""it's the precedent being set that every time you run into a scale wall that increasing block size is the solution.""  That's not a slippery slope argument?


> You yourself have admitted that this will eventually be a problem:

No, I answered my question with a ""maybe."" I'm actually pretty skeptical that it will ever be necessary to impose a ""consensus rule""- style ""block size limit"" that functions as a binding economic constraint because I believe that the natural limits on block size will be sufficient.

> so going on that logic you're admitting that eventually we will need alternate solutions to block-size scaling.

No, I really haven't. I've repeatedly argued that there are no ""alternate solutions.""  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:

So-called ""layer two solutions"" aren't ""scaling""; they're *banking*. The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it. (Consider, for example, [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)) There's nothing inherently *wrong* with ""layers."" There will always be a natural balance between money proper (on-chain transactions) and various money substitutes (things like the proposed LN or even just simple fully-custodial banking models). The problem with an arbitrary limit on the transactability of the money proper is that it distorts this balance.

>The idea that we should ""just do what we can today, so that maybe things will work out tomorrow"" is how the United States got in trouble with military spending, social security, debt buying/selling, college loans, federal reserve inflation... etc... and is exactly the reason that people are losing faith in governments.

I don't really see how that applies.  My basic point is pretty simple.  Transactional friction is cancer for money or anything that aspires to become money because literally the entire purpose of money is to *reduce* transactional friction.

The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

">Really? ""it's the precedent being set that every time you run into a scale wall that increasing block size is the solution."" That's not a slippery slope argument?

You're right, my argument was framed as a slippery slope. But I think that you need to make a concession here that there are two options: Continue to increase block size on regular intervals that will have larger MB increased and shorter time between **or** admit that eventually your currency will hit a wall. Any other solution would be off chain ""banking"", to use your word.

> I believe that the natural limits on block size will be sufficient.

I just simply cannot see how this will ever be true. Every time historically we've though that something would ""be enough for the future"" we've been proven wrong. Edit: Please elaborate here because maybe I don't fully understand your argument.

>So-called ""layer two solutions"" aren't ""scaling""; they're banking. The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk.

I completely agree with this, however I'd argue that while traditional banking is governed by shitty people,  this type of risk is managed by non-biased code. Though I am certainly not arguing that this type of thing comes without consequences, certainly the one you mentioned.

>I don't really see how that applies. My basic point is pretty simple. Transactional friction is cancer for money or anything that aspires to become money because literally the entire purpose of money is to reduce transactional friction. (Expanded thoughts here.) Thus, to the extent a binding limit on capacity is needed, it can't be set arbitrarily or inflexibly.

The hinge on my argument is that transactional friction is on a lower tier of concern than the fidelity of your network.

"Ok. Lets start at ground zero. Today. 4 transactions per second.

Moores law states that to keep the same level of node operation as we have today then the blocksize should double every 2 years (50% per year as you put it).

In 14 years from now that gives you 512 transactions per second.

So you are assuming this will be enough, In a decade and a half from now.

If in 14 years from now you have say 1 billion users, thats enough capacity to give every user one transaction every 22.6 days before your blocks clog up. Say you want all 1 billion future users to have 1 transaction per day? Ok, so then start now at 128 transactions per second (around 32mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for 14 years and each of your future users can have 1 transaction per day. 

Maybe you might want each future user to have 10 transactions per day? Ok start today at 1280 transactions per second (lets say 512 mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for 14 years.

If you want to have 1 billion users in 14 years from now each allowed 10 transactions per day. Then you have to be willing to have 512mb blocks TODAY and double that every 2 years for the next 14 years along with moores law. If you cant have 512mb blocks TODAY then you cant even have 10 transactions per user per day in 14 years from now.

But thats just dreaming. A network that only allows 10 transactions per user per day is useless. In 14 years each user will be streaming money, each smart device will be streaming money, im guessing each user will need atleast the capacity for 1 transaction per minute plus lets say theres an extra 1 billion smart devices as users. So at a MINIMUM, 2 billion users each requiring 1140 transactions per day. Thats 26,388,888 transactions per second (26 million transactions per second).To get to that point following moores law means you need to start TODAY with 206,163 transactions per second (close enough to 64GB blocks).

So, if you cannot handle 64 GIGABYTE blocks TODAY and then continue to double that every 2 years folowing moores law, you will never be able to handle anywhere near enough transaction traffic in the future.

If the start is now and the goal is 14 years from now and you try to keep up with this level of growth, im guessing within the next 3 to 5 years your blockchain will be controlled by a conglomorate of a few global miners (most likely government agencies) who have ALL the power, can censor any transactions they want and alter the protocol in any way they want. And you definitely wont be able to run a node to independently validate your own transaction.

The ONLY way to scale safely is using smart contracts and keeping the blocksize as small as possible for as long as possible.

"**Moore's law**

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).

Certainly I've seen *some* people say that. (Have you really not seen anyone suggest that Bitcoin base protocol should be ""immutable""?)

That at least implicitly acknowledges my point, that so-called ""second-layer solutions"" are imperfect substitutes for on-chain transactions.  

And what do you mean by ""as small as possible""? Should Bitcoin miners soft fork the base block size limit down from 1-MB? Do you mean that block size should be as small as possible *without* creating an absolutely terrible user experience and destroying every use case other than pure speculation? Because I'd say we already waved bye-bye to that point. And ""conservative""? This bizarre insistence on clinging to a crude, arbitrary, and always-intended-to-be-temporary limit long after it's become inadequate, while Bitcoin hemorrhages use cases and users to competitors as the network becomes increasingly and absurdly unusable -- that's not conservatism, that is recklessness.   The ""conservative"" approach is not to be conservative with respect to Bitcoin's *code* (i.e., by not changing the value of a single constant from a 1 to a 2) -- but rather to be conservative with respect to Bitcoin's *fundamental mode of operation*. In other words, the conservative approach would involve a modest increase in the block size limit that would allow Bitcoin to continue operating in the way it *had* been operating up until relatively recently (i.e., low fees and fast and reliable confirmations), by allowing blocks to continue to grow at the relatively gradual pace they've grown at since Bitcoin's inception.";2;0;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dpwo68r;Roger Ver on Twitter: The goal is not that everyone can afford to run a node.

"slvbtc - thanks for your comment, I appreciate your thoughts.

No one here, not even Ver and Jihan are saying anyone should be prohibited from running a node.  This is pure Blockstream propaganda.  Quite to the contrary, Ver has argued that anyone and everyone who wants to run a node can have at it.  If the bandwidth becomes cost prohibitive, Ver has suggested, on many occasions, that groups can run a node on purchased bandwidth and share the cost.  It is conceivable that you have 100's of node clubs wherein everyone chips in a buck a month and the node keeps a watchful eye.

As for Nakamoto's original vision of nodes; it is much closer to Ver/Jihan's vision than Back and/or other core devs/small-blockers.

*""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification 
(section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.*  ***Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.***  *A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.*

*""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  

That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*

*""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""*

"You are taking a technical perspective and completely disregarding economics and behavioural theory.

At the end of the day, miners won't mine a coin with no value. So they can mine whatever they want, but if the majority of non-mining nodes — which actually own, value and transact bitcoin and are an important part of the source of its value — don't follow them they are mining worthless trash data.

Miners need users, users need miners. Neither will act unless they believe the other will follow. Hence broad consensus, or at least the perception of it, is required. Consensus of BOTH non-mining users and miners. Miners DO NOT hold all the chips. Simple game theory.

This does not follow from the fact that the network has 3 nodes. They wouldn't be interested if the price is low. In general it makes more sense to keep the value in a network secured by a lot of miners and 3 non-mining nodes than in a network without hashpower and 100 000 nodes. The network with the hashpower can easily kill the network with the nodes just start doublespending, censoring, etc. Since the 100 000 nodes network will have no hashpower to protect itself attacking it will be cheap. On the other hand the 3 nodes network can function just fine as long as it is protected against DDoS (in practice you probably need a couple of hundred nodes to be protected against ddos but other than that full nodes are useless);1;1;False;Eirenarch;dpwkg7h;Roger Ver on Twitter: The goal is not that everyone can afford to run a node.

When was the last time Bitcoin had a fork 7 blocks deep?

It will take a few days once the chain is really processing transactions; but there certainly will be a market for it. I mean there is a market for Dogecoins.

 Clashic coins were worth more before the fork than BCH coins are right now so I don't see why it wouldn't have at least as much support as Dogecoin. 

Clashic is the real BCH and in time will take over hashrate and marketcap.

BCH was forked without community support; it was pushed through by a few big names but most of us really had no input on the direction of Clashic. I'm just glad that Satoshi was smart enough to create an EDA just so the original chain could be resurrected after a hostile fork.

"But in your example using Bitcoin Core will be a consequence of having economic power not reason for this economic power. The nodes themselves serve no purpose. If someone wants to transact on the chain with 3 nodes he will download a wallet (be it full node or SPV) for that network and do it. Imagine for example that you have a network with 100 000 full nodes run by poor Africans. Not only are these full nodes but they represent real people. On the other hand you have a network with hashpower and 3 nodes but the users are Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos (all on SPV wallets, don't even run nodes) and they want to use the coins on this network. The economic power of the second network is much greater than the economic power of the first network despite having much lower number of nodes and the miners will go to the network with greater economic power.

Also again a network with small amount of hashpower is unsecure it can be destroyed by someone with enough haspower a network without nodes is still secure if it has hashpower.

I agree that raw number of nodes is not a direct proxy for economic majority but if everybody did use Bitcoin Core as their wallet and did most daily transactions with it then it would be close. As it is the weighting is uneven with some nodes being essentially useless and some handling thousands of users via SPV, exchanges etc. The point is that a lot of the non-mining nodes are very important indeed.

"Is Math factual enough for you?

Ok. Lets start at ground zero. Today. 4 transactions per second with 1mb blocks.

Moores law states that to keep the same level of node operation as we have today then the blocksize should double every 2 years (50% per year).

In 14 years from now that gives you 512 transactions per second.

So you are assuming this will be enough, In a decade and a half from now.

If in 14 years from now say you have 1 billion users, thats enough capacity to give every user one transaction every 22.6 days before your blocks clog up. Say you want all 1 billion future users to have 1 transaction per day? Ok, so then start today at 128 transactions per second (around 32mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for 14 years and each of your future users in 14 years time can have 1 transaction per day. 

Maybe you might want each future user to have 10 transactions per day? Ok start TODAY at 1280 transactions per second (lets say 512 mb blocks) and double that every 2 years for the next 14 years.

So, If you want to have 1 billion users in 14 years from now each allowed 10 transactions per day. Then you have to be willing to have 512mb blocks TODAY and double that every 2 years for the next 14 years along with moores law. If you cant have 512mb blocks TODAY then you cant even have 10 transactions per user per day in 14 years from now.

But thats just dreaming. A network that only allows 10 transactions per user per day is useless. In 14 years each user will be streaming money, each smart device will be streaming money, im guessing each user will need atleast the capacity for 1 transaction per minute plus lets say theres an extra 1 billion smart devices as users. So at a MINIMUM, 2 billion users each requiring 1140 transactions per day. Thats 26,388,888 transactions per second (26 million transactions per second).To get to that point following moores law means you need to start TODAY with 206,163 transactions per second (close enough to 64GB blocks).

So, if you cannot handle 64 GIGABYTE blocks TODAY and then continue to double that every 2 years for thw next 14 years, you will never be able to handle anywhere near enough transaction traffic in the future.

If the start is now and the goal is 14 years from now and you try to keep up with this level of growth, im guessing within the next 4 to 6 years your blockchain will be controlled by a conglomorate of a few global miners (most likely government agencies with unlimited resources) who have ALL the power, can censor any transactions they want and alter the protocol in any way they want. And you definitely wont be able to run a node to independently validate your own transaction.

The ONLY way to scale safely is using smart contracts and keeping the blocksize as small as possible for as long as possible.

Its sad that because out of short term frustration you are willing to destroy the long term viability of bitcoin to deliver its promise of independent self-soverign money.

But I think there is also a point to be made that zero-conf *has to* either confirm or get double-spent at some point, while people talking about ""Lightning channels that never close"" are really doing a disservice by altering the fundamental properties of second layers.

">Again your implying payment channels are money substitutes. Which is a flat out blatant lie.

No, I'm arguing that a LN ""payment"" that takes the form of updating the state of an open channel (which obviously occurs off-chain) is an imperfect substitute for a payment that takes the form of an actual, confirmed, on-chain transaction.  How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner  ""quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own breach remedy transaction added to the blockchain within a defined ""dispute period."" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity.

But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math.  Payment channels require on-chain transactions for their creation. Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.";4;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dpwdo74;Roger Ver on Twitter: The goal is not that everyone can afford to run a node.

"This is why I agreed to S2x. Have less congestion while we figure out the real solution right? Hell if we did this right away,  there probably wouldn't even be a Bitcoin Cash. The problem is that eventually 2mb will quickly fill up and we then go to 4mb then that would fill up and go to 8mb and so on. Imagine where we would be at if there was still only one chain? BCH is already at 8mb so I could only imagine  what it would be at if there was still one chain. People will immediately ask for another increase and another until soon we have a bitcoin data centers all over the globe doing the validations for us and accidently turned Bitcoin into Paypal (only there will be corporations working together). This is why they don't do increases because one,  we will keep crying everytime the blocks got full and two,  it would trick us into thinking that big blocks IS the answer to scaling and will be too late once we realize what we have done. 

Number 1 importance is security, stability, and to increase decentralization of the network. Could you imagine if the network was so light, wallets in smart watches in the future could also be nodes securing your transactions? This won't be possible by making it more demanding by increasing block size. We want it to be as small as possible so more places less advanced than ours can too have cheap and secured access to the network. This is key that we protect decentralization as much as possible or we have nothing. Now I'm not saying bitcoin has it perfect yet because it doesn't, but this just adds more to how hard decentralization with massive scaling is to achieve. Since we are not patient,  we stop to consider these things and keep wanting free and instant payments now thinking we know the future.  For all we know,  both BTC and BCH are going I.

"It's always been an odd hole in the small block argument: we don't want to price out small miners (despite the fact that mining is manifestly centralised already for Bitcoin core) and for that (already missed) goal we're willing to let fees increase and hence price out small users. (The argument obviously isn't about small node operators because Bitcoin cash demonstrates that small node operation is perfectly possible on any old broadband connection, so I'll assume Roger was talking about small miners when he says ""run a node"".)

I would actually argue that Roger is partially wrong, ideally we _would_ like everyone to be able to run a node, mining if they wish, but that should be priority two, not ""don't want it"". Priority one is, as he says, that everyone be able to use Bitcoin. That means you can't do 2 at the expense of 1 and you can't do 2 until you've achieved 1. Core have it the wrong way round.

The second big hole in the argument: if block sizes should be limited, what criteria was used to pick 1M? It's coincidental that the perfect number happened to be a nice round number that satoshi had already arbitrarily picked. Reductio ad absurdum disproves their argument of course, if small is good then why not 500k, why not 100k?  Why was 2M so bad that S2X was fought with such vehemence?

No, not really.  Borrowing from a previous comment:

So-called ""layer two solutions"" aren't ""scaling""; they're *banking*.

And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.

"[”As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/spv-as-implemented-today-is-exactly-as-described-in-the-bitcoin-whitepaper-2a65265afbec). While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker’s fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user’s software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification”.

A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.

Because we wouldn't want to set a precedent of... addressing a huge and growing problem in a timely and sensible manner?

"Your so-called validating nodes don't validate the blocks as blocks in the chain (only miners do that; if your ""node"" validates a block and miners ignore it, that block doesn't magically become a valid block in the chain) and aren't nodes of the network (Bitcoin is a *mining* network). 

What Core calls ""nodes"" are technically parasites on the network, though a necessary tool for some businesses. Bitcoin is only as decentralized as its mining. A million ""validating nodes"" and only one miner is far more vulnerable than 10 large-hashpower mining nodes owned by different groups  in different jurisdictions and zero additional ""validating nodes."" Those million ""validating nodes"" are powerless if the miner decides to do doublespends, because *they aren't the real validators*. Miners are. **Mining nodes are the only validating nodes worthy of the name!** 

Core hates the idea that the Bitcoin network is a mining network, because their understanding of economics and incentives is so amateur that they think this opens Bitcoin to abuse by miners. Miners *always* have the *power* to abuse the network (and ""validating nodes"" are of no help against the most damaging attack) but they have every *incentive* not to. Incentives are apparently a subtle concept, but they are what makes Bitcoin work. If you already don't believe the incentive structure works, these comically mislabeled ""validating nodes"" can't save you, and if you do believe the incentive structure works they are mostly pointless for the average person to run and are largely useless for decentralization, the whole point of which is after all to make it unviable to attack Bitcoin.

"Because I can dictate the rules I want blocks of transactions to follow until such time where the system is truly global and I can rely on a global consensus network to pick the rules for me. You can make the argument that users will switch to coins that they agree with, but I'd argue that many users of the US dollar would love to pick another ""dollar"" but the government has so much power of the dollar that it's extremely hard to do so. If we get to a point where miners have too much control over the rules of our money we go back to square one in that a subset of companies control the global money supply, assuming there is one main global cryptocurrency. I do not want a conglomerate to mine my blocks. It's important money is accessible to everyone, this includes low fees. It's important it is censorship resistant, this includes a global network of competing miners and a global network of full nodes. We're not at either yet.

"BCH favors upgradeability over immutability. If you are looking for a coin that preserves immutability you are looking for BTC.

Similarly if you are looking for a coin that has no respect for immutability; there are many coins with more aggressive and radical upgrade roadmaps than BCH.

BCH might have had a chance of success if we didn't have a full Crypto Ecosystem. But the truth is that there are many coins with better privacy, faster transactions, lower fee's, more scalability, etc.

BCH is simply a distraction that will be very costly. 

BTC represents a digital gold store of value which anchors the entire ecosystem. 

BCH is not even trying to compete with BTC as store of value; BCH is competing against all the other altcoins. BCH has no advantage over any altcoins other than Name Recognition. 

Many altcoins have a stronger community, longer development history, more wallets, and just generally more ecosystem penetration than BCH.

If transaction throughput is the reason you are interested in BCH you need to ask yourself why BCH should succeed over the many Alts with already better cash-like properties.

"Here's the original video that got attention. It kind of made Tai's YouTube channel blow up overnight. It was a paid YouTube advertisement that was broadcast on a whole lot of different genres of YT videos - not necessarily financial/wealth/car/lifestyle. I'm NOT advocating the Roger ever do videos in this style or as overblown as Tai. I'm just trying to say that a YouTube channel can blow up with the right personality, a memorable first impression, and a whole lot of advertisement exposure to the right audience. It has 65 million views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1RJTHf5fk

He actually does make videos that are somewhat useful too. This one coincidentally has to do with marketing and adoption: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sQHj91fkG4 - He has a lot of videos, occasional celebrity appearances, occasional lambos.

I'm not saying Roger to do things Tai's way, but Tai did a fantastic job in creating a boom of interest very quickly. Again, I just say this because I have NOT come across cryptocurrency being broadcast in a face-to-face, understandable way to the everyday person on a large scale yet. This deficit goes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litcoin, Monero, and all the other big market cap players as well.

There are a lot of millennials out there who are very dissatisfied with how our financial system works, me included. In my opinion, the right crypto being promoted by the right person can be a fantastic catalyst for adoption.";6;1;False;LoopyBullet;dpx9lki;I just started paying for this Bitcoin Cash radio ad on more than 150 radio stations across the USA.;7ddzmr;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9dUqTMs9O4

BTC is not being run by anyone, definitely not by the banks. If anything BTC is way more decentralized than BCH, more divers development, holders, miners, usage etc. Lies.

You want to defend the guy who currently controls more than 10% of BCH hashpower. This guy who abuses the bitcoin.com domain to get richer himself and spreading misinformation. Who actively brags on the sub he moderates, that he bought radio commercials to confuse noobs to go to his website, use his wallet, buy his mining, read the misinformation and make him richer and control BCH more.

"I'm not sure; but I guess if it's obvious it is spam, and if it lasts for too long, miners will simply temporarily raise the minimum fee; since proportional to most people's usage, spam uses up so many more bytes, most people won't feel the difference, but the spammer will quickly run out of money. But if the transactions are paying a reasonable fee, there is no sense in calling it spam.

I think there were a couple of times where someone tried to spam Bitcoin Cash already, IIRC both times didn't last more than a few blocks and then things went back to normal; and this was before it had crossed above the 1000 dollars threshold.

"How on earth are you interpreting this as a counterargument at all ? Adam Back is just pointing out that Bitcoin's network and monetary system is so good and secure that the market still has some demand for transactions on it even at 100$/tx  (which is probably true). Back's tweet isn't even a politcal or opinionated statement, it's just an objective (albeit estimated) observation of the market for transactions. This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that OP should cite a source if he is claiming ""X said Y"", which is a general rule that goes for **all** serious debate, not just bitcoin. Heresay is completely worthless in trying to tackle politically devisive issues like this and should be left out of discussion. 

Also ""wake up"" ?

How did I lie? You are the liar. The video clearly explains how segwitcoin is no longer a chain of signatures.  A segwitcoin is a chain of hashes related to the signature, its much much different.  The signatures are removed and only serialized into the blockchain in the coinbase transaction with a hash.  No signatures, just a hash related to signatures.  [Dr. Craig Wright also said similar here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76wngm/bitcoincom_bitcoin_cash_is_bitcoin/dohfq35/).  This is only one of the issues with segwit.

No.  You don't.  Decisions in bitcoin are not made by developers, or community members.

This reflects that you've bought the lies being spoonfed to you on the other sub.

In Bitcoin, the miners make the decisions.  That's always how it has been (for good or bad).  I never agreed with it, but those are the rules, despite what Core and the blockstream fanboys over there tell you.  Why do you think they're so afraid of BCH?  Because they know that miners simply have to drop support for core software and that version of BTC is history.   Stop falling for the lies my friend.  You're only getting 30% of the information over there because they've literally banned the other 70% who convey valid facts they dont want you to know about.  Honestly we dont even need to debate this.  You can kick back and watch what I'm saying play out.

That being said, I would have liked the 2MB upgrade. It would have helped the short term. But, at the end of the day, there is a roadmap. It's gotten us this far.

"Thanks for the measured response first of all.

Maybe it's just me being argumentative, but I easily have a problem with the first thing you say, just like OP.  People have this idea that what some nitwit is saying in some reddit sub, is what someone else believes.  I don't agree with that.

I do not believe that the core developers believe BTC should not be currency.  I simply do not.

  As you mentioned BTC has ""has been used as currency for years up until the 1 MB blocks started getting full"".  So it seems they hit a scaling issue.  I'm guessing they are working on it.

The way this sub talks BCH has fixed everything and is here to save the world.  To me it sounds like they've watched one to many Roger Ver videos.

Anyways, good luck to BCH, but I have very little interest in it.  (Well why are you in a bitcoin cash sub? lol don't get me started on that either)

Bitcoin has done nothing but make me money, so to me, it has been nothing but a blessing, and I have loved every minute of it.  ETH even more so.  There are almost 1300 cryptos that do so many different things, I like lots of em.  I'll stay away from BCH personally and I'd say half of the reason is the r/btc reddit community lol.

"The argument has changed many times, but yes that's a currently popular, although a very a weak one.

1) We didn't have DoS attacks when blocks weren't full. Now, when blocks are full Bitcoin seems to be under ""attack"" all the time. (If you read r/bitcoin and Core devs tweets you'll see they are convinced of this)

Smaller/fuller blocks are easier and cheaper to fill. Fewer tx and less total fees are needed for increasing the fee level for other users, than it would for bigger blocks. (in other words to deny them of service)

2) Full blocks increase centralization.

Number of nodes grows with the economy and larger network is less centralized than a smaller one. If you can't do business with Bitcoin why would you run a node? If commercial activity is kicked off-chain, one can't simply expect speculators and holders run nodes as a hobby.

3) High fees increase centralization. 

When the main chain is so expensive to use (due to high fees) that it prices out significant portion (now probably 95%) of the world population.


And for the last, fun fact:

Currently mempool in Bitcoin is so big that Core clients running on Raspberry Pis crash due to running out of memory (mempool is stored in RAM). Bitcoin cash runs just fine on Raspberry Pi. So there goes even the Raspberry Pi argument. (although I think one should run 24/7 nodes on good server grade hardware for best reliability)";2;0;False;uxgpf;dpw7t82;BitPay and Coinbase: Core has declared BTC only a store of value.

Also Bitcoin and crypto space as whole has attracted lot of these get-rich-quick types lately, who are not interested about actual usage. They are happy to use legacy banking and are only in this for quick buck.

"This. This is exactly why I do not believe the fear that was thrown around early by the Core team saying that a Fork is dangerous. This, along with the fact that they waited two years before allowing the scale, while those that wanted the blocksize increase had to explain to potential newbies, ""yeah, it used to be faster and cost less, but we're working on it."" These excuses were totally unnecessary when we could have just bumped the size, avoided a fork, and allowed people all over the world to access and experience an inexpensive coin.

"You're not going to like the answer.  I see BCH as a knockoff of BTC.  I see BCH as a real possibility just like litecoin.  Whatever.  There will always be more than one crypto and they will all have different niches or roles in the cryptoworld.  I also believe most cryptos might as well be dodge 3 years from now.

"Bitcoin Cash isn't an altcoin, it's a fork. Many of us believe that it's BTC that has changed, not Bitcoin Cash. The man who Satoshi left the Bitcoin project to, Gavin Andresen, said that Bitcoin Cash is the real continuation of the Bitcoin Project, not BTC. [link](https://bitsonline.com/gavin-andresen-endorses-bitcoin-cash/). If BCH gets the most proof of work, it technically becomes Bitcoin (like the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic fork). All the mining hardware and infrastructure is there, the name brand is there, the familiarity , etc. Also, everyone who held Bitcoin on August 1st, 2017 received equal numbers of the forked coin, so nobody will lose any coins who bought before then and didn't sell.

Good post.  BTC has become a twisted shadow of its former self.  It’s quite sick to see.  I’m cautiosly optimistic the market will figure this out.  I hope.

Hard forking upgrades are no problem, you're right about block times being slower than alternatives like ethereum though. Anonymity doesn't matter for a payment processor like bitpay, in fact a public ledger would actually help. I like Monero, but its fees are high, and imo is better suited as a privacy specific coin instead of a general use to buy your usb chargers online type coin.

">if it wants blocks bigger than 8 MB it needs to hard fork

Are you living under a rock? I'm pretty sure we can handle hard forks.

>It's not anonymous

Bitcoin was never meant to be.

> it has 10 minute confirmation times making it sluggish and slow to transact onchain

It removed RBF, so zero-conf works great for smaller transactions.

>Monero... already solved the block size issue by having implemented al algorithm that dynamicly expands and contracts block size depending on damand

Bitcoin Cash can scale to virtually limitless with on-chain transactions.

"You know I know the basics, I am aware of how to send and receive btc, I know how to set my own fees, I know how to check the blockchain manually and see the actual fee I need to send a tx. As I've been saying I have taken the biggest part of my pay ( 85 to 90% of it) in Bitcoin for over two years now.


 Im not an investor of any sorts I am just a person who works online and discovered Bitcoin because my employers offered to pay me a little bonus every week if I took my pay in Bitcoin rather than paypal, direct deposit, check, etc. I never used Bitcoin because of any other reason than it was a very efficient and effective way of collecting my pay. 


I have learned how to buy most everything I need with Bitcoin as well as how to convert it to cash if need be. This was fine and worked very well for me up until a few months ago. Once the price started raising really high something changed. I'm not sure if it was just increased traffic due to publicity or what but everyone knows how much different it has been using BTC the past few months than it was two years ago. 


All I'm trying to say is that personally I can't afford to use it like I did use it any longer. The cost of fees started adding up so much that I was noticably loosing money every week. Now it is much cheaper and faster for me to use any other available method to take my pay in. 


It bothers me when I hear folks preaching about how BTC is going to take over and replace Fiat and all that type of talk. You have to look at this from my point of view for one minute. I am not trying to run BTC down, I'm simply stating absolutely true experiences that I have encountered during the past few months.



 Something that I used as my bank, my wallet, and my debit card for over two years has changed so drastically that I can not afford to use it now. It is very aggravating for me that I had to go back to using direct deposit. But it is even more aggravating for me to come on some forums and see people that attack folks because they are listing very real problems with this currency. 




I mean look at how irate certain people get when the extremely high fees are mentioned. It is horrible imo that certain folks now act as if Bitcoin should only be used as an investment by the rich instead of a currency .we all know the fees are high but some folks can't even allow themselves to see that. 


Anyone who trys to claim they have not experienced these problems in the past couple months has not been actually using Bitcoin. There's just no way someone could have used BTC at the same frequency that I do (well I used to) can say they haven't either had to pay very high fees or else wait on stuck TXs more times than not over the past few months.



  I just found this sub Reddit tonight. I am very happy that I did because it seems like you folks see the same problems I see and are interested in fixing them. I want to point out that when I refer to people ignoring the problems and saying high fees are fine that I am referring to the other Reddit Bitcoin sub and not this one.";6;2;False;nd130903;dpwb4wd;BitPay and Coinbase: Core has declared BTC only a store of value.

Guys. That's great you want things. But if everyone switched over to BCH you'd just have the same problem. Only the can is kicked down the road a bit at the expense of decentralization. If you want global digital cash that is also secure and decentralized, you have to do it with second layers. Or use something like IOTA that scales and has 0 fees. Bitcoin cash is not the solution to global cash.. it's the same shit as bitcoin only shittier. Also, fuck the whitepaper. It's outdated because obviously the technical limitations of blockchain prevent global digital cash from happening. So, accept Bitcoin's limitations and figure out how to make it better. Or, move on to IOTA which happens to be a better fit for satoshi's vision than both  BTC or BCH. I hold both because store of value is important and 0 fees beat low fees every single time.;4;1;False;DanDarden;dpw59n4;BitPay and Coinbase: Core has declared BTC only a store of value.

Still, maybe you guys should have already done that half a year ago. I mean, what BitPay does is actually not rocket science. Receiving coins and then selling them. The most complex part is for sure the integration with traditional banks.

BitPay demonstrates there is a huge demand for that, because otherwise they would have been bankrupt since long.

"Not true.

Decentraliztion comes only from mining nodes. Allowing some tens of millions of new users like Bitcoin cash does compaed to core allowed many many new mining nodes as well as tens of thousands of new potential non-mining nodes (which don't contribute to network security or decntraliztion).

However not allowing new users (core) is sure to not bring new nodes.

where is *your* data to say it can't?

"I might try to put together some actual numbers. But basically the way I understand the centralization argument is that as the block size increases many existing nodes will not be able to keep up, causing the number of nodes in the network to reduce, which will allow a smaller group to gain majority control of the node network, which can lead to possible manipulation. 

I agree this can happen if the block size goes up too fast. But if it goes up in direct proportion to adoption, which it will, then as adoption increases more businesses will put more powerful nodes in the network to protect their interests. So killing off the slow nodes isn't really a problem.

This Litecoin schtick cracks me up. How many potential overstock.com or newegg.com customers hold LTC? How many hold BCH? Since most BCH has never moved, the number of people who already hold significant amounts of BCH that could he used for purchases is on the order of the number who hold BTC, which is obviously several orders of magnitude higher than those who hold LTC. So no, Litecoin and other alts do not come close. The network effect of the ledger is no joke.;5;2;False;ForkiusMaximus;dpw4beh;BitPay and Coinbase: Core has declared BTC only a store of value.

Why did you switch and get tricked into segshit? Something that is not in the whitepaper.  As [Peter Rizun explains a segwitcoin is not a Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY) it has a different security model by removing the signatures from the blockchain and only referring to signatures through a hash. Segwitcoin is no longer a chain of signatures. Its a vastly weaker security model.  Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin, enjoy your alt-coin and the [$1000 fees as advocated by segwit supporters](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).;6;1;False;cryptorebel;dpw2v0m;BitPay and Coinbase: Core has declared BTC only a store of value.
