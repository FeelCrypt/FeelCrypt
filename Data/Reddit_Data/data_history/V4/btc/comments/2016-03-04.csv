At 1800BTC mined per day post-halving that would be about $18 per day. I can cover the electrical costs and make a profit off that if the difficulty goes low enough. Even if the hashrate drops to almost zero it would mean I can hard fork the network myself to reset it back to a difficulty of 1 and carry on mining. This would not be profitable if the price dropped to a half-penny or less.;0;1;False;Bitcoinopoly;d0nx4v2;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp

Miners who already have hardware will still mine if they earn more than only their cost of electricity. In the midterm after halving you would see a slow decline if the price dips because miners will invest less in new hardware. So in such a case we could see a slow decline in hash rates but I don't think it would be as drastic as 50% or even more. ;1;1;False;kikkerdril;d0nwkrr;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp

The effect of the last halving on price was not perceptible.  For 5 weeks after the halving (on 2012-11-28) the price remained stuck at ~13 USD/BTC.  Then there started a rally that, judging from [the relative prices across exchanges](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/realwork/EXPORT/projects/bitcoin/relative-prices/out/2015-02-20-ccf-01d-sm07-2012-11-20--2014-03-10.png), was pulled by BTC-China (Shanghai), that had just been bought by Bobby Lee; and therefore must have been due to the opening of the Chinese market.  Likewise, the bigger rally that started in Sep/2013 came in the heels of the opening of Huobi and OKCoin in Beijing.

"There is a way for you to go nuclear, Mr Armstrong - add some alts to your exchange (eth, dash, doge and ltc).

One reason the miners are being intransigent is because they think alts haven't got network advantages, and therefore no one will migrate from btc. But all that changes if alts are added to coinbase which has the most retail users.

You'll be hedging your bets too. If people choose to migrate in MySpace=>Facebook fashion, at least they'll be doing it on your platform and you'll survive regardless.

"Western schooling is partly to blame for this. 

The first two of Brian's concerns come partly from the fact that there in western shooting, there is a culture in that the road to success is ""getting the right answer"". It emphasises high grades in standardised tests over tangible results in real products and it emphasises individual performance over communication and collaboration. I know this is a problem for developers because it affected me when I was younger. (Maybe it still does, but I'm very conscious of it now.) But Bitcoin Core seems *really* badly afflicted by ""please sir, I know the answer"". On the other end of the scale is Gavin Andresen. You can easily and unfairly pick fault with his work for being imperfect, but he has consistently and tirelessly (I have no idea how he isn't physically exhausted from wading through the Corestream tarpit) worked to make Bitcoin more useful, more capable of fulfilling its goal.

Part of the problem is that having spend 10-20 years in formal education being told ""Yes Billy, that's the right answer!"", it's very hard to accept that social skills you have gained for this are not beneficial in a work environment and that your love of perfecting things in isolation does not create viable software on its own. I try to stay conscious of this personally at all times, but it's something even more important to be aware of if you're influencing a world-changing $6bn financial experiment.

I find it helpful whenever I get stuck thinking ""how can I solve this problem perfectly"" to stop and ask ""why are we solving this problem at all?"". Then it becomes a lot clearer how much is worth investing in honing it before something else becomes more worthwhile to improve instead.";8;2;False;ashmoran;d0nx3ra;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp

"That was a genuine pleasure to read. A complex topic explained well.

I will say this however, I have given up. I think the partisanship that shitblock-core has built is too severe to overcome. With skin in the game, I watched this unfold since early 2011. No more. Enough is enough. BS-core has broke my camels back.

The risk that the whole house comes crashing down on Bitcoin is significant. Maybe it'll recover, or maybe it somehow dance on the knifes edge and narrowly avoid disaster, or muddle its way trough. Whatever the case, it's too large to be ignored. And if nothing else, Bitcoin will serve as an abject lesson to all other cryptocurrencies.";29;2;False;pyalot;d0ntwzg;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp
"No doubt it is a select few of the miners rather than the Core developers who are a major roadblock to any immediate increase in the maximum block size.  In addition, the Core developers (at least one or two of them) are now shouting the proverbial “the sky is falling” with the upcoming block reward halving and the potential for an up to 50 percent reduction in hashing power.  The real crisis is the Bitcoin governance structure which has been mentioned time and time again on this subreddit. What is the solution? As Brian alluded to it’s hashing power and full node versions.  The former is really up to the miners.  I believe only market forces will make them switch to BIP 109 at this point. In that respect, a continued bitcoin price decline is the best motivator since miners are the group most sensitive to declining prices.  All the rest of us can do (unless you’re a whale who can afford to short bitcoin) is run BIP 109 compatible full nodes, which is our way of telling both the miners and the Core developer we want a 2-MB max block size!  Ridiculing the Core developers, and to some extent, the holdout miners may only makes them further entrenched in their position and is unproductive. Less talk and more action is what we need to maintain Bitcoin's integrity now.
