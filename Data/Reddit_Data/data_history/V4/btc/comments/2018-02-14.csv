"What I'd suggest you do is give the device an activation code that will only allow it to work once it's been registered on your site with a pre-defined cryptographic key that will need to be re-registered every time it's plugged in to a new device. 

This will also give you an opportunity to display on the activation webpage at the time specific details of current known hacks. ""Did your device come with a scratch card seed? It's fraudulent"". ""This device has been previously registered. If you have not registered before please follow these steps to reset your device"". 

That will prevent these low-tech attacks as well as creating a channel to communicate with new users who may have bought from a 3rd party seller, showing them how to properly reset the device before continuing.

Bitpays big contribution wasn't letting merchants accept crypto, it was letting merchants accept crypto but get PAID in fiat. Coinbase's new platform is very welcome, but doesn't do that.

why does cheapair's coinbase merchant portal still say BTC only?  Is this coinbase commerce simply a wallet for merchants seperate from coinbase's merchant payment portal, or is coinbase choosing to roll this out to one merchant at a time?;5;1;False;thetimpotter;du9b3i6;Coinbase Commerce officially launched today, with full BCH support;7xklel;https://medium.com/@coinbasecommerce/coinbase-commerce-the-easiest-way-for-merchants-to-accept-digital-currency-54ba64966f8d

"Very positive development!

Just tried this out. Straightforward and easy to set up. You are given a backup phrase to recover your funds. It doesn't appear there are any fees to use this service, but this is most likely because there is no crypto to fiat conversion option yet.
