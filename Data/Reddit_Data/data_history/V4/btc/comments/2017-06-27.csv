"So then it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.

1) bigger blocks don't mean less nodes. In fact small blocks like right now ensure no new nodes, therefore static blocks mean no growth. While adding tens of millions of users will bring not only people and business who want to run nodes, but they will be able like they are not today.

2). centralization comes from the bank controlling the ledger, therefore decentralized means to split up this power. Therefore non mining nodes don't matter for decentralizations, THis is a manipulation tactic and you've fallen fully for it.

"**Root name server**

A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.

A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses.

"Define your terms. I'm going to do that then you can either dispute my definitions or my argument that on-chain scaling is compatible with the terms as defined.

- Security: Irreversibility of payments. The relative irreversibility of payments, in the long run, is proportional to total miner fees. On chain scaling can achieve higher total fees than moving payments off-chain.
- Decentralization (part 1): Number of actors that must cooperate to 51% attack the network. Centralization mostly driven by economies of scale in ASIC manufacturing and mining farm operation. Headers-first mining (ugly as it is) negates the block-size driven advantage that miners with good internet have over miners with worse internet.
- Decentralization (part 2): Cost of knowing the transaction paying you, and the block it's included in, are valid and therefore unlikely to be orphaned. SPV + Fraud proofs can solve this handily. If you feel that's too handwavy I'll have to write a proper explanation of how to do this.
- Cheap AF: < $0.05 fees. We've definitely had that fee range in the past, when block sizes weren't constrained.

"> You can talk to anyone on the internet, and your messages run all over the world without a single entity routing your traffic. Instead, that task is performed by a network of smaller routers, switches, bridges, and/or hubs.

Amazing how cypherpunks think that the internet is a natural resource like air or sunlight, above and beyond the reach of governments.

Sorry to disappoint you, but the internet is run by a handful of big telecom companies, that have no desire to stand up against local governments to protect the privacy or some other rights that some users may think they should have.  The internet is in fact highly centralized -- not physically, but administratively.  

> What would be the problem of a company running a lightning network system with a bunch of routers keeping track of pathing.

It will lose the two supposedly great advantages of bitcoin: anonymity and resistance to blocking.  The hub company will know exactly how much you paid to whom, and can block your payments for any reason it cares.  Moreover it can charge you the fees that it wants.

> Running a lightning network does not require vast amounts of users. What if you want to set up your own network with family, some friends, your employer, your dog?

Because the money you lock up in that family network will be good only for paying the users of that network.   How often do you need to make a non-refundable payment to your sister-in-law, that you cannot trust a bank to carry it?

Moreover, the LN only works if it serves a population that is mostly economically closed -- that is, almost all the money that each user received through the LN will be spent through the LN.  If your employer pays you through the LN, but your landlord, supermarket, gas station, and dentist all want dollars or on-chain bitcoins, then the channel from your employer to you will be exhausted after the first salary.  It means that he will do two on-chain transactions for each payment to you, instead of just one (if he did not use the LN) or zero (if he did not use bitcoin at all).

"> Busy but available

You misunderstand. This is an oxymoron. Busy funds are temporarily unavailable for spending, while they are being used to negotiate another transaction. You can't spend them because they are required to settle someone else's transaction first - if you did, their transaction would fail. Conversely, if someone spent their funds while your transaction was using them to negotiate a payment, your payment would fail.

> airport

Air traffic IS a hub-and-spoke model. Major airports service each other and minor airports. You cannot avoid any hub you like, anyone familiar with air travel (or know people that frequently do!) will tell you that it's either transfer at the airport you don't want to be at, or miss your appointment. For example, I live somewhere that is serviced by a large international airport and a small local airport. It is impossible for me to get from here to many destinations by air, without passing through either my local international airport, or one of only two other international airports that are within range of the small one. Since most of the major flights that pass through here come from one of those other two airports, it's practically impossible for me to avoid that airport when flying.

There are hundreds and hundreds of international airports out there, but the fact is I must use one of only three if I wish to fly, and I am forced to use my local international airport and another undesirable airport if I wish to fly in a timely fashion. Sure, there _could_ be more flights here, and I _could theoretically_ avoid an undesirable airport, but I don't _actually_ have the option.

LN is practically begging for the analogy equivalent of a winter snowstorm. Exchanges mitigate DDoS as well as they can and have failsafes in place to protect user funds. Their performance is based on their ability. Meanwhile, LN has a failsafe ... that ties up your funds for longer, performs based on participation (which means lack of participation due to unforseen circumstance is a risk surface), and even has a resolution path that ends in _loss of funds_.

As Craig Wright states:

“There are around 15000 banks. Add financial organisations including savings and loans... We are up to 60,000. Then add in all the major merchants and operations that need to have transaction data by law, and that’s around 17 million organisations. That is decentralised do you not think?”

"> The problem with that counterargument is that's a very specific behaviour we're privileging, and while it does give you shorter paths than ""pick at random in advance"", it gives you longer paths than ""make at least one of your connections to the most central node in the graph"" 

That is a theoretical problem, yes.  Then there is the practical problem that opening a new channel entails two on-chain transactions (open and eventually close) hence two fees and two delays of 10 minutes (expected) or more.  And the user must commit **new** bitcoins to that channel: he cannot use any of the bitcoins that he has already locked in his other channels.

Moreover, I believe that, with such a ""solution"", the number of channels per user will end up being substantially larger than what would be enough for a tree of height X.  Even if the payments that each user wishes to make were highly skewed towards a small set of habitual trading peers.

> very obvious that what's actually needed is a simulation

Since the LN idea came out, I have been asking the authors to provide a hypothetical future scenario -- with 10 million users and other parameters like topology, number of ""merchants"", number of channels per consumer and per ""merchant"", distribution of payments, etc. -- so that we could run such simulations.   They never answered.  In fact, every conversation with them ended in silence whenever I asked that.  I can imagine why: any scenario that I can think of is obviously shown to be not viable, by calculations that one can do in one's head.

Perhaps it would be better to restate the question as ""What is the maximum number of people I can reach in n hops or less with x connections?"" In your example, the Bob-Charlie link is a wasted link from Alice's perspective. If it didn't exist, Alice would still be able to send money to Bob and Charlie in one hop. Likewise, if we replace that replaced that link with a Bob-David connection, Alice would be able to reach one more person in 2 hops than she would with the cycle. 

If it helps, you can re-frame the argument by saying that the tree is a BFS tree of the lightning network of the shortest paths from Alice to everyone else.

"> For things like micro-payments (low value, low risk tranasctions), I fail to see why off-chain solutions like changetip was are not a suitable solution.

There you have your answer.  Changetip was centralized, hence it was much faster and cheaper than any decentralized solution can be.  Yet it folded because it was financially unsustainable: the cost of executing those small transactions was not covered by the value (hence the fees) that the service provided.

Moreover, the $0.05 to $1.00 payments that ChangeTip carried are not exactly what micropayments is usually assumed to mean.  The term usually means paying fractions of a cent, mostly automatically, for atomic activities like doing a Google search, sending a tweet or email, issuing a data packet, or fetching a webpage.  

**Unidirectional payment channels** between user and provider of the service could carry such small payments at fairly low cost.  I suppose that, for each micropayment, one message from consumer to service would suffice: namely the consumer would have to send a new signed transaction to the provider through some channel, and the provider would have to receive and validate it.  (But I am not sure; maybe two or more messages may be needed for each micropayment.)

However, an on-chain transaction, with attendant locked-up bitcoins, tx fees, and delay, would be needed to set up the channel.  Moreover, the first payment would have to include the fee to close the channel at the end. So that method would be worth only if one expects to make  extensive use of that service.  In which case a pay per hour or per month scheme would be much better in all respects.

The **Lightning network** would remove the need to create a channel to every new service provider, but would make each micropayment much more cumbersome and expensive.

This does not, in any way, preclude Bitcoin from functioning as designed.

Absolutely not. Two of the primary and most important affordances are lost: sole control of funds and trustless participation. There is also a third, as I will explain.

> while also giving users a fundamentally more efficient, secure, and better designed layer 2 system - especially in the long term.

More efficient? Not by monetary standards, your spending power in a Lightning network is diminished by its use during negotiation of channel hops. Secure? Rather the opposite - dependency on a countersignature is the inverse of personal security. Better designed? That's a flat joke - it's design is a mirror of legacy settlement networks.

> but developing the game theory mechanics in such a manner to include a weighting representing the beneficial behaviour of those within the network to ensure bitcoin is protected from those nefarious agents outside of the network, is actually very clever.

Clever or no, it introduces a risk surface for participants that doesn't exist under Bitcoin's security model. Weighting doesn't solve the problem. It's fairly trivial to craft hostile activity in a manner that appears legitimate. Bitcoin has an incentive structure that is designed so that the consequences of hostile behavior are immediately damaging to the bad actor. The argument that ""people have a vested interest in making it work"" isn't enough. There needs to be immediate consequences for hostile activity that doesn't require intervention on the part of the victim, otherwise the network cannot remain peer-to-peer nor resistant to influence.

"Kudos for being open to an argument! As a big blocker who's only somewhat concerned with centralization (and mostly in mining, but I think that's unrelated to blocksize to a high degree), I am actually not concerned with having a centralized LN network with just a couple hubs and many spokes as the outcome, *if it sits on top of a capable Bitcoin*.

You must be new to bitcoin.

They admitted back in 2014 already that pegged sidechains, their original idea for the layer 2 network, would not work.  

Liquid is not meant to be a layer-2 solution; it is a commercial product that they sell to exchanges, and is supposed to let them move bitcoins quickly among themselves to give them the edge on arbitrage.

"> What makes Bitcoin work is its financial incentive system which helps keep miners honest.

In essence, this is true - especially as regards the distributed consensus. But, this is because you cannot measure the miners' desire to have a monetary system divorced from state (which may be large given their geographic location). 

They may forgo the opportunity cost of switching resources to other ventures, as they believe in bitcoins anti-establishment principles.

If that is what you think the solution is, then go for it. I for one, would be sad for bitcoin if that happens.

"> Perhaps it would be better to restate the question as ""What is the maximum number of people I can reach in n hops or less with x connections?""


As I understand it, the answer to this question is as follows:

1 + x  + x(x-1) + ...  + x(x-1)^n

This is a hard upper bound, given a maximum node degree of x for the entire graph and a hop limit of n.   This bound can be achieved by a tree topology rooted on the source node.  Such a topology will not provide the required capability for arbitrary source nodes, as it has to be engineered for the benefit of a specific node.  However, if one is prepared to double the hop limit then arbitrary nodes can connect to arbitrary nodes.  (There are a range of tradeoffs between x and n for a given size network. Two extremes involve a cyclic graph where every node is of degree 2 or less and the hops is half the number of nodes and a fully connected graph, where hops is 1 and each node is of degree one less than the number of nodes.)

Bidirectional payment channels also exist and can be used, but they do not quite work, because they are not secure: one of the parties can cancel payments that he made to the other by sending ""stale checks"" to the miners.  To prevent such fraud, one or both parties must watch the blockchain continuously and react promptly when they see an attempt at such fraud.  This is impractical.
Moreover, bidirectional channels are more complicated to use than unidirectional ones. They only would make sense in the context of the LN.

"> Bitcoin has never required exchanges to function

Bitcoin always needed a way to transfer value from fiat to bitcoin to be a currency. While this would have been possible without exchanges, it would have been very very difficult to do in mass scale without. Without a transfer of value from fiat to bitcoin, bitcoin was nothing more than a distributed consensus network. 

> It existed before exchanges came to be, and it can exist in a world where exchanges have ceased to be. 

This is very optimistic, unless you envision a point at which crypto does not transfer value between fiat currency. Is this the case? 

If it is not the case, then exchanges will always exist. Even if exchanges become decentralised through peer 2 peer systems of fiat to crypto exchange, you will still get centralisation within those systems - as some 'exchangers' will hoover up most of the business - similar to how you see top sellers on localbitcoins.

This is completely not true. It will be implemented on top of, and extracting nearly all of the affordances of the layer 1 (certainly some of the most important ones) protocol, while also giving users a fundamentally more efficient, secure, and better designed layer 2 system - especially in the long term.

This may be true - but developing the game theory mechanics in such a manner to include a weighting representing the beneficial behaviour of those within the network to ensure bitcoin is protected from those nefarious agents outside of the network, is actually very clever. i.e those within LN may act more empathetically, if they believe that their actions will ensure the system remains a) peer to peer, and b) resistant to outside state influence/attack.

I am very confident, that it is impossible to build another layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, that allows for transactions with the same properties as the current Bitcoin transactions. You will always make tradeoffs, let it be security or fungibility or something else. If you were able to build a 2nd layer on top of bitcoin which was ""just bitcoin transactions"" (as core devs like to talk about LN), just cheaper, why would anybody use layer 1?

I'm still wondering, how LN routing is supposed to scale. The current LN proposal scales much worse than Bitcoin and it is also more insecure and complicated. All it does, it makes working with Bitcoin worse.


Of course there is a case for micro(!)transactions do be done offchain.

This is completely false. 

The author drew the topology diagram about three paragraphs before he drew the three structure on which his maths is based, so why didn't he do the maths on that previous topological structure? Because either he can't, or he would find the results do not fit his narrative. It's as plain as day. 

If an efficient algorithm for finding the best route through the network is found, and as long as there are trustworthy larger hubs (exchanges, franchises, e-commerce vendors, etc - agents we ALL trust anyway), LN will work out very well for bitcoin.

"It's a shame you're being downvoted for pointing this out. LAtely it seems this sub is on a quest to prove the highest purity to the cause.

We all hate SegWit. We hate its shitty hackiness, its technical debt, and the fact that it was being pushed by an org wh owanted to benefit from a strangled blocksize. But it's not the end of the effin world, especially if finally there is consensus on a HF. This indeed will open the doors to higher blocksizes, hopefully to the point where this debate won't happen again; and blockstream's aim to restrict on-chain scaling for the sake of their business is foiled in the process.There's no need for a lightning network if transactions become reliable and cost a few cents again.

This opens the door to other HFs as well, and the community will remember all the times the Core Devs yelled bloody murder about the possibility of a HF. The Core Devs will be out with this upgrade, even if some of their code ends up being activated. Yes, we'll have to deal with a slightly brainwashed community and a few corrupt miners, but the momentum will no longer be the status quo. From here on out, we will be able to fix the damned transaction format, and while today it seems a bit impossible, I have no doubt somebody can come up with a way to extricate SegWit from the codebase without risking effin-up the anyone-can-spend transactions (and honestly, it's probably as easy as deprecating SW txns for a while, and once the blockchain has buried them to the point where rolling it back to get at those transactions would be tremendously nonsensical, we'll be cool).

A compromise of any kind has historically always irked the extremists at either side, so let's not be extremists. This is not some cunning trick by blockstream to get SW activated (and if it is, they're just really stupid about it, because it won't lead to their desired outcome), this was the only possible way that we would achieve a majority miner support for a HF, let alone a supermajority. Let's celebrate this, at half mast if you so desire, but we **are definitely moving forward**.

"> Still a ""centralized"" hub can't steal your bitcoin from you.

Are we sure of that? If a centralized LN hub was to be closed, or raided, or pull a Pirateat40 or gox, you can end up in a bank-run situation where everybody has to close their channels simultaneously before timelocks expire on thief transactions. 

Blockstream/Core's vision for how Bitcoin will pay for PoW is a fee market with constant mempool backlog^^[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ut05w/why_im_against_bu/ddxr8ks/) and a hard limit to make miners choose few-high‐fee-transactions instead of many-low‐fee-transactions. Think what happens to a time-critical breach remedy transaction when the blockspace is fixed, already backlogged, and everybody else must also get theirs confirmed in time. 

To make it worse, fees will spike from increased demand but the breach remedy transactions still only pay out the same fee, so to get them confirmed everybody has to raise that fee... by throwing more transactions into the traffic jam (CPFP).

> Decentralized with centralized hubs was always how it was proposed. 

This makes its hubs a target for regulation, and censorable.

He also takes numbers very arbitrarily, like saying there could be 20 hops...there are 7,000,00, 000 people in the world and it is estimated there are only 6 hops, ( on bitfury simulation they usually imply something between 3 to 5 hops ).

"It is a valid assumption to make **for the proof**.   

**For the same number of channels per user**, the  number of hops will be lower in a tree structure than in any other topology.  

In a tree structure, if each user has 11 channels (one ""up"" and 10 ""down"") and there are 10 million users, there will be about 9 million users in the fringe, and it will take about 7 hops to reach them from the root.  

If instead each user has channels to 11 **random**  users, it will take **more** than 7 hops to reach most users from any given user X.  That's because if you take all shortest paths from X to other users, they will form a tree with **less** than 11 channels per node, since many channels will  point sideways or backwards and will not help reaching anyone from X.  Then, in that tree, the average path length will be **greater** than the 7 hops of the hypothetical tree above.";4;1;False;jstolfi;djgweai;Game Over Blockstream: Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution (by Jonald Fyookball);6jqrub;https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800
"That assumption, as far as I can tell, decreases the amount of channels required.

It says that for every hop in the tree starting from node X and trying to find node Y, no hop from the tree connects to nodes already in the tree (which would be redundant and useless, since they'd only add a longer path than an existing one). If you don't make that simplifying assumption, as your tree (or rather, in this case, your graph) starts containing a non-trivial percentage of the network (which is the goal), then the effectiveness of an additional random channel or hop is decreased proportionally.

There is an issue with the argument but it has more to do with the idea that each user will open *n* channels randomly all at once and only then decide to try and route payments to others.

If instead you assume that a node opens a new channel whenever it cannot find a path to the recipient in less than X hops, until it reaches a maximum of *n* open channels, then the resulting graph will tend to have a much shorter expected/maximum path length

The problem with *that* counterargument is that's a very specific behaviour we're privileging, and while it does give you shorter paths than ""pick at random in advance"", it gives you longer paths than ""make at least one of your connections to the most central node in the graph"" once the number of distinct nodes you pay > number of channels you open, *especially* if everyone else follows that rule. The moment you introduce smartness in the selection process, you're likely to favour centralization.

This probabilistic analysis is a good starting point, but it makes it very obvious that what's actually needed is a simulation, due to the sheer complexity of the interactions between user strategies and hub strategies.";6;1;False;christophe_biocca;djgpz1q;Game Over Blockstream: Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution (by Jonald Fyookball);6jqrub;https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

"Segwit and Segwit2x - make no mistake its the same thing! Its been shoved down your throats and most of you have come to accept it. If you want a global currency revolution, you go with On-Chain scaling.

Segwit's main argument was that it would enable LN - there you have it. Proof of what many of us have long suspected.

Blockstream, and Barry Silbert have always known that LN was never ready. So why the tremendous push for Segwit???

Wanna know why'? Side-chains. Blockstream was funded on the condition they implement segwit to enable side-chains. This provides the key holders with the ability to create endless side-chains, and scaling through less secure chains, as well as diluting the scarcity of Bitcoin at the same time.

OKay, AXA funds Blockstream. Do you know who funds Barry Silbert's company? Mastercard. Yes, google it all you want.

Everyone here needs to wake up and realise that the Segwit is move by capitalist organisations to maintain their grip on the finance society.

If you are one of those people that has been compromised by the Segwit2x ""compromise"", just ask yourself why are you even agreeing to this? Core never committed themselves to a Blocksize increase, and everyone is suddenly ok with comitting to Segwit - in any form?

While DASH are happy to increase their blocksize, and Monero are happy to organically grow their blocksize, Bitcoin is to remain at a shitty 1MB cap just because certain powers say so?

The sooner we fork the better. Even if we have a minority chain - I believe the economic structure of Bitcoin's incentives will serve us right. Even if Segwit Bitcoin activates and has the initial market cap over Legacy Bitcoin, in no time at all, people will realise that they are waiting hours for confirmations, and paying big fees, when they can just use Legacy Bitcoin and do near instant transactions for near zero cost.

"Which is why the advice from everyone on both subs is always: *keep your coins in a wallet you control the private key of*, not on exchanges. But that does not remove the fact that exchanges play a vital role in the bitcoin ecosystem and that users will still want to make use of their services.

"The internet is rather decentralized, would you not say? You can talk to anyone on the internet, and your messages run all over the world without a single entity routing your traffic. Instead, that task is performed by a network of smaller routers, switches, bridges, and/or hubs.

LN is similar in that regard. It won't be a network of peers all interconnected without hubs or routers. What would be the problem of a company running a lightning network system with a bunch of routers keeping track of pathing.

That system will be just as trustworthy as an exchange. It is not a system suitable for all transactions; large sums of bitcoins can still be transported via the blockchain, and those who prefer to remain anonymous can choose to not use LN and opt for different solutions.

Another point is that running a lightning network does not require vast amounts of users. What if you want to set up your own network with family, some friends, your employer, your dog? Not a problem, as the routing problem does not exist there.

"Lightning is really good for companies like Coinbase and exchanges like Poloniex and Bitfinex. It allows them to use the LN to settle transactions between themselves when users send money between their exchanges. Basically, it's a cheap inter-bank settlement system. 99% of normal users wouldn't have much use for it, as people typically don't need to send money repeatedly to the same address over time. They want to send it to different addresses and users in the economy. LN is best for high-volume transactions between small numbers of centralized parties, which even in an decentralized economic system, do need to be established. 

Don't get me wrong, I agree with you too. I think it would be useful to them and I don't mind it being implemented. But exactly, it isn't the scaling savior. Optimizing block propagation to lower orphan rates is how bitcoin scales. Doing that raises the average size a block can be without getting orphaned; which is a natural market for limiting the blocksize. There should still be some protections in place (I particularly like the idea of a rolling average blocksize cap), but overall the natural market forces can limit the blocksize without needing a supply ceiling (the 1mb cap) which causes economic deadweight loss.

">My guess is that Holders, not Traders and Users, are those who find PoS appealing.

Sure, holders would benefit the most. Which is also perfectly fine, because they are the economic majority. Users not as much, but still a little due to some ROI, and the ability to have some political influence via the consensus. As for traders, they at least wouldn't be worse off compared to PoW I suppose. That would mean a net gain with PoS I reckon, provided that security issues like the nothing-at-stake-problem were sufficiently addressed (e.g. with security deposits and vote-on-2-chains-proofs).

"> Holders are the economic majority.

I don't know what you mean by that.  Indeed they hold the vast majority of the bitcoins, and they could cause the price to crash if they lost faith and stopped holding.  

But usually ""the economy"" means industry, trade, and consumption.  When a community does not have these things, one says that their economy is dead, even if they are holding millions of tokens of any kind.

 In the case of bitcoin, there is little consumption (loss of keys).  The miners could be considered ""the industry"". Trade would be the exchanging of bitcoin for money, goods, or services.  So the holders are not contributing to the economy...

"I'll quote the OP:

> It turns out my bank (BoA) did the transfer as an overnight ACH, which Coinbase does not support. The 'specialist' assigned to my ticket told me that my bank needed to recall the ACH transfer.

What does he mean by ""not support"" more specifically in the above quote? To me it sounds like Coinbase's bank does not support the ""overnight"" feature of ACH and is therefore not allowing access to the funds to Coinbase.

I think the same problem would happen if I have a Swedish bank account that can receive SEK and EUR but you send GBP to my BIC/IBAN. The money will leave your account, go through a few intermediary banks, and finally reach my bank. My bank will probably just refuse to accept the payment and not notify me as the receiver that an attempt has even been made. 

Then the money has to travel back again before you can see that they've returned. Sometimes this traveling back can get stuck and manual intervention is needed.

I've never tried to receive GBP to my bank account in Sweden that only supports SEK and EUR, so I'm just speculating on what would happen. But don't you think that something similar has happened to this Coinbase customer and that it may be so that Coinbase has not even been notified by their bank that an ACH ""overnight"" transaction has even been attempted?";2;0;False;todu;djh9no8;Coinbase lost my $200,000 transfer on 5/30;6jtm04;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jtm04/coinbase_lost_my_200000_transfer_on_530/
