correlation/causation.

I can vouch for that forum.;2;0;False;solex1;da3kyx4;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
"I guess when I say ""holders"", I'm picturing people who have most or all of their money in bitcoin; i.e. ""believers"". These are the people who held from $1200 all the way down to $200. They'll *never* sell. They are the lifeblood of bitcoin. By virtue of storing their money in bitcoin, they are forced to do bitcoin transactions simply to survive. 

That's what I mean by ""bitcoin holders *are* users"".";1;1;False;futilerebel;da4okcn;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
Holders are speculators/investors. Users are ones who use it to buy things or trade, which is the point at which a price is established. I guess you could say that investing in it long term is using it too, but your investment won't actually be worth anything if it's not exchanged by people during that time.;3;1;False;Rassah;da4bje5;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
"I don't doubt it. A lot of people see a contentious hard fork as an attack on bitcoin, which even the possibility of success would reduce the value of it. Also Mike Hearn's views were published in the New York Times.

I talk to non-bitcoin enthusiasts sometimes and one common question is *""How can this 21m thing be real? It's just software, couldn't they change it""*. And then I explain how bitcoin consensus works and how full nodes reject invalid blocks as if they never existed, which is what makes rules like the 21m limit so hard to change.

If posting on reddit and twitter was enough to change the rules of bitcoin, it could mean the 21m limit isn't safe. At least that's how I interpret those price movements.";2;0;False;belcher_;da4fwfq;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
