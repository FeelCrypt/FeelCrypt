""No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain (various types of off-chain transactions are the only long-term solution)""

For a coin to be used world wide, some off chain method is needed to reduce the load on the main blockchain. Bch has no intention of implementing solutions like segwit or LN(or others). It's a short term solution in which roger ver wants to make as much money as possible.

"Possibly, but the practical part of how that would work is still unproven. In the event that you want to send BTC to your friend you would still have to put a transaction on the block chain so your not getting rid of that. 

It's benefit seems to be for situations where you do a lot of transactions with someone. Something I'm still a little confused about how logistically it'll really work or if it is even feasible because the act of opening up a payment channel ties up my funds. So I obviously wouldn't want to put more on the payment channel than for that one purchase. Even in situations where I know I will be paying someone frequently. Say a yearly subscription I pay monthly for. I wouldn't want to deposit the full year's cost in the payment channel and release the funds every month. If I wanted to lose those funds for a year I would have just paid for the year in advance.

"'lightning' is not 'running' in any meaningful way, anywhere.  The fact that you can manually open some payment channels on testnet (or even mainnet) is meaningless.

>Neither is the previous commenter's hypothetical ""easy-to-use dapp for low cost bitcoin transactions"".

that's even dumber, why would you create a dapp to do bitcoin transactions on Ethereum rather than just using Ether?";7;2;False;greeneyedguru;drmn4ut;PSA: It's faster and cheaper to get the private key delivered by FEDEX than making transactions on the Bitcoin network;7lfyrf;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lfyrf/psa_its_faster_and_cheaper_to_get_the_private_key/
"I get the routing part. It's the locking up of funds that doesn't seem feasible. The exchange will need to know how much money you plan on receiving and they will have to put that much money or more into the payment channel so they can transfer the money. That money is now locked up for the exchange and they can't use it for other customers. Even if no one ever sends you money the exchange can't use those coins. 

This means two things. Only the richest of people will be able to run exchanges in order to be able to support it's customers. Which means your going to get some serious centralization. 

The other issue is how are you and the exchange going to decide how much money the exchange put's into the channel. If you receive a lot of transactions then obviously you want to have the highest amount possible so you don't have to keep opening channels which cost more money. But if your the exchange you want the lowest amount possible because you don't want unnecessary funds tied up that could be better used on other customer transactions. 

I think what is going to happen is you will have a song and dance take place for anyone that wants to be able to receive any amount of money that will make the LN worth it. Because it'll take a lot of capitals to host a productive exchange only a very few will exist. This will be counterproductive to the distributed idea and allow the large exchanges to take advantage of people.

I envision the whole thing becoming highly centralized with that move. Think of the benefits you can get if you treat the exchanges as banks. You deposit all your money into their account. Now they just tell you how much money you have. They hold LN channels with tons of other exchange banks and transfer funds all over the place. Because they are large and hold a lot of money together they can create LN channels with an insane amount of funds. And also because hopefully they send close to equal amount of money back and forth those channels won't run out of money quickly like a one sided channel will. Transferring all of my coins to a exchange bank means I don't have to incur the cost of opening a LN channel or worry about deciding the amount of funds needed on both sides.

A good analogy is that doubling a road width only increases the number 9f cars by a constant, and you might need to double it again, but its still a better solution to do that than it is to just have one continuous traffic jam and no cars for 40 years while hoping eventually everyone buys a boat to travel on the congestion-free open ocean.

"The cryptos using graphs instead of linked lists are not going to go through these scaling problems (e.g., IOTA, Factom).

To remedy scaling on Bitcoin, a bigger block or a shorter interval in between blocks could be implemented (theoretically), however that would only allow for a constant increase in the amount of transactions per second (throughput).

What we really need are off-chain transactions, sidechains and perhaps even sharding (to allow for those big-ass blocks).

"I think there's still a big lingering question which is an issue of trust. Not just trust in the dev team, resilience of the cryptocurrency or technical merits, but trust in the *value* of the coin itself.

If we switch to a better coin every time some new exciting tech comes out, do we switch immediately? Without a way to peg the values, that means existing holders will lose out to people who bought the new coins first. It leads to a lot of uncertainty in the market, and also devalues the currency as a means of store-of-value. Your general average Joe definitely doesn't want to have to research new tech every 6 months and re-evaluate if he/she needs to liquidates the entire crypto savings for a new coin.

You could argue it's still early enough that we should experiment and try out new coins before we settle on longer term stability, which is fair, but at least this is why Bitcoin Cash has something different from the other non-BTC coins: it was a fork and traces back the value from the original chain.

While I do agree that there are some that do it better, Bitcoin (Core) has clearly demonstrated the absolutely fucking *massive* utility of first-mover advantage and Bitcoin Gold has clearly demonstrated the absolutely fucking *massive* utility of name/brand recognition.

"Litecoin is not faster than BCH. LTC has 1mb blocks with 2.5 minute block times. BCH has 8mb block with 10 minute block time. So BCH has twice the throughput of LTC.

BCH also supports 0 confirmation transactions which means small transactions can be trusted instantly. LTC has replace by fee so you can't do 0 confirmation transactions.

There are other coins that are faster than BCH but LTC is not one of them. Those coins don't have the same level of adoption as BCH though. 

BCH is a good balance of usefulness and adoption. It's faster than BTC and has lower fees while having the ability for all BTC infrastructure to be easily switched over to BCH. So exchanges, ATMs, wallets, credit cards, miners, and nodes can all add support for BCH really quickly. And since it is a fork of BTC is already has a large user base. This is ultimately what puts BCH ahead of all the other alts out there that are faster. 

Additionally you only need enough speed to handle the network. Anything past that is great for the future but presently unnecessary for operation.

"Aside from what everyone else said, I want to address a specific point that doesn't get addressed much:

> Litecoin is even faster will the 2 minute blocks. 

This doesn't matter. There are two measurements we care about:

1. Security of a transaction per period of time (often expressed as time to some amount of confirmation)
2. Number of transactions per period of time

Having faster blocks doesn't affect either of these on its own. For example, let's say we have an imaginary coin where have ten 1MB blocks per minute, or another coin with one 10MB block per minute, and it would be equivalent. You fit in the same amount of transactions per minute, and you get the same amount of mining security per minute (because to get ten blocks per minute, you're reducing the mining difficulty by 1/10).

There _are_ things you can do to get faster block times _and_ better security ([for example](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/)), but Litecoin is not doing anything there to my knowledge.";8;0;False;shazow;drmozk0;I'm not a fan of Bitcoin Cash for the record, but good god is the /r/bitcoin subreddit fucking garbage;7lhie4;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lhie4/im_not_a_fan_of_bitcoin_cash_for_the_record_but/

"**Virtue signalling**

Virtue signalling is the conspicuous expression of moral values done primarily with the intent of enhancing standing within a social group. The term was first used in signalling theory, to describe any behavior that could be used to signal virtue—especially piety among the religious. In recent years, the term has become more commonly used as a pejorative characterization by commentators to criticize what they regard as empty, or superficial support of certain political views, and also used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action.

Well, I can't spend it any more.  So I took the small amount I had left, and I cashed it out to USD on Saturday.  First time in 4 years I have ever even thought of doing that.

"I think a large part of the hesitation to go to Bitcoin Cash is the air around Ver himself. I didn't really know anything about Bitcoin Cash until the video of him flipping shit and bragging about being richer than Andreas went viral. I think Bitcoin Cash would be viewed much better by the masses if Roger wasn't so 'elitist' (probably not the right word, but close enough)

Bitcoin Cash has far more current and future usability, I think the actual use-case for the Lightning Network is far less than what is being said about it, and at this point, even if Segwit suddenly became 100% adopted it still wouldn't clear the mempool. And considering everyone keeps saying this is 'only the beginning' for crypto adoption, the backlog will only get worse.

"99% of all crypto speculators don't understand that.

**Speculation.**

 A lot of people think, “Speculation? Oh, that’s gambling.” Well, actually no. Speculation is allocating capital not to create more capital, but to take advantage of distortions and misallocations created in the market—usually by government interference. Gambling is to engage in a game of chance—roulette, dice, or the like. Since most people in the markets have no idea what they’re doing, they actually are gambling—just using their brokerage house as a casino. Perhaps that’s why people conflate the two things.

**Investment. Savings.**

Everybody uses these words, often interchangeably. But nobody ever defines them, because they don’t understand what they actually mean. So, they’re misused and conflated. What is investment? “Investment” is the allocation of a certain amount of capital to a productive enterprise, intended to create more capital. It’s like planting a seed. “Savings” is simply putting aside the fruits of past production. You should produce more than you consume. When you set aside the excess, that is savings. Saving creates capital, and with capital, you can invest. But now, the concepts of savings and investment are conflated. The difference between them is undefined and therefore uncertain in the public’s mind.

">How do you think bitcoin works? What will these impotent nodes do when they see ""foul play""? Call the police?

They ignore those blocks and disconnect from the node that sent them the block, which depending on how important those nodes are (exchanges, shops, etc) means that the chain with the invalid block becomes instantly worthless.

>They do not determine the validity of a block. 

The rules determine the validity, nodes verify that the blocks don't break the rules. 

>Only miners do that.

Validating a block isn't even needed to mine a block on top of it. Some miners have even publicly admitted that they don't verify blocks before starting to mine on top of them, to gain a time advantage. The real usefulness of miners is to choose an ordering for transactions and make the chain immutable. 

>Non-mining nodes literally do nothing for security of the network.

They make the network more resistant to DDOS for one, along with a few other benefits like the ones I'm claiming above.

>They *can* secure your individual transactions

Which for a business is quite important. 

>SPV wallets have the exact same security implications, and can be run without the storage overhead.

SPV wallets will gladly follow a block with invalid transactions on it as long as they're not your own. This means following a block that will be discarded.

"Thanks for your concern and this guide, but unfortunately it is inaccurate in many regards. I won't go over it in detail as a complete description of the roles of full nodes is available on [this wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node).

Full nodes do validate every block to make sure they follow the current consensus rules. They will reject blocks if they do not match these rules, even if the rest of the network reports such block as valid. So having enough full nodes does play a role in securing the network as these nodes emitting invalid blocks will get ignored eventually (and won't be able to feed incorrect info to SPV clients for example).

So in short, full nodes remove the centralization of these tasks which would lie only in the hands of miners otherwise. If you do not see the benefits of this, I might be inclined to think that you are willing to give your trust to miners to always behave in your best interest. That's not something I'm ready to do.

If the usefulness of full nodes isn't clear for you I honestly think you should not write guides about it. I hope you do not take this the wrong way or as a personal attack. I am sure it took you some time to write this, but for completeness you should really consider updating it to include the actual roles full non-mining nodes play in Bitcoin's network.";1;0;False;joeknowswhoiam;drlj0yz;You can now store a year's worth of continuously full 8MB blocks for the cost of a single BTC transaction;7l9468;https://m.newegg.com/products/9SIA5AD4TR8861

As per if 8 examined every line of code in my OS, obviously not, I've read only very small sections. But we're not discussing if it's secure, we're discussing if it's trustless.

>With ISPs, in order to verify your version of the blockchain, you need access to the blockchain (unless you are **trusting** a third party for their version, like an SPV client). An ISP could perform a middleman attack, making you believe that you have the blockchain with the most proof of work, while delivering you an inferior blockchain.

- HTTPS prevents the middle man attacks
- My ability to easily use several different connections (home, phone, coffeeshop) as well as the Bitcoin satellite prevents me from suffering from denial of service

"I'm not going to reply to all your sections, because many of them are related, and based on the same idea, which is a misconception. The bitcoin network is not a mesh network. It is much closer to a complete graph.

> They ignore those blocks and disconnect from the node that sent them the block, which depending on how important those nodes are (exchanges, shops, etc) means that the chain with the invalid block becomes instantly worthless.

""The chain with the invalid block"" is actually subjective. That's the whole point. Validity is decided by nodes doing work. Of course everyone could just ""agree"" to be honorable, but this is not backed by anything. Mining is what makes it have authenticity to everyone else. Other nodes that aren't mining literally have zero relevance. They can ignore blocks all they want, but miners will respect the work of other miners, and ignore these impotent nodes. Of course, miners do not tolerate invalid blocks from other miners. But if a bunch of impotent nodes decide to call a certain block invalid, and the majority of mining power disagrees, the impotent nodes don't matter. They don't have chain to fall back to, and they are completely slaves to the miners.

> SPV wallets will gladly follow a block with invalid transactions on it as long as they're not your own. This means following a block that will be discarded.

This is actually possible, but only if you aren't vigilant enough with your SPV wallet. You can actually query the entire network if you want that level of security. So, again, you have the **exact** same security guarantees as you would running an impotent node. With an impotent node, you can be fooled by miners you connect to. The solution is the same as with SPV. Connect with more, and be robust.

> You haven't thought this through, how long do you think this person would have unnoticed access to those machines? They don't own the machines, so they can't just keep mining for days or weeks. Their best bet would be to do the attack one night and make a huge double spend.

No, I've thought it through quite a bit. It is a resource with value, so spending that value on ""mischief"" is less desirable than spending it on earning something of value. Do you not understand the game theoretical part of the white paper?

That's an interesting point. Transactions handled by retail are usually processed in batch at the end of the day. The difference though being that the process provider has a way of covering fraudulent transactions and going after the card carrier. I believe this is the model lightning transactions are supposed to assist with because it would be like having a voucher for some reserve which makes it less likely that a person wouldn't transfer more funds before the block is actually processed, but since it is still essentially an anonymous transaction I don't see how that can be reconciled.

">They can ignore blocks all they want, but miners will respect the work of other miners, and ignore these impotent nodes.

And how is that working out for miners trying to sell Bitcoin Cash as if it was Bitcoin? Even if Bitcoin Cash becomes the chain with the most PoW, it won't matter, they won't be able to sell it as Bitcoin.

If the important entities are running nodes, they get to decide what rules they want to follow.

>But if a bunch of impotent nodes decide to call a certain block invalid, and the majority of mining power disagrees, the impotent nodes don't matter.

You call them impotent and yet they prevent miners from forcing businesses to follow rules they don't want and buying coins from the wrong chain.

>They don't have chain to fall back to, and they are completely slaves to the miners.

Game theory dude, if the money is on the other chain, there will be someone mining it. Mining is a job.

>So, again, you have the **exact** same security guarantees as you would running an impotent node.

How is it the exact same if one only needs one block to realize it's invalid and the other one needs to connect to _everyone_ to make sure the block is valid?

>No, I've thought it through quite a bit. It is a resource with value, so spending that value on ""mischief"" is less desirable than spending it on earning something of value.

You completely ignored my very simple example. Let me run the numbers for you:

You have 8 hours of access to what is probably more than 50% of the hashrate in mid-2009. You can earn roughly 50\*8\*4 BTC in that time (1600BTC) by being honest. That means any double spend over 1600BTC is better for you than being honest during those 8 hours. 

In 2010 a pizza was sold for 10000BTC, which was IIRC about $50 at the time.

Conclusion: In mid 2009 if you got access to more than 50% of the hashrate for 8 hours you'd make more money by double-spending $5 than being honest. 

This didn't happen.

>The people that were experimenting with it and testing it considered it valuable, and kept a good proportion of money earned mining.

Yea, except to implement LN you are going to need to introduce Segwit and LN first on BCH - it's not as if it can just be turned on overnight. Look at segwit right now on Bitcoin. It's got barely any adoption - but it is growing due to community demand. These things take time. And guess what? By the time BCH does all the things needed to release LN (if it ever does) and have full market adoption, Bitcoin will have a significantly more trafficked, better connected, more secure LN with mass market adoption, why would anyone ever use LN on BCH? Plus, if BCH ever gets to a point where they feel the need to implement LN, it would be admitting BCH failed.;-18;5;False;chazley;drmvelq;Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.;7lirko;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lirko/reminder_blockstream_and_core_got_100_of/

Fair, you don't technically need Segwit for LN, but I have NO idea why you would want a layer 2 solution to fix malleability issues without implementing segwit. Segwit literally makes transactions smaller so OBJECTIVELY, fees are always going to be smaller and blocks are more efficient.

The same ""nice things"" that Segwit allows can be obtained in a far more elegant way via hard-forks. BCH has a policy of hard-forks rather than soft-forks, so it's going get to the same ""nice things"" but without a legacy of spaghetti-code or breaking existing model.

"At the end of the day though, you solved the problem sooner than they did, yet you did it in a very simple and obvious way. BCC has the advantage atm, but I believe it's a short term advantage. I'm still willing to bet that BTC will overtake BCC in the long term simply because their scaling solution is about fitting more transactions in a single 1mb block rather than just raising the size of the block, AKA: being more efficient, not to mention I trust them much much more. 

That doesn't mean that BCC's price can't overtake BTC's price in the short term, alot of crazy stuff is going to go down in the next 6 months purely because of the fact that there's so much new money flowing into the ecosystem, but... when that stops, party is on temporarily hiatus for everyone.

Also, I used BCC the other day and it took just as long as bitcoin, over 1h to receive me funds and my ledger won't even let me pay a low fee anyways, so I don't see much of a difference from my stand point. If anything I am bugged by all the rhetoric on both subs and it's turning me off of bitcoin completely.

This is the first time Bitcoin has actually had honest-to-god scaling issues that wasn't purely manufactured by bad actors. Give them some time, I think they will surprise you.

Either way, I like both coins, but I could never chose one of them that's trying this hostile take over stuff and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels that way.  When I got into Bitcoin I saw it as a much safer investment than I do now. There was only one bitcoin before, one bitcoin address, a handful of bitcoin exchanges, and one bitcoin forum I frequented. Now you have to hold 2 types of bitcoins to ""hedge"" against one losing versus the other, you gotta move your coins to new ""segwit"" from ""legacy"" address, or make sure you aren't sending BTC to BCH (even tho you can stil laccess the funds with the private key its a pain in the ass dude lol). 

If bitcoin wasn't user friendly before, it sure as hell isn't now... either chain lol. It's got more confusing to the average user, not less. If anything the waters are muddy and it's hard to tell what's up and what's down... But, I don't expect anyone to listen to me lol.

Either way, it's dangerous to follow these coins in such a cult-ish manner as it inevitably clouds your judgement and you become partial to one coin over another, regardless whether one is doing better than the other. This goes for both sides lol.

Hell, let's be honest here... the coin that's going to win is the one thats first out of the gate with the capability to do 30k+ transactions a second, near instant transactions for the user, and doesn't take tons of power. Imo, alot of coins are already beat, including both iterations of Bitcoin.";4;5;False;bitcoin_halp;drmumgu;Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.;7lirko;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lirko/reminder_blockstream_and_core_got_100_of/

"""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe

double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

"Are you confusing possibility with practicality?

A name is an identity label - if I wanted to identify you on reddit, I'd call you LookAnts. You are defined by what people on this website know you through your actions - that being your posts (past, present and future) as well your karma points, personality, etc. These things can, and will, change over time. If you became famous on Reddit, and changed from a BCH supporter to a BTC supporter, you'd still be identified through majority recognition, as LookAnts.

This is key when identifying the difference between Bitcoin/BTC and Bitcoin Cash. The understanding of every single crypto-exchange in the world is that BTC is Bitcoin. No matter what happens, no matter if it plummets to the ground and becomes worth $1 per BTC, it will still be Bitcoin. Because an identity of an asset, much like that of a person, isn't defined by what they should have been - it's defined by what they are, at this present moment.

Bitcoin is not easily transactionable. Bitcoin Cash is easily transactionable. Bitcoin is worth $11k+. Bitcoin Cash is worth sub $4k. Bitcoin has a capped block size. Bitcoin Cash doesn't.

They're different. To want BCH to be recognized as Bitcoin at this stage of the game just brings confusion to potential investors, and somewhat encourages mistaken purchases between BCH and BTC. This is tantamount to fraud at worst, and just plain confusing at best.

"To me, much of this sounds like you've read some common talking points passed around in other arenas and accepted them as truth without diving into the details behind the points.

>Sustainable fees to pay for the proof of work instead of a block reward that is halving every 4 years seem to me the only way forward. 

If the price ONLY doubled in 4 years, you'd have equivalent security to today.  Keep in mind, that Bitcoin price has averaged over 3x / year for most of it's history.  That's an increase of 40 fold AFTER the halving.  So, based on history (or how else would you make any projections), we can expect 40 times as much security for the network from price increase alone without factoring in fees.  That's about $1trillion dollars per day in security.  $1 Trillion.  Let that sink in...  And you want fees to be added to that?  Is your personal wallet secured at the same level as national nuclear codes just because more security is better?

>the only viable way to make bitcoins a world wide currency is to create a payment network like Lightning

How can you say this when there are SO many alternate ways to approach crypto scaling in process? Have you read any of the counterarguments for Lightning?  This network security that you were just talking about is decreased due to Lightning - miner fees are reduced.  If Lightning had majority use in a blockchain, it potentially destroys the carefully balanced incentive model between users and miners.  There are technical challenges that haven't been overcome at smaller scales much less tested in a world-wide application.  Lightning does offer some potential advantages and have some good use cases - but basing the entire Bitcoin future on that one concept while everyone else in crypto is looking into various solutions seems crazy to me.  Perhaps I'm overstating your personal view here, but it is such a common talking point that ""Lightning will just make everything better, soon (TM)"" that it gets my ire up.

What you're asking for is not Lightning but rather SPV.  SPV says each individual user can observe the network at a level that requires minimal personal effort with maximum assurance.

Radio transmissions can be triangulated to find the source - is that really something that is going to allow an individual to escape the reach of the state?  If you're talking about nations crossing borders, I'd expect there are many other concerns than currency.  In those conditions, people are likely using barter systems for subversive economic systems.  And perhaps if such conditions exist it need not be the domain of a worldwide monetary standard to server those particular needs when a more suitable crypto could be used instead.

"I don't like high fees either, but like anybody else I was quickly skeptical of a blockchain scaling to a massive payment network. Sustainable fees to pay for the proof of work instead of a block reward that is halving every 4 years seem to me the only way forward. Sure we could have lower security blockchains with less usage to keep doing on chain transactions, but at some point the only viable way to make bitcoins a world wide currency is to create a payment network like Lightning. 

Personally I'm happy to see Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum... even Ripple and many others compete with what they think is the right model. Unfortunately solve less of the global banking problems and rampant money printing than others, but I think all of them, probably even Ripple are a step forward. Bitcoin Core might just be a bit too ambitious in thinking that maximum decentralization can scale to enough users fast enough.

"This is what I've prior referred to as the fork of visions for Bitcoin. This psychological fork preceded the real fork.

The vision for Bitcoin used to be the complete opposite of what you're espousing. It was about decentralized, censorship-resistant transactions that were extremely low-cost, only coming at the trade-off of waiting for block confirmation (an inevitable result of any blockchain system). Bitcoin was supposed to free Venezuelans from hyperinflation, capital controls and government-sponsored violence. It was supposed to lift up a class of under-banked or unbanked individuals who for whatever reason were locked out of the banking system.

Now, Bitcoin (Core) has happily wed itself with the legacy financial system. What most people mean by ""bitcoin"" is really coinbase since they don't even own their own private keys nor do they make on-chain transactions.

(Yes, for sending $100,000 fees are negligible. They're not negligible for as high as $1000. 40/1000 is a ridiculous percentage.

"> the incentive of a miner to mine without collecting fees?

Supporting userbase and future profits. Bitcoin tx has two and only two parameters: validity by current Nakamoto consensus and economic feasibility

Supply and demand of blockspace for winning miner: If miner can produce as much as he wants, currently able to produce 3 and recieved 2 in txs with fees and 1 in txs without fees, there's more to lose than to gain by excluding the latter - slower network effect, less money made in the future. Network effect directly influences mining profitability and, **more importantly**, stable level of future profitability. Miner wants to eat, fuck and buy lambos today, tomorrow, next week and next year. If he has 3 and recieved 4 in txs without fees, he'll discriminate and cut 25% off from this block. If there'll be no txs with fees, miner will eventually go bankrupt and sooner or later open blockchain will become insecure

It's not what actually happens. We don't need to theoretisize much: just watch charts of early years of Bitcoin and current charts of Bitcoin Cash to get idea of fee market when blocks aren't full.

">Shouldn't the increase of miners, reduce the amount of transaction fees?

No, this is a common misconception. At difficulty level N, increasing hashrate *does* increase network throughput. But it's a losing battle, because difficulty adjusts after a couple thousand blocks and then we're back to an average 10 minute block time.

The only way to scale on-chain is to make the chain bigger, period [or transactions smaller]. Segwit does this (higher block size) too, but with an ugly, convoluted accounting trick - they ""pretend"" that Segwit blocks ""weigh less"", even though they don't, which is the same as a blocksize increase but only conditional upon segwit activation. To me this is very, very bad...obviously BTC supporters don't seem to think so.

I also personally don't understand *why* witness data would need to be moved into its own section. Do you have any insight on that to share? Segwit just seems so ugly to me

It is always a time of uncertainty and uncertainty kills currencies.

"Sorry you got downvoted. I don't think you're right but I do think you're contributing to the discussion.

Miners don't need fees as an incentive until after coins dry up. However, a small amount of fees is healthy. 1000 satoshi/byte is not. As long as the transaction fee is > epsilon, where epsilon is an arbitrary constant >0, then it should be beneficial to the miners to include the transactions.

>I mean, with the increase in transactions due to the low-fees, the 32MB will eventually not be enough.

Eventually, yes. I'm a proponent of slow exponential blocksize growth

>If increased for example, to 1GB (pure speculation), how would it work?

The same way 1MB works? It would take years to reach 1GB, at which point if we have near-visa-level tx throughput, then the network has succeeded and there should be plenty of capital to put towards non-mining nodes and especially mining nodes.

(If non-mining nodes are such a centralization risk, BTC is fucked too.

"I prefer to look at crypto-currencies with a more practical and common view.
For example, I always try to look at from the point of view of someone who is not a computer-science person. 
I understand the terms, I understand *the thing*. But the common-folk doesn't.
I know for a fact that when I try to explain to a non-computer person what a blockchain fork is, their new question is  *""So, which one of the new coins shall I use?""*
This is indecision. 

A currency needs to have the capability to store value in the long term. Common folks like that. They like things which they can count on in the long term, especially if it's money. If common people have uncertainty about the future of a currency, its value gets affected and people get scared and cash-out to a more stable currency. This is real life with every other fiat-currency.

"This is where we must disagree. In my opinion, the only sensible approach is to view forks as healthy. They are a natural part of open, decentralized software development (where did the term 'fork' come from?).

Soft vs hard fork is an arbitrary division. I get what it means, but is Segwit really ""soft"" if adoption is only at 10% or whatever level it's at? Right now Segwit looks like a minority soft fork.

Hard forks aren't scary, currencies like XMR do them all the time. You have to after a certain point to get things done.

The best way to activate hard forks is to choose an arbitrary future block to activate. This is in line with what Satoshi recommended.

Here, read this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/

Note how Theymos actually was quite spot-on on what would happen. He thought that he could hold Bitcoin by the balls and censor opinions he didn't like, and as a result he forced a fork. Now we have two relevant bitcoins, each squandering valuable resources on attacks (personally I think the BTC side is conducting the majority of the 'attacks' but I try to avoid even going there due to all the panic about BCH being a pump-and-dump attack. I prefer to focus on the technology, which is what made me choose BCH)

People mistrust Bitcoin. But not because of the current situation. They haven't heard anything about the current situation, and they've never had any coin of any sort. All we have to do is give people BCH so they can play with it, and then they can feel like they're inside-- and BTC can't do that. BTC went around yelling at merchants to take BTC, and they did, but then nobody went to any of those stores they HODLed instead.

Not to mention any amount of coin worth less than the fee amount becomes unspendable. Exchanges are saying that a large chunk of coins in their storage is now unmovable. So what are those coins worth?

"BCH doesn't have to compete with other classical blockchain and BTC clones, because it blows them away by good functionality and low fees. If I'm to compare BCH with classical superheroes like Batman or Iron Man, his main opponents are neither Superman or Joker. These guys are thing of the past. 

BCH's main opponents are 

- The *new kids on the block*, the X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Harry Potter coins which doesn't waste power by mining, doesn't have the cumbersome blockchain tech, have instant transfers and zero fees. These kids are a serious contender to the throne, and only thing stopping them right now is that they're mostly unknown, don't have working mobile or desktop wallets, or aren't on main exchanges.

- The strange heroes such as Vertigo's Sandman, Lucifer Morningstar, or Motoko Kusanagi. These strange heroes represent the hidden and subtle world of fungible, anonymous coins such as Monero, Zcash and many others alike. They might be even more serious contender to the throne than the new kids because these strange coins offer *true cash* experience, fully untraceable exchange of value. What might hinder their advancement is that they are all based on old blockchain technology, so the scaling problems seen in BTC might be their doom too.

"Same here. I was using Bitcoin for all sorts of minor things several years ago. About a dozen commercial transactions per month. Plus I would play around with different wallets and stuff. I like to experiment. As fees slowly went up, I stopped using it for these small things. I still thought BTC would be useful for larger commercial transactions though, so would still be a good store of value. I also stopped experimenting with wallets and stuff which means I was not keeping up with the technology. Tx prices went up some more and I stopped even using my own wallets. If someone wanted to send me BTC, I just gave them an exchange address. So now fees were discouraging me from controlling my own private keys. Occasionally, I would pay a few dollars to move from one exchange to another, but was still getting by with cripplecoin. When I paid a $15 fee, I knew it was high, but I wanted to make sure my tx was confirmed fairly fast. Wow, was I surprised. Checking the mempool and calcuating my tx size, I realized now that I should have paid about $35 to get confirmed within a few hours.

Eventually, I tried a double spend with much higher fees, but I couldn't get any of the networks to accept the pushtx. Guess I should have used the RBF flag, but my wallet doesn't do that, I would have needed to created a manual tx. I finally sent the other half creating a child pays for parent tx. Paid a total of $85 in fees to move her one input wallet to an exchange. I am converting them all now after seeing how bad it is. I have enough time locked coins with dates in the future and can easily restore her BTC half if I am wrong and BTC is the winner (which I doubt VERY much now).

And here I am an engineer that has made his own wallets, yet I still messed up. How is a regular person going to use Bitcoin Core? How are they suppose to allocate and reserve fees for future lightning transactions closures? Guess to low and they will have to do an extra transaction to pay an accelerator or do a child-pays-for-parent large fee transaction. Who is going to manage their own private keys when moving Bitcoins to your personal wallet costs you a days wages?

It has gone from bad to insane. Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin anymore. It is some Frankenstein creation. I feel angry, sad, and disgusted.

"As someone relatively new to cryptocurrencies WTF is the point of a litecoin? Seriously?

At first I was confused by hearing ""Silver to Bitcoin's Gold"" since it makes absolutely no sense when worded like that. After researching I later learned it was referring to the way people minted coins out of silver, as gold was too precious for use as a currency.

So after some research I hear the founder Charlie Lee spewing the same zealot nonsense maximalist spew. Constantly FUD'n altcoins ect. but dude, you are pumping a fucking altcoin yourself. It's best (and only useful) feature is that it's listed on coinbase as it's not made any headway in merchant acceptance.

The contradictions continued as I learned Litecoin had no innovative features. It's basically the same thing as bitcoin x4, and used as a testnet for Segregated Witness, and will also test lightning networks before lightning is deployed on Bitcoin. So basically, if either of those scaling solutions are successful and make Bitcoin Core usable again, in the best case scenario Litecoin will be made obsolete.

Scenario 2, (more plausible) After reading about how lightning network will work, it's hot garbage. Literal dumpster fire that was sparked by a bolt of altcoin envy. Nobody will put down a deposit just to be able to use what should be a ""trustless"" payment network. Besides, you'll probably have a better chance of merchants accepting cryptocat sperm by the time Segregated Witness, and Lightning are ready to be FULLY deployed.  If they wanted to make an altcoin, they should have just made one. Bitcoin was cool in my opinion because of it's secure simplicity. Your average math student could learn to hash it out with a calculator and pencil. That's beautiful.

Maybe I'm missing something here because I'm not part of the cult, and drinking the same koolaid the Maximalists have been during the rise of altcoins. As far as I can guess, LTC is practically worthless moving forward. I'd rather invest in Dogecoin. I bet Charlie Lee had a moment of clarity and secretly traded it for BCH, giving up your HODL when you're the founder to be able to argue online better makes no sense.";17;1;False;5boros;drlhzao;/r/bitcoin for years: No altcoin discussion, have a ban! /r/bitcoin now: use Litecoin if you actually need to transact!;7lcafe;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lcafe/rbitcoin_for_years_no_altcoin_discussion_have_a/
