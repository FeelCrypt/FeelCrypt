"At this point I am unsure helping MtGox Legal exclusively would be for the best of this case. Until there is any progress it doesn't make sense to even start putting together a CR plan as we don't know yet what the requirements will be, and there remain a big obstacle for CR to happen at all.

Because of my position I cannot really endorse one or another creditors group, and while not all creditors group have a forum/etc ready, most have at least a website. I know there are at least 4 groups out there, but I'm not even sure if it's everything or not.

I know I initially offered to help. At the time the situation was much more confused than today and there was a general lack of understanding of the situation with the surplus at the time, the creditors meeting with the trustee however woke up a lot of people, and not only people are more informed now, someone actually filed for civil rehabilitation.

"Hi Mark, We've asked you repeatedly to help Mt Gox Legal reach out to people who are genuine creditors (using your mailing list of former customers) so we can give them FREE access to the forum we run. I'm asking you again to help us do that so the information we have already on the forum and the future developments can be shared with known creditors. As you know sharing information freely with the wider public restricts what can be said, so we need a way to verify creditors are real and you sending an invite to people on your mailing list would be a really helpful way of achieving that.

We aren't asking for anymore money from anyone. We already have a sizeable fund for legal costs, donated by creditors who joined and gave of their own free will. You yourself advised people to get legal advice, which I'm sure you know isn't free, so you HAVE effectively told people to spend money, and rightly so. Spending it on a shared lawyer is cheaper than hiring your own. 

In your latest email to me you said you were reluctant to help because you thought we were against you and we wouldn't co-operate. We aren't, but actually feels that you are against us and aren't co-operating. 

And who is ""us""? We a co-operative of creditors. Over 900 so far. Individual creditors with nothing else in common than they lost money on Mt Gox. The sort of people you are saying you are trying to help. In the 6 months Mt Gox Legal has been going have you heard any one of those 900 members leaving the group, bemoaning or criticizing what we're doing, calling it a scam? They would have filled reddit by now if it was. So if the people who are involved are satisfied with what it's doing, why don't you relax your resistance?

We make decisions by vote, and that's why we'd like more creditors to be involved in what we're doing. We've asked you a number of times to help us achieve that by helping us to open the forum for free access to known creditors. 

Now I'm asking you publicly again. Will you help this time? ";9;2;False;andypagonthemove;dwwz3km;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.;89o171;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89o171/im_mark_karpelès_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/

"Essentially Bitcoin is a new financial product. But I agree with you it's way more disruptive than maybe all financial products before it.  

A decent comparison is the internet itself.  It's not really directly regulated (globally, but it is in some countries) because that's impossible.  However those individuals/companies that use it are regulated.  If Bitcoin is to become mainstream I see no real difference here. So we need to manage the narrative with regulators to ease acceptance rather than ignore and dismiss them enabling the FUD to set the tone.

The things listed here about governments losing control of money supply are provocative (to them) and will lead to a far less receptive response than a more positive, collaborative approach.  

It would be great just to say FU to the government but this only delays adoption by years maybe decades.

Of course they will act in their best interest to keep the currency going and gain more money for themselves. But this is about *control*. At the end of the day the main developer wants *control*. You could say that Dash is centralised because the main developer can effect a large degree of control over the protocol. Eventually this only leads to oligarchy.

We're not talking about an insignificant bunch of Dash premined at the beginning. We're talking about *25 percent* of the total current supply that is circulating. If you want to compare that to Satoshi who mined his coins *fairly* over a number of years then that's a silly comparison. It's theorised Satoshi has 1,000,000 coins so that as a percentage of the current circulating supply is less than 6%. See the difference? People can say the preminers just dumped them on the exchanges. No proof to that. They could have just moved the money around to make it look like that. In reality they wanted a 25% stake in a potentially global currency to try exert financial dominance or control over the world.

"That video is such a joke. This guys intentionally mixed truth with lies and with his wild assumptions- it was debunked in dash subreddit a long time ago.

Why Dash community isn't hiding it? Because if you investigate the case thouroughly you will came to assumption that is really doesn't matter after 4 years.

"I was there supporting Mike during the whole shitshow and I largely agree with his assessment. What worries me is what we could have possibly gotten wrong.  
1. What if the primary utility value of Bitcoin is not use in transactions?
2. What if we got the economics wrong? For example the classic economic equation MV=PQ implies that an increase in transactions (which is positively correlated with an increase in velocity) acts as effectively an increase in coin supply so by suppressing transactions, core contributed to Bitcoin's utility as a store of value.
3. What if overvalue some of the factors that contribute to utility present in Dash and undervalue the factors (such as superior infrastructure) present in Bitcoin?

Overall I think Hearn is right and Dash has a significant long-term advantage.  The lack of sophistication of new investors, short-term thinking of momentum-chasing day traders, and the greater number of fiat on-ramps pushed Bitcoin over the top and will keep it there for a time. As Dash catches up however, we can expect to see a whittling away of BTC market share, provided Dash core meets its development goals and we can find and choose a marketing method that results in a self-perpetuating ROI as the treasury grows.

The biggest problem I see going forward has little to do with Bitcoin other that to note that it has the same issue: volatility. A store of value coin is not as handicapped by volatility as one designed to actually be used as a currency. A tricked out UX like Evolution won't change that. We need good traders to buy the dips and sell the peaks, make profits and eat vol. It's a huge opportinity for people who know what they are doing or who get lucky and it is a minefield for those who don't.

The quest for power over others is a sign of weakness, when you're strong you don't need to rule over others, you aren't scared of them and so you don't need to subdue them to your will to feel safer about your survival. But those that want to rule will have a harder time ruling over others when they lose control of money. And those that want to be ruled will come to realize that they have nothing to fear by having more control over their lives, on the contrary.

The situation around the covert premine/fastmine/instamine/scam is that the founder _still_ has 256,000 Dash. What's he doing with all that? Just leaving it sitting in a wallet? That's 256 possible masternodes that could be earning for him. Seems illogical to just leave it in a wallet. Anyway that definitely skews the voting system.

Also can you _prove_ that all the premined coins actually got on exchange? Can you prove they were traded with someone else? Or were they just wash traded to make it look like the preminers got rid of their coins? I bet the majority of the preminers still have most of their coins as that was the main goal in the beginning.
