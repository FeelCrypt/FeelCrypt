"It fixes transaction malleability; transaction ids can be changed by others right now.

This makes life difficult for developers of bitcoin applications (including wallets). Although most applications are theoretically possible without this fix, it makes them very complex and thus difficult and more risky. 

Payment channels and sidechains are one of the things that are easier with this fix. There are more applications that are already invented on paper, or with some code, and probably many not yet invented. All easier with this fix.

I am a developer and see how this fix helps future  innovation. Not everything has been invented yet. This is the internet in 1997. SegWit supports innovation because it gives developers more freedom to build new things.

"The 1.7MB ""claim"" was based on the miners test net article: the Bitfury analytics team’s research concluded that 1.7 MB was the average block size based on their experiment conducted on the bitcoin testnet.

""More importantly, WhalePanda noted that 1.7 MB is theoretical and other numbers such as 2.1 MB or Lightning co-author Thaddeus Dryja’s 3.7 MB are also all hypothetical. The only issue with Segwit which the miners, especially the Chinese mining community struggles to deal with, is that it can’t guarantee a specific block size due to a wide range of variables including different transaction types and circumstances.""

"Hello /r/all. For several years Bitcoin has been facing an issue with increasing it's capacity to handle transactions. The community has been locked in a stalemate on how to progress for about three years. There are two visions for Bitcoin's future. One is to allow more transactions to be processed on the blockchain every ten minutes. The other is to add some functionality to move the transactions off the blockchain.

Block 478559 was the first bitcoin block to allow more transactions to be processed every ten minutes on the blockchain. It signifies the two competing ideas going separate ways. The scaling via off-chain transactions camp does not recognize this block as valid, and the scaling on-chain transactions camp have this transaction to mark the beginning of their strategy. 

Many people, especially on /r/btc, think this is a return to the philosophy behind Bitcoin. Most people who watch the Bitcoin space are relieved that the debate could finally be over. The only question that remains is which blockchain will succeed. 

I don't think either will fail, but I think they will be useful to different classes of users. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will be for individuals who don't want government/bank/etc involvement in their money, and Bitcoin Core (BTC) will probably be useful to banks and large companies.";43;2;False;hiver;dl118y8;478559 (BCH) was mined!;6qy4df;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/

"Congrats! 

I am not on any side if there are only two sides.

I am in favour of SegWit and a block increase in the near future. Will still run a Core node (sorry) for now, but that does not mean I am not happy to see a fork like this happen because a lot of people want it. I believe Bitcoin is designed to work like this.

I hope this makes it clear that not everyone is in a camp, and that even people who do like SegWit can be happy with this fork.";15;3;False;Annom;dl0zw2o;478559 (BCH) was mined!;6qy4df;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/

">Segwit is a much more radical change than a block size increase.

I'll give you that. It is however far more thoroughly tested and an opt-in feature. If SegWit transactions scare you, don't use them, and you'll still gain the benefit of increased transaction capacity since others using it will free up base block capacity.

If you want to talk about radical changes, how about making consensus changes to your hard fork days before the fork occurs? Where is the testing, exactly?

"Don't take advice from random strangers on the internet like me: but I think if people were going to sell off BTC it would already be happening. The price barely dipped, so it seems a lot of the market isn't concerned about missing out on BCH.

Now, if BCH really takes off, BTC might plummet, but that'll probably take a day or more to take effect, there's not even a single BCH block yet, and blocks are going to be this slow for many hours before the difficulty readjustment.

Personally, my strategy is more around BCH. I think most traders are taking the ""don't touch your coins"" advice right now, but I think the BCH price will tank over the next week when tons of people with zero interest in BCH are trying to sell. BCH has lots of support, but no where near as many people / as much money supporting it as there are (in my estimation) apathetic people who don't care and just want ""free money"". I think the price will continue to fall until the majority of the ""free money"" seekers have traded away their BCH, then I think it will climb again.

I'm also placing a few ridiculously low limit orders, especially for BCH as soon as I can (e.g. $10 or even $0.10), so that if someone comes on the exchange and wipes out the order sheet by making a huge sell (as happened with ETH on GDAX a while ago), I can sweep up some super cheap coins. It's unlikely to happen, but I'll be there just in case, and it's more likely to happen when the volume is super small (like it will be now). This is a tricky and risky and pain in the ass strategy though, so I wouldn't really recommend it. I'd probably recommend holding and keeping an eye on the BCH price over the next few days and scoop some up if it crashes really low.

Another useful thing to look at is the BCH / BCC futures price, e.g. here:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/

"> segwit specifically gives a discount to off-chain transactions

No it does not. It discounts *signature data* in SegWit transactions. This is for two reasons

1. To allow it to occur via soft fork
2. To incentive the consumption and disincentivize the creation of UTXOs

I think we are now seeing first hand that soft forks are less disruptive than hard forks. Since the UTXO set should ideally be kept in memory, it's good to make people pay extra to create UTXOs, and pay less to spend them.

I actually support an increase in the base block size, when it can be done safely. To me that means giving some of the glaring inefficiencies, which SegWit does in a well tested way. Other things I'd like to see before a hard fork are better block propagation, SPV fraud proofs, maybe Schnorr signatures (but not if they take too long). I'd also like to see some of the hard fork wishlist items go into a block size hard fork, along with a lot of testing.

"Edit 3: Just disregard everything in this post. I am not up to date at all.

It is as soon as a reorg on BCC is unlikely. So probably about 6 blocks on the BCC chain. Furthermore make sure the tx has replay protection enabled.

Edit: As many people suggest otherwise, I checked the spec. It states that BCC nodes should follow blocks > 1 MB if a hardfork is detected after the activation time. This means any hardfork one block later than the first block after activation could be reorged by a single block directly after activation date, as the path to the longer chain has to follow a small block first. While this technically means BCC could fork from a different block than the first it can not be reorged to do so by a longer chain forking from a later block of the small block chain.

So my new statement is: Wait for one block on the BCC chain, make sure that it forks at the first block after the activation time and enable replay protection. This should be sufficient to make sure the BCC chain can not have the transaction.

Edit 2: Other people are right again. The format was changed one week ago to make replay protection mandatory. BCC will reject any transaction valid on the original chain.

"Bitcoin's community has been divided on how to best scale the network to support more transactions.  One group wants to scale ""off chain"" and use Bitcoin's blockchain for settlement (fewer transactions, higher fees).  The other group wants to scale ""on chain"" (more transactions, lower fees) and enable off chain scaling through a means other than Segregated Witness implemented by Bitcoin Core as a soft fork.  Since consensus hasn't been reached and congestion is becoming a problem, it's better that the chains split per ideology and the market can vote on each.

They have already paid a lot of BCC sellers at 0.1 BTC per BCC. Imagine everyone starts to withdraw that 0.1 BTC. The price of BCC was artificially fixed at no less than 0.1 for several days.

was properly rejected by the BCC nodes.

I fail to see the irony.  ViaBTC got its BTC reward for this block.  If BTC and BCC truly fill different economic niches, then broadening the applicability of SHA256 hashing hardware can only benefit the miners that own them.  If they compete, then its better (for SHA256 miners) for one of them to eventually win than for an alt-coin with a different hash alg to do so (i.e. the flippening).
