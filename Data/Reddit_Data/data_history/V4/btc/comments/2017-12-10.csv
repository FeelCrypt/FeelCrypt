There’s no such thing as converting bitcoin to USD. If you have bitcoin and you want USD you have to find someone that wants bitcoin and has USD, and then you trade. There are exchanges that do this for you. The same amount of bitcoin and USD existed at the beginning and end of the transaction, nothing was destroyed or created. Likewise if you have fake USDT and you want bitcoin, you have to find someone that has bitcoin and wants USDT, and you trade. You recieve someone else’s bit coin and some else gets the fake USDT, so now there’s more USDT than their used to be. This scam would never increase the amount of bitcoin or USD, only the USDT.;3;0;False;cleverusername10;dr0uzil;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/

There’s no way that random people outside of the federal reserve can make more USD. It just isn’t possible. They can scam others out of their USD but only the federal reserve can make new ones. You guys are on witch hunts with no idea how anything works. USDT is something that some guy made up. Making fake USDT doesn’t change anything on the Federal Reserve’s books and cannot create USD. USD has nothing to do with USDT outside of what some random guy says about it.;3;1;False;cleverusername10;dr0svsm;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/
"Haha no at all. The tether hack is very sketchy and I don't buy any of the company line. I watch Tether closely because I am a trader and I think it is important to understand. All I am trying to do is present plausible answers to questions. As the saying goes  ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""

"I was thinking about this more and I also wonder if the recovery will be slower than it otherwise would be because some % of would-be investors are going to stay out of it because it's unregulated. ""Don't bother investing in crypto - they can take your money and nobody can do anything about it.""

Or governments push for regulation which keeps legit exchanges from getting involved, which would also push the price down.

I don't think this is a long-term problem, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where it significantly inhibits the recovery in the short- and intermediate-term. But it's obviously super to predict what's going to happen with so many different factors.

"I should be careful branding it as a ""call option"", given we're talking about futures. It will be made available on the Chicago mercantile exchange, as a means of locking in the future price of the asset. 

Step number one is opening a brokerage account. You may want to use Fidelity, as their fees are more acceptable in my opinion. Then you will need to wait until these derivatives are actually listed there. With your money in fiat, you can expect to pay a premium of anywhere between 5-10 % for a 2-3 months futures contract.

Btw. You can also purchase this at OKex.com, but you will need a VPN as they do not accept traders from the US and will ban you based on your IP address. Tether poses a systemic risk to the Bitcoin economy, and you're being very wise in exploring ways of mitigating that risk. 

Best of luck.

">Alright, so if Bitfinex-B belongs to a miner, what are they mining? They are receiving Tether to this address, which isn't a coin that's mined. Also, why does it receive hundreds of millions of Tether from Bitfinex-A?

No idea what they are mining but if you mine any coin transfer it to finex and then sell it for USD then choose to transfer it to another exchange, my understanding is that is done through tether.

>Except I've used Bittrex and any time I've deposited anything there, I can view it on the blockchain existing inside the address, having never been ""forwarded"" to another central wallet. If they're moving the coin after I deposit, how do they make it look like my deposit address still contains coin on the blockchain?

Are you talking about depositing USDT to Bittrex or some other coin?";4;1;False;phd-oak;dr0uz67;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/
"If you have usdt tether, you are in a good position if prices fall further. If prices crash it will be a fire sale for those who have usdt. It's kind of ironic that those who have been listening to this tether crash nonsense, are the one's losing money, and those holding usdt are the ones making money.

If you worried and have usdt on an exchange, just move it. ";1;0;False;cid42;dr0tc30;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/
"It might not be miners, but the reason I think it is because its serialized, repetitive, and occurs on a somewhat regular schedule regardless of market conditions. If it was miners I would imagine that the main benefit they would get from sending their coins to Bitfinex as opposed to Bittrex would be Finex's lending market which would allow them to lend out whatever they were mining and earn a return on it before selling or while they were waiting to sell.

I don't know a lot of specifics of on how Bittrex handles deposits of other currencies, but if it is as you described then yes I am saying that they handle USDT deposits differently. It seems that way to me at lesat, but this could be easily cleared up by someone that works at Bittrex. As for why? I think it makes sense from a security perspective for the exchanges to hold all tether in their own wallets because Tether is essentially a centralized private service. It doesn't really matter if the exchange wallet gets hacked because they can just blaklist/freeze all the tether from the hack like they did with the recent Treasury ""hack"". If you figured out some exploit that allowed you to steal 100M out of the Bittrex hot wallet there is 0% chance you would ever see a dime of that money because you have to be fully verified to deposit or withdraw tether. Even if you could ""hack"" and exchange transfer it to another exchange fast enough to buy some other crypto before they catch on they could always go back and easily trace it down.";4;0;False;phd-oak;dr20lgg;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/

"So are you saying someone is mining hundreds of millions worth of some cryptocurrency, transferring it to Bitfinex and selling it for Tether, to transfer to their Bittrex account? If your plan is to mine cryptocurrency and send it to Bittrex, why don't you just send it to Bittrex? Either way you have to wait for confirmations. Why go through Bitfinex first? 

I've only ever transferred non-USDT cryptocurrency to Bittrex, so that's what I'm talking about. Why would they treat USDT differently?

In economics, a free market is an idealized system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a regulated market, in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as tariffs used to restrict trade and protect the economy. In an idealized free market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy.

In scholarly debates, the concept of a free market is contrasted with the concept of a coordinated market in fields of study such as political economy, new institutional economics, economic sociology, and political science.

If you think you know economics better than me, please point me to a source that says a 'free market' - even an idealised one - with always eventually reach the correct decision. Price is not a decision (in a free market) it is the outcome of demand and supply forces. 

The correct answer is a relative and subjective term - so your whole theory is based on falsity, not to mention that a truly free market does not exist in real world economics. 

[The wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) entry makes no such claim about a free market always arriving at the correct decision, and i would be interested to read any source that says otherwise.

Not to mention that my whole objection to the narrative being pushed is that the SBI decision may end up not being the correct decision. You have no way of telling. If may well end up being one of the incorrect decisions that gets improved upon, on the way to the 'correct' decision.

*Maybe* it will confirm eventually. At what fee level does a coffee payment become uneconomical? 5 cents? Are you telling me that such a transaction made today is likely to confirm eventually rather than time out of the mempool? But even if that is the case *today*, that can't always be true.

"Undergraduate physics degree here. It's word-play based on a shifting definition of ""equivalent"" for the two models. By Galilean relativity it is in fact true that you could say either that the Earth moves around the Sun, or the Sun moves around the Earth. Both are totally valid viewpoints. You can construct a perfectly valid theory of motion assuming that the Earth is stationary and all celestial bodies move relative to it. What you get is a rather complicated mess of orbital mechanics that are very hard to describe compactly. Google ""epicycles"" sometime.

What Johannes Kepler showed, using Tycho Brahe's observational data, was that IF you set the center of your coordinate system correctly, the description of planetary motion became ridiculously simple: rather than infinite cycles upon cycles of motion, any given planet moved in a ellipse -- incredibly simple introductory geometry known since Apollonius of Perga in the 2nd century BCE. Not long after, Isaac Newton provided the answer for why this type of motion is observed, with his formulation of the universal law of gravitation.

But even so this doesn't MANDATE that you center your thinking at the focus of motion near the Sun. The math just becomes easier that way, because instead of an infinite sequence of corrective factors, you can just use the simple equations of an ellipse. Scientists have a philosophical tool called Occam's razor, although the most succinct formulation goes back 1,500 further than William of Ockham to Aristotle: ""Nature operates in the shortest way possible."" This is claiming that the simplest right explanation IS the correct one.

However we must be very careful about how we interpret this, as it is in this case a statement of preference, not fact. The more complex solution is NOT wrong, per se. If you can describe the motion of the planets relative to the Earth using some complicated infinite sequence of epicycles or whatever, and if the predictions of this model match observation, then it is a perfectly valid model and just as correct as the heliocentric ellipse view. However as scientists we prefer the simpler explanations because (1) they are easier to work with; (2) they typically offer more explanatory insight; and (3) they often serve as better foundations for the next generation of theories.

So: by relativity it is true that you can say the Earth is stationary and that everything in the universe revolves around it. You can build a valid physical theory on that basis -- if you are a masochist, or if you don't plan on calculation any predictions anyway. The rest of us instead choose to model the Earth, Moon, Sun, planets, comets, stars, and galaxies as gravitational point masses or collections of masses, and apply Newton's 1/r^2 law of gravitation, because that's frankly a lot easier. And sometimes we get sloppy and say it's the *correct* model of the universe, which would seem to imply that the other, harder way is somehow incorrect, whereas it is in fact definitionally equivalent if it yields the same predictions.

Apparently some fundamentalist religious people find it easier to claim to work with ridiculously complicated mathematical perversions that place Earth at the center of the universe while still yielding the same results -- in theory, as I doubt anyone actually does this -- just to preserve the literal accuracy of a book that was probably fabricated in the 6th century BCE from the combined oral traditions of priestly and aristocratic families for political reasons.

">just as bad

Except there is a tonne of proof for geocentricity. First of all, if relativity is true (as is currently scientifically accepted), then we can think of the Earth being motionless and everything spinning around us and it is just as valid. If it is bad to look at the universe in a geocentric way, as you say it is, then it is equally bad to say it is heliocentric (if you believe relativity is true).

>""Either CS [coordinate system] could be used with equal justification. The two sentences: ""the sun is at rest and the earth moves,"" or ""the sun moves and the earth is at rest,"" would simply mean two different conventions concerning two different CSs.""

- Albert Einstein

>""We know that the difference between a heliocentric theory and geocentric theory is one of relative motion only, and that such a difference has no physical significance.""

- Fred Hoyle

>""Obviously it matters little if we think of the earth as turning about on its axis, or if we view it at rest while the fixed stars revolve around it. Geometrically these are exactly the same case of a relative rotation of the earth and the fixed stars with respect to one another.""

- Ernst Mach

One excellent proof that geocentricity is a more suitable view is [Airy's Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87M2i61N1cU). This experiment studied the aberration of starlight and proved that the apparent movement of stars is due to the movement of starlight (and thus the stars) rather than the movement of the observer (and thus the Earth). Another excellent proof is the cosmic microwave background radiation datasets - there is a great documentary that goes into this at length called The Principle but in a nutshell, the cosmos were found to be aligned to Earth's ""axis of evil"". That documentary features several prominent scientists, one of whom worked on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which also showed that all galaxies are placed at set distances from Earth, as if on concentric shells separated by 250 million light years. Might also be worth mentioning that the Big Bang Theory was debunked by a guy named [Halton Arp](http://electric-cosmos.org/arp.htm) but instead of having his research accepted, he was ostracized and had his telescope time taken away, forcing him to go to Europe to continue working.

There's a lot more to it and I don't want to type out an essay but that documentary is a good start into the vast amount of evidence for geocentricity. I didn't know Luke Jr believes this but the fact that he does doesn't tell me he is batshit crazy but rather he is a critical thinker, he is skeptical of what he is told.

"First of all, since you speak of relativity so much, I have to confirm. You do realize that relativity works with regard to a frame of reference, right? One frame of reference is the earth is stationary, and everything moves around it. The other frame is its inverse.

The clock thing in the video you linked, if you take the earth as the frame of reference, it's the rocket's time that is off. If you take the rocket as your frame of reference, it's the earth's time that is off. I don't see a problem here. Consider this,

> According to the theory of relativity, time dilation is a difference in the elapsed time measured by two observers, either due to a velocity difference relative to each other, or by being differently situated relative to a gravitational field. As a result of the nature of spacetime,[2] a clock that is moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer's own frame of reference. A clock that is under the influence of a stronger gravitational field than an observer's will also be measured to tick slower than the observer's own clock.

That was from wikipedia. **velocity difference relative to each other, or by being differently situated relative to a gravitational field...** The video says that relativity does not take into account acceleration. How else can there be a velocity difference, without acceleration?  In the rocket and earth problem, you have to consider which object is leaving which other object's gravity well. The masses of the two objects matter here.

"**Luminiferous aether**

In the late 19th century, luminiferous aether, aether, or ether, meaning light-bearing aether, was the postulated medium for the propagation of light. It was invoked to explain the ability of the apparently wave-based light to propagate through empty space, something that waves should not be able to do. The assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light.

The concept was the topic of considerable debate throughout its history, as it required the existence of an invisible and infinite material with no interaction with physical objects.

See, if the rocket was moving away from Earth, time would move slower for the rocket meaning it's relatively faster on Earth. If the Earth was moving away from the rocket, time on Earth would move slower and it would be relatively faster on the rocket. This destroys relativity because **it can't be both** (but according to relativity, it IS both).

"**Twin paradox**

In physics, the twin paradox is a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, according to an incorrect and naive application of time dilation and the principle of relativity, each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different inertial frames, one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey, and so there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins. Therefore, the twin paradox is not a paradox in the sense of a logical contradiction.

This is literally the same as the clocks. The space twin finds that the earth twin has aged more. but according to relativity, the space twin must have aged more, since the earth is moving and the rocket is still. PARADOX!

c'mon, you're the one proposing Airy's failure here. I did my research, and found that for the theory to work it needs the aether.

Scientists who go against the narrative are ostracized and their papers do not get peer-reviewed or published in journals.

You gave me an answer and that is not a cop-out, but here's the thing: if you consider the rocket being still and the Earth moving away from the rocket and back towards the rocket, the man on the rocket would be the older one. According to relativity, we can look at it both ways, so how could either one be older than the other? How would the one on Earth be older? There is no math required, relativity can be debunked without math.

>The NY Times says that Arp was demolished in the debate

Mainstream media also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and Osama did 9/11. Mainstream sources have a bias.

>It is strange how nobody talks about him and his research..

Not all that strange when you start seeing how much they are wrong about. I would go so far as to say it is an actual deception. What they do isn't real science. There are scientists who have started going their own route apart from the core group because the mainstream scientists are so obviously corrupted and biased, unable to let go of their older faulty theories.

In case you didn't see it, I linked to [this webpage](http://electric-cosmos.org/arp.htm) that gives a quick summary of what Arp discovered. Also, there is an excellent YouTube channel called ""ThunderboltsProject"" - the dude who runs the channel is very knowledgeable and he does an excellent job of pointing out all the faults with the accepted narrative as well as offering alternative theories.

I provided a lot of evidence (which you couldn't debunk), and you give me this empty statement which ultimately proves nothing. It is possible for a large group of people to be wrong. There are reasons the majority of scientists agree that the universe isn't geocentric, for example: many scientists have careers built on the work of Einstein, so no one dares criticize his theories; scientists don't want to deviate too far from the accepted narrative in fear of being ostracized (look at what happened to Halton Arp, as I mentioned in my big comment); and a lot of scientists haven't been exposed to the proofs I brought up - like I said, they aren't taught in school.

The Tychonic system (or Tychonian system) is a model of the Solar system published by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century which combines what he saw as the mathematical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical and ""physical"" benefits of the Ptolemaic system. The model may have been inspired by Valentin Naboth and Paul Wittich, a Silesian mathematician and astronomer. A similar yet mathematically more efficient geoheliocentric model was also proposed a century earlier by Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

It is conceptually a geocentric model: the Earth is at the center of the universe, the Sun and Moon and the stars revolve around the Earth, and the other five planets revolve around the Sun.

"It's asymmetrical because the force that caused the acceleration was only imparted on one of the parties. Someone on Earth can notice that the relative velocity between them and the rocket has changed and deduce that acceleration has occurred, but we know that the cause of the acceleration was the rocket engine. Relativity doesn't allow you to imagine the Earth fired its engines instead. 

You can imagine that the rocket firing pushed on the fabric of reality and dragged the Earth closer instead of pushing the rocket closer to the Earth, but the force still only occured in once place and not both places. The fact that force acted on one reference frame and not the other means that even with relativity, their experiences were different and the respective outcomes will therefore also be different.

"Has he been banned from /r/bitcoin yet?

It's clear to me that /r/bitcoin is doing whatever it takes to increase the value of bitcoin.

And Bitcoin cash is doing whatever it takes to make Bitcoin cash a viable currency.

In the end, both will survive, with different purposes.

But Bitcoin as an investment kind of scares me.  There is NOTHING backing it in any way.  If you own stock, at least the company has a revenue stream and usually pays you a dividend of some kind.  Same with corporate bonds.  And government securities are backed by tax dollars.  Bitcoin is 100% backed by faith.  It's more prone to a huge bubble burst than any other investment.  And if you lose a ton of money on Bitcoin. you can't even declare the loss on your taxes.  Definitely shaky ground for investment.  I wish them all the luck in the world.

Now with Bitcoin Cash actually trying to be currency, it has one major advantage.  If any commodity decides to use Bitcoin for it's buying and selling (oil, wheat, etc.) that will help stabilize the price and legitimize it as a currency.  Heck even in BCH becomes the preferred currency for ""illegal"" activities such as prostitution, then that will also help legitimize it as a currency.";1;0;False;plazman30;dr1dq1g;Official Endorsement: Luke (core dev) prefers BCH over LTC for exchange;7iq51j;https://i.redd.it/7av4xf7taz201.jpg

"**Embrace, extend, and extinguish**

""Embrace, extend, and extinguish"", also known as ""Embrace, extend, and exterminate"", is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found was used internally by Microsoft to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to disadvantage its competitors.

"> Gonna love it when you keep pretending it never happened

Again, really not sure what exactly you're saying here. xThin had been implemented and working and **bettering the network**  for more than a year (heck, before CompactBlocks even came to the party, and in fact it spurred Core to get their asses moving towards innovating towards better on-chain scalability; something that, as any thinking person should have concluded years ago, they've been intentionally delaying on) without it having any issues, until some Core fanboys found a bug, and attacked such nodes when a succesful HF seemed inevitable. 

Regardless, again, I'm not sure what a bug on a piece of software that didn't relate at all to consensus rules has **anything** to do with anything regarding the scalability debate; or indeed what makes you so smug in believing you're crushing it in this imaginary ""debate"" you're having in your mind, when what we're asking is for technical details to defend the notion that small blocks ""is the best way forward"", or, indeed, why on earth anyone believes **from a motherfucking technical standpoint** that on-chain scalability is impossible, let alone at blocksizes of **2MB**.

Bringing up embarrasing moments from the Core war campaign, especially one they want to desperately forget, isn't really any kind of technical argument at all.

I'm pretty sure that Shapeshift will attempt a direct exchange, and if it doesn't have a match it will then attempt an intermediary coin (BTC first). If you try to exchange an altcoin and there's no direct demand for the inverse trade, Shapeshift would have to find a middle man coin, and BTC would be the one that is most likely to fill the order.;1;0;False;chernobyl169;dr0u5bu;"Roger Ver on Twitter: ""Erik, the Bitcoin that you and I fell in love with in 2011, the one offering instant and basically free transactions for all of human kind along with a community that actually supports free speech is alive and well in the form of #BitcoinCash.
