It’s pretty fast and cheap txn-wise and could have a decent future but the way this sub and Ver represent it just turns so many off and is why so many have grown to mocking it.

Bullshit. Bitcoin.com lies and manipulates. Coincall is doing the opposite, preventing people from being scammed by the likes of Roger.

"I’m with you, trust me.  Can’t stand the arrogant and immature troll labeling.  It’s quite bizarre to be honest. Sadly, social media and the internet creates a platform for this to flourish.  Humans find comfort in the masses and so we latch onto an idea or opposition to an idea, and quickly get blinded to the truth... which is that nothing is black and white and simple two sided argument.   Same thing with politics.  Many of the same tactics conservatives use to generalize liberals are found in this lovely crypto debate.    The worst part is it’s near impossible to debate or argue with any hope of influencing, teaching or even learning from others, as stubborness and name calling fuels the majority to focus on the wrong things.

It’s sad where civilization is headed.  I wish we could just admit and embrace that we dont have all the answers ..  the more we listen and question our own beliefs, the faster we will progress in any meaningful way.  

Clearly satoshi didn’t have all the answers.  He had amazing solutions and glimpses into the future state, many of which have shown to be true.  But just like anything in this world, there is no one right way to do anything .  And no single person or book or creed or religion should ever be followed without frequent checks and revisions and adaptations and pause as we learn and eventually become smarter than the original idea and creator.   Unfortunately, we are not very good at stepping in another’s shoes and fully understanding  life from a different perspective.  We aren’t good with conflict.  Instead of listening, we demand others to listen to us, or resort to stereotyping and labeling.   

Glad to be living in such exciting times.  This isn’t about being right or wrong or right to a name.  No one is entitled to shit.  Let’s have many coins.   Spending every waking minute comparing bch to bitcoin is absurd.  The internet can make insignificant events feel much more important than they are.  And this is one of them.  No one gives a shit about bch being the real bitcoin.   No one is losing sleep over the atrocities this evil group called core has committed.    If anything, the world will never know of this so called crisis, and let’s hope so!

This just comes across as desperate and petty to most in the space. BCH doesn’t need the bitcoin name to succeed but trying to force on ppl when it’s clear they want no part of it and acting petty and childish to anyone who opposes the sentiment will only further the distance between the masses and this community. Develop the tech, make waves on ur own merits with ur own name and that will garner more respect. But this whole debate is only important to the BCH crowd and appears petty and childish to the rest of the world, which is why many outside of this sub mock BCH and call it a shit coin. Not because it’s necessarily true but because how the community acts. ;0;0;False;DeepFriedOprah;dyeq1b2;"coincall.io labels BCH a ""shitcoin""";8gpxhk;https://i.redd.it/nhbs5gwjumv01.png

Sure but that’s semantics.

"Are you guys concerned about individuals who are running their own nodes?

32 MB over ten minutes. Catching up on all those blocks can take a very long time for people with bad internet.

Plus having to maintain a large enough hard drive or hard drives (in plural) after a few years I would imagine.

This would really be a big pushback for people to run their own nodes
