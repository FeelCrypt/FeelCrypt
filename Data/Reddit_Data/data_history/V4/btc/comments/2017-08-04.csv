"I'm thinking more like the Clone Wars in the Star Wars triology.  There war is apparently between Palpatine (the chancellor of the republic) and Count Dooku (the funder of the separatists) - in reality Dooku is the servant of Palpatine, and there wouldn't be any war if it wasn't for Palpatine and Dooku deliberately pitching the sides against each other.  Who knows, maybe there is one person or agency deliberately pitching the sides against each other?

I don't know much about US politics ... but there is at least one striking resemblance - there is far too much ad-hominem and too much focus on the negative things in the debate.  As for the Bitcoin schism, my opinion is that most bitcoiners want the same: a healthy and thriving bitcoin ecosystem - on the question ""how is it best to get there"", the biggest issue is really whom to trust - and hence all the mud slinging.

In the US presidental election, any third candidate has no chance, everyone knows it's a waste of voting power to vote for a third candidate.  I may be very wrong about it, but my impression is that in the last election, a majority of the voters would have voted ""none of those two candidates"" if that would have been an option - must voters voted to avoid the worst of the two candidates to become president.  In such an environment it may be mudslinging and ad-hominem can be the best tactic for collecting votes.

If it would have been a more fair election with many candidates and the winner being chosen i.e. by a [runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system), some [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) or similar, then it would have been more profitable for the candidate to explain and argue for his political visions rather than to bash the opponents.

Perhaps Bitcoin has been victim of the same.  It is my impression that in 2015 there was very few (possibly except Todd and Luke) that was outright opposing the idea of raising the block size limit.  It was the natural way for Bitcoin to go.  BIP-100 was supported by a majority of miners.  In retro perspective, we'd probably have 2 MB or 8 MB blocks a year ago if the XT/BIP-101-clan would have dropped their proposal and supported BIP-100.  It's a bit ironic that the arguments used by the XT folks against BIP-100 was that it would give too much control to the miners.  Today it's the small blockers who don't want to give too much control to the miners ...

(Arguably back then - when the full block had to be relayed over the network before competing miners could start mining on the next block - even 1 MB was actually a bit too large).

"What SegWit does, is just move the witness data from the transaction section of the block, to it's own section. The reasons for this are: 

* So we can validate the witness data, by putting a hash in the header (we can't currently)
* So we can give the witness data a lower weight in the block size, because it's deleted anyway

The bandwidth will be the same as a regular block size increase, and the storage will be more efficient. This also fixes transaction malleability. There's really no reason not to implement SegWit.

"**Two-round system**

The two-round system (also known as the second ballot, runoff voting or ballotage) is a voting method used to elect a single winner, where the voter casts a single vote for their chosen candidate. However, if no candidate receives the required number of votes, then those candidates having less than a certain proportion of the votes, or all but the two candidates receiving the most votes, are eliminated, and a second round of voting is held.

The two-round system is used around the world for the election of legislative bodies and directly elected presidents. For example, it is used in French presidential, legislative, and departmental elections.

***

**Condorcet method**

A Condorcet method (English: ) is any election method that elects the candidate that would win a majority of the vote in all of the head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property is called the Condorcet winner. Voting methods that always elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists, satisfy the Condorcet criterion.

A Condorcet winner does not always exist in every election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can be cyclic—that is, for each candidate it might be possible to select an opponent where the opponent would win a majority of the votes.

"I almost found it funny, except for the fact that it's attempting to make both subs seem equal, which they very much are not. It's attempting to use humor to covertly equalize the subs. Very clever technique actually.

Some of those points are generated lies by r/bitcoin. Two specific examples:

* There are no paid shills from r/btc. I would put money on it being the case for r/bitcoin.

* Roger is not evil. He has helped Bitcoin adoption more than anyone I know in the bitcoin space. He seems generally good-natured.

* Jihan Wu is a miner. He does his job. He is also a good person. There have been lies spread about both Roger and Jihan, again emanating from r/bitcoin.

It's not a double-edged sword despite this attempt to make it seem that way.

To me this chart is an attempt to blur some valid wrongnesses and make them seem ok. And also a further method to spread lies.

"> But one of the biggest issues I have with segwit is the way it's implemented. Segwit starts off by assuming that hard-forking Bitcoin is impossible. The claim is just that it's ""too hard"" or ""impractical,"" but these claims aren't generally backed up. Segwit therefore bends over backwards to implement itself as a soft-fork, which means that old bitcoin wallets will still work, but won't understand the new features. But the astute reader will recall that segwit fundamentally alters the structure of blocks and transactions -- so how can this possibly be done as a soft-fork?

> The answer is that segwit uses what is, in my professional opinion, an unthinkably nasty hack: according to the Bitcoin protocol, all segwit transactions can be spent by anybody with no proof of authorization. That means that literally anyone can make a transaction that spends the bitcoins in a segwit address. The ""witness data"" (which is the rules for who's allowed to claim the outputs, and the proof that the rules were followed on the inputs that claim the outputs) is moved out of the main block and replaced with a simple ""anyone can spend me, there are no rules and no proofs,"" and it's up to miners to know what the rules really are, ignore the ""anyone can spend me"" instruction, and instead apply the rules from the witness data.

> There are two major implications to this hack. The first is that segwit is a one-way ticket: once it starts, it can never be removed because to remove the (insanely complicated) segwit rules that say ""Ignore what the transaction says and look at the witness data instead"" would leave only the ""anyone can spend me without any authorization"" rule on all segwit balances. Thus anyone could steal all the coins in segwit balances. To remove segwit, it would either be necessary to keep the (insanely complicated) rules in play, but disallow new transactions to use them, or convince all Bitcoin users to first move their bitcoins to a non-segwit balance. The first isn't really removing segwit, since its rules would still be in use, and the second is simply not going to happen since segwit proponents will lie and censor (just like they're doing now to promote segwit) to scare people away from leaving it behind.

> The second implication is even more chilling: for the first time, the Bitcoin protocol will have official support for theft of bitcoins. See, the formal rules of bitcoin will be ""anyone can spend these coins without authorization,"" but the segwit rules will say otherwise. This means that anyone who can get a majority of miners to agree to look the other way (i.e. ignore the segwit rules) can send a transaction that spends those bitcoins without authorization, and it will be valid by protocol. At present, if the majority of miners attempted to do this, their blocks would be invalid (and ignored by the network) because they violate the Bitcoin protocol, but with segwit, the Bitcoin protocol will only understand ""anyone can spend these coins"" so as long as the miners agree to ignore the segwit rules, the transaction will pass checks. Obviously this means that the miners could collude to steal everyone's segwit balances, but more likely, a government could force mining organizations to allow their transactions to steal bitcoins, reverse transactions, or whatever else. Whereas previously this meddling would've been extremely noisy, causing a hard fork (which would have likely been ignored). With segwit, however, theft by miner collusion is a first class feature.

"My biggest frustration in this debate is that many build arguments against Segwit that are seemingly based on looking at the network from only the perspective of a legacy node that is not Segwit capable and refuses to upgrade. 

It's this forced narrow perspective that leads them to make weird claims involving the ""main chain"" or ""main block"" that actually refer to to the ""stripped block"" served up to the single digit % of nodes which are not Segwit capable, and build hypothesis that ignore the other +90% of network nodes, the existence of honest miners running Segwit software, etc... 


>The ""witness data"" (which is the rules for who's allowed to claim the outputs, and the proof that the rules were followed on the inputs that claim the outputs) is moved out of the main block and replaced with a simple ""anyone can spend me, there are no rules and no proofs,"" and it's up to miners to know what the rules really are, ignore the ""anyone can spend me"" instruction, and instead apply the rules from the witness data.

In reality the signature data is still in the main block / chain, clearly visible in the raw hex data as a part of each transaction. There is no separate ""extension block"" structure that holds only signature data.

Miners receive whole transactions and blocks, they don't interact with the ""stripped blocks"" nodes create and serve up to fool legacy non-mining nodes. 



>This means that anyone who can get a majority of miners to agree to look the other way (i.e. ignore the segwit rules) can send a transaction that spends those bitcoins without authorization, and it will be valid by protocol. At present, if the majority of miners attempted to do this, their blocks would be invalid (and ignored by the network) because they violate the Bitcoin protocol, but with segwit, the Bitcoin protocol will only understand ""anyone can spend these coins"" so as long as the miners agree to ignore the segwit rules, the transaction will pass checks

And of course, this hypothesis ignores the fact that every single 0.13.1 and newer node will immediately reject such transactions & any blocks / chain that contain them as invalid. 

Miners running Segwit-compatible software will ignore the blocks and continue working on the valid chain which the nodes will follow, since they are incapable of following the thieving chain. 

To actually spend ""anyone can spend"" coins without authorization results in a hard fork of the chain, one that all Segwit software is entirely incapable of following regardless of chain length. 

The attack is near meaningless unless the community switches client software to follow the thief's forked chain and accepts it as Bitcoin, and businesses & exchanges will never adopt a chain fork whose primary goal is to steal people's coins.

Actually, it isn't. It's only the majority of what YOU have to deal with, for the exact reason that your job is to deal with those people.

That's classic confirmation bias.  A minority of people will be careless, and yes someone will have to deal with that, but any technology has growing pains.

> It's a big barrier to mainstream adoption. I know many don't care about mainstream adoption, but I do.

I think a lot of people care about mainstream adoption. Do you know what else is a big barrier? Having a tiny amount of transaction space and skyrocketing transaction fees.  Sure this fork has created some problems, but it's an attempt to solve some others in the process (it wasn't done for no reason) - and the problems it's creating (some labelling confusion, in a community that is already highly engaged and adaptable to be using such a fringe and unwieldy technology in the first place) are far smaller than the ones its solving (transaction capacity, social conventions around hard forks).

Don't dismiss everyone else as not caring for Bitcoin when really they just have their priorities of how to go about growing it determined differently.

Well, they have two different names, for starters.  Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that Coinbase will do anything other than allow only customers who held Bitcoin during the fork to be able to continuing storing their BCC with Coinbase or withdrawal their BCC.  Nothing in the statement suggests that Coinbase will feature BCC, allow buying and selling of BCC, or if display it to customers that did not have BTC during the fork.;1;0;False;blah6700;dl50yi5;Coinbase to add support for Bitcoin Cash by January 1, 2018 - Funding customer wallets with the BCH they had at the fork;6rflyb;https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf
"I don't get the vitriol. They said *days* before the split was to happen that they won't support it. 

I only had a few mBTC but it was ample time for me to transfer it to a diff exchange (one that credited BCH in a few hours).

It's quite obvious that they want to see the BCH crashing out of existence. Even that move of theirs was/is calculated in the sense that they create the circumstances of a cautious market.

I can't see how any lawsuit can stand against them. If anything they over-delivered (they didn't have to release the funds not in 5 months, not ever, legally speaking, given how much time they gave to their customers to take their funds away).

As for BCH supporters it's quite obvious that Coinbase is not for you, what the heck are you doing there.

What takes 5 months is that they're one of the only exchanges that has all their cold storage coins insured.  But you can bet that the only way they managed to get insurance was to promise that they stay cold, and pretty obviously the safest way to claim Bitcoin cash requires that they move all their cold stored coins to avoid replay risks.  If they don't want to move their cold stored coins then they need to analyze the Bitcoin Cash client they're using to ensure that there's no risk of either getting their keys stolen or any bugs that may cause replay risk (i.e. the transactions must always be in the new format);12;0;False;tekdemon;dl54lph;Coinbase to add support for Bitcoin Cash by January 1, 2018 - Funding customer wallets with the BCH they had at the fork;6rflyb;https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf

"I think you’re over complicating this (the processing time part). This is a software problem. There’s no reason why the client needs to download the blocks one by one, it could very easily download large batches and run multiple verification threads in parallel, and then stitch them together. At some points I was downloading at over 10%/hour, and at that pace I would be done in less than half a day, and even then I was barely using half my bandwidth.

People and companies who desire could run nodes with a standardized (BIP’ed) service that provides large amounts of blocks at once. You’d still verify the blocks, but you wouldn’t have to wait for them to be downloaded one by one.

I guess the cause of my slowdown were two: few nodes in the network (forcing me to download from a handful of nodes at a time), and stagnated scale development (old code which was more suitable for a much smaller blockchain).

Now the storage part, that’s less of a software problem and more of a technology problem. However, I was able to compress some block files and save 30% in space. Since we know which file contains each bunch of blocks, nothing stops the software from compressing the files as much as possible, and then unpacking them when a verification is needed.
