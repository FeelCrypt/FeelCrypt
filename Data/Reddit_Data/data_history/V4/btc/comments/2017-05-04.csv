So lets, once again, for the umpteenth time, make it a rational and sane argument:

> Where in the Whitepaper does it say that there should be 21 million bitcoins? Lets change it to 42 million!

In the whitepaper, on page 4 (though Cobra might have edited that out in your edition), it is written:

> Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.

The exact value, whether it is 21mio coins, or 42mio coins, or *whatever*, **does not matter**.

What matters is that it is a predetermined amount, thus fixed since Bitcoin's beginning.

And, yes, go ahead and *try* to change the 21mio coin limit, if that's your think. All other people will ignore you or other crazies for attempting this.

"Right. However...

1) Because of the capacity limit, average fees required to make it into a block have gone up what, like 300% or more in the past 6 months? Even more if you factor in the price increases. There is no good justification for this when the block reward is 12.5 BTC and we are sitting at all time high prices per coin.

2) The block reward does not need to be entirely replaced by fees for at least the next 7 - 10 years, maybe more especially if the price keeps going up. Why now when the industry is just barely starting to mature?

3) A restrictive capacity limit is not necessary whatsoever to allow fees to eventually replace the subsidy. This can and will happen naturally as the network grows. The easiest way to replace the subsidy is to process more transactions. More volume = more BTC earned. Profiting off of volume is literally one of *the* most basic ideas in business. 

4) The idea that nobody will bother to pay fees if there is excess capacity makes no sense at all. If that were the case, why have users had no problem paying fees for the past 8 years when blocks weren't full?

You can't just ""negligible away"" a cost. US dollar inflation is like 2%, which is by approximation zero, right? That absolutely does not work, in any way, and that is absolutely unacceptable math.

"Afaik 500kb was a soft limit.

"Interesting to see another thread on a similar post to my own [Here - 1mb tx Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68d4r1/1mb_txn_update/?st=j29qhzye&sh=1ece6077) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6747e2/1mb_fork_txn/?st=j23ahmns&sh=194320b7)

In my two posts, I believe those that participated in the discussion concluded this approach won't split the chain, unless there are irrational miners and a flag mechanism.  Here's why:

- Assuming less than 51% of the hash power sees the >1mb chain as valid, the small block chain with 51% will eventually create a longer chain that all nodes will see as valid, and the >1mb chain will be orphaned.

- No bounty should be required to fork the chain.  If there was a clear economic incentive to create larger blocks, miners would already be doing this, since the new chain would be more valuable to the market.

So in order for this to work, at least two things need to happen:

- Miners need to run a customized node that doesn't revert back to the small block chain, if the split does not have the majority of hash power.  This requires some type of flag.

- Miners that want to take an ideological stand, and risk the economic downside of this decision need to commit to mine the chain.  This is irrational for most miners.

"Miners alone wouldn't do it unless there was a good chance the community would follow, since even with half a million dollars up for grabs it won't be worth anything unless the rest of the commmunity is on board. However, it may give miners the boldness to do what is necessary to get the community in gear:

Schedule a block height at which the miner commits to publish at least one >1MB block, several weeks or months in the future, so that futures markets like those on BitMEX can begin trading on the value of the two resulting chains. The miner risks around $20,000 (at least) but has a chance to gain half a mil.

Another incentive would be to offer money (on both chains) just for mining a few >1MB blocks, even if the bigger-blocks chain goes fallow immediately. That way the miner would risk nothing. What this would achieve is it would allow for futures trading on the split, so that we could for the first time in history have a clear market indicator of the relative valuation the market would place on the Core path vs. the bigger blocks path. (Rather than the current situation where we can't know why the price is going up or whether it would go higher if we had Segwit or higher if we had bigger blocks.)

Even if bigger blocks lose in trading, that is still a great outcome, potentially, because it would show clearly that market likes Core's roadmap and thus the way forward for orice growth for now. However unlikely that scenario is, if it *did* happen (and there was good reason to believe the prediction market was operating correctly) I would be prepared to re-evaluate my stance on the debate, at least for the near term. 

Likewise, if the bigger-blocks chain wins in futures trading, the community will likely gear up for it and we will have it, with many small blockers similarly re-evaluating their stances. 

Either way we get resolution and a clearly market-backed path forward.";17;1;False;ForkiusMaximus;dh3z4ml;Save the Chain! Enclosed: 1 MB transaction with 273 BTC in fees;69318u;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/69318u/save_the_chain_enclosed_1_mb_transaction_with_273/
