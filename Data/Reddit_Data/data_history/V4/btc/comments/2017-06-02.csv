A maximalist is someone who believes that there is no need for any other currency besides Bitcoin.  You can see from my [prediction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=325284.0) years ago that the obvious economic effect of re-purposing Bitcoin as a settlement network to compete with (expensive) money-transfer services is to prop up other currencies, the US dollar especially.

AXA is an insurance company. They don't care about the block stream investment that much because it's likely they will get a multiple on their investment either way. If sidechains work they have a large position in a patented technology and they are set. If at the same time they made this investment they also bought $1 million in coins then if sidechains are dropped (or dropped for now) they just liquidate their coin position. It's not 0 risk but it's a pretty easy sell to investors looking to make a multiple.;-2;1;False;crookedkr;did1s0d;"Bitcoin-user complaints about 85$ transaction fee.

">AXA strategic ventures holds a controlling stake in Blockstream. I would suggest somebody inform them that the startup they sunk over $70m into

No. There is zero evidence whatsoever that the investment by AXA Strategic Ventures is a *controlling stake*. 

Hell, they weren't even a participant in the first public funding round! 


$70m is the **total** of the second public funding round (Spring 2016), and AXA SV was merely one of 9 companies to participate.

According to available public info, it was actually Horizons Ventures who led the second round, and who contributed someone to the board of directors.

But nobody cares about Horizons Ventures, because there's no juicy AXA - Bilderberg - Illuminati conspiracy. ";0;1;False;fury420;dida668;"Bitcoin-user complaints about 85$ transaction fee.
