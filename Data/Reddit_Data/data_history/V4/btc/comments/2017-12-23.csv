">Wait, Why though why are they attacking it?

That's a better question than you imagine.

If you believe in your product you don't need to be attacking the competition constantly. The fact that r/bitcoin supports Bitcoin Core but needs to be constantly attacking Bitcoin Cash is very telling.

>Also someone said it was a alt-coin on /r/bitcoin is it or?

Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are competing to be THE Bitcoin. They both share a common part of the same blockchain, as they split a few months ago to each go its way. Bitcoin Core got the initial recognition as Bitcoin from most exchanges, hence why some like to call Bitcoin Cash an altcoin, but Bitcoin Cash is putting up a fight and actually getting closer to Bitcoin Core market cap because, unlike Core, Cash actually has utility.";37;1;False;desderon;drobt32;"Tor Project: ""Due to the current state of the Bitcoin market, our payment processor, Bitpay, will not allow us to accept donations of less than 100 USD.

It only takes a while when sending it from an exchange. Exchanges are like banks, where they don't have everyone's money in stock at once. If everyone withdraws LTC at the same time, they don't have enough LTC for everyone.

To be honest though, I'm not entirely sure how the system is setup for LN nodes to actually make money or decide what kind of fee they are going to charge (I'll look this up though).

"LOL. I don't know what to say in reply except nice rant and it made me laugh without any negative judgement.

Indeed I say ""Bitcoin Cash"" *should* (obviously only in my opinion for whatever that is worth) have inherited the name Bitcoin simply because it adheres closest to the original Bitcoin code, whitepaper, intent and feature priority.  But I am not worked up about Core having the name.  It is just a name. :)

Personally I think Bitcoin (Core) is running off into the weeds, but I could be wrong and I wish both BTC and BCH well given they are each now optimizing for a different approach.  (And I own both.) As with other competitors, every team with a clear vision is an asset as this new area of digital currencies is explored.

I don't think either is a pyramid scheme, even though I have little regard for Core and believe they are manipulative and economically incoherent.  I think they are genuinely trying to create something useful, not milking anyone.  And Bitcoin Cash is also focused on being useful, at the efficient transaction level.

Of all the criticisms that could be made for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, I don't think either is a pyramid scheme.  (Although either or both could be or become over valued at some time simply because nobody really knows yet what they should be valued.)

"No, you don't understand how value is prescribed - it is done through consensus, and the consensus can be determined through a number of factors, possibly including (but not necessarily so) utility. They are not always linked.

Case and point, did you know that there is evidence of mountain folk from centuries ago, having used sea shells as currency? The scarcity of the sea shells drove the value upwards, creating a consensus among the community that they have value, despite having no actual utility, other than being something of value. Now, the mountain folk could horde the sea shells, and it would act a store of value. Along the same lines, art is also a store of value, despite having no utility. As is gold, and other precious metals which (despite its chemical composition making it useful for practical purposes) is used as a store of value, more than industrial/commercial practises.

By this same notion, BTC is a store of value.

NOW. You could argue that BTC isn't a great store of value, since the inability to appropriate transact it may drive down the price. However, the consensus among the investors and market at the moment, is that BTC is worth + $14,000. As such, it is still a good store of value.

It's very simple actually...

"**Shell money**

Shell money is a medium of exchange similar to coin money and other forms of commodity money, and was once commonly used in many parts of the world. Shell money usually consisted either of whole sea shells or pieces of them, which were often worked into beads or were otherwise artificially shaped. The use of shells in trade began as direct commodity exchange, the shells having value as body ornamentation. The distinction between beads as commodities and beads as money has been the subject of debate among economic anthropologists.

"A lot of accounts posting in /r\/Bitcoin are fake accounts created to give you the impression that masses are rising up to support high fees and slow transactions. These fake accounts up-vote one another and carry on extended fake conversations with one another.

That the above must be true can be easily confirmed. Simply talk to people in real life and see how many of them actively support high fees and slow transactions. The percentage will be very low. And yet, you see masses of people advocating exactly that in /r\/Bitcoin. These people cannot all be real.

Some of these fake accounts come to /r\/BTC and down-vote topics that they think should be prevented from becoming widely read.

Of course, in the real world, people have all sorts of extreme opinions. No doubt some of the people advocating high fees and slow transactions in /r\/Bitcoin are real. The majority must be fake, because out there in the real world hardly any non-Core non-Blockstream person prefers high fees and slow transactions.

"Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't have the 8mb cap, current hardcap is I believe 32mb, but there is no dev resistance to expanding that and they have done tests on [gigablocks](https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/) and feasibility studies on [terablocks](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html).  On top of that, work is being done on [subchains/""weak blocks""](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/subchains.pdf), which secure 0-conf transactions.

As other commenters mention, throughput matters more than confirmation times, because the acid test of any blockchain is transactions per second (assuming full blocks).  LTC offers 4x1mb blocks in 10 minutes, BCH offers (currently) up to 1x32mb blocks in 10 minutes, giving it 8x the throughput.  

The bottleneck is primarily in the weight of the blockchain itself, i.e. bootstrap time and storage space.  These are the constraints that make running a non-mining node more expensive, but things like sharding and decentralized storage can reduce that.  Alternatively, zero-knowledge proofs of validity could allow SPV clients to validate blocks, and/or make it possible to prune the Merkle tree arbitrarily with no loss of security.  If all else fails, there's always node incentivization, i.e. splitting a portion of mining rewards off to non-mining nodes that host a full copy of the blockchain.";1;0;False;;drn9fzt;I'm not a fan of Bitcoin Cash for the record, but good god is the /r/bitcoin subreddit fucking garbage;7lhie4;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lhie4/im_not_a_fan_of_bitcoin_cash_for_the_record_but/

">Actually, the reason BTC is called Bitcoin and BCH isn't is precisely because it has the longest accumulated difficulty. The **miners** have made this the case. *If* this changes in the future, BCH **will** be called Bitcoin.

Lol, you're delusional. Then how about the reverse, why aren't BCH users constantly confused with BTC transactions? Because  they rely on nodes to verify everything, even if those nodes are run by third parties. The two chains are incompatible, BCH even has replay protection, anyone running a node or relying on a trusted node will not confuse BTC with BCH, regardless of the hash rate. 

>Miners aren't forced, and neither are businesses. Bitcoin does not involve coercion.

That's what I've been saying this whole time. Miners can't force incompatible rules on the nodes and the people who rely on those nodes. 

>You cannot know that the block you have been given is valid. Ask yourself how you can check whether or not this block you have been given is valid.

We're going into looney territory now, of course you can check if a block is valid. It might be orphaned later but it's still valid. The risk of orphaning (or a double spend attack) is why you should wait for multiple blocks to be built on top of it before being reasonably sure that the transaction won't be rolled back. 

You can verify a block by verifying that it follows all the protocol rules (valid PoW with the correct difficulty, valid signatures on transactions, no transactions spending an already spent or inexistent output, etc). 

>Do you think only one university exists?

I'm pretty sure there wasn't some coordination between people with access to university GPU's to jump in all at once. One person had the opportunity to be the first and to double spend a few million Bitcoin, yet it didn't happen.

>There is a technical cost to doing so, which your fictional example ignores, which at the time was greater than the value of the reward for implementing it.

No, it doesn't ignore it, but the technical cost is pretty low for someone already used to working with GPU's in their research. They could increase the amount of the double spend up to the point that it became worth the effort. I claim this didn't happen because the coin was essentially worthless at the time and it would be nearly impossible to get a significant amount of dollars out of such an attack. 

>Yes, and those people do not negate the people that didn't lose their bitcoin, and believed in it enough to safeguard their private keys from the beginning.

When you find yourself attacking a person in this way, consider some self-reflection. What is the value of discussing things when we devolve from the Socratic method into ad hominems?

We will fundamentally disagree on this point. I believe in the subjective value theory. The value of coins at all times is fluctuating between individuals. For some people, the value was greater than for others. Certainly some people considered them worthless, but some considered them very valuable.

As for the rest of the arguments you make against the game theoretical components of bitcoin, I have nothing much to say.

"> And how is that working out for miners trying to sell Bitcoin Cash as if it was Bitcoin? Even if Bitcoin Cash becomes the chain with the most PoW, it won't matter, they won't be able to sell it as Bitcoin.

Actually, the reason BTC is called Bitcoin and BCH isn't is precisely because it has the longest accumulated difficulty. The **miners** have made this the case. *If* this changes in the future, BCH **will** be called Bitcoin. You may not like it, and you may refuse to acknowledge that, but the majority of hashing power has the final say.

> You call them impotent and yet they prevent miners from forcing businesses to follow rules they don't want and buying coins from the wrong chain.

Miners aren't forced, and neither are businesses. Bitcoin does not involve coercion. It is driven by incentives. Miners short term incentives are what drives their economic decisions. If you don't believe me, study carefully the hashpower duing the period of time between the August hard fork, (with the EDA) and the DAA upgrade.

I think we are in agreement here.

> How is it the exact same if one only needs one block to realize it's invalid and the other one needs to connect to everyone to make sure the block is valid?

You cannot know that the block you have been given is valid. Ask yourself how you can check whether or not this block you have been given is valid. What advantage do you have over SPV with arbitrary depth merkle tree proof audit?

I didn't ignore you. The dates you mention don't line up, but let's pretend they do, for arguments sake. Suppose you could conduct a 51% attack and steal the bitcoin from the pizza transaction. What have you succeeded in doing, really? Do you think only one university exists? The moment you make this jump to GPUs, so can everyone else. There is a technical cost to doing so, which your fictional example ignores, which at the time was greater than the value of the reward for implementing it.

You are correct, though, to point out that large transactions have a bigger risk of being reversed by a 51% attack. This is why extra confirmations are suggested. It becomes increasingly difficult to catch up on an alternate chain.

"We're only doing charities to nonprofits over individuals or making it rain for a couple of reasons:

1) Accountability and impact. When we donate to a registered nonprofit, we know that we are supporting an accountable organization, operating under strict legal frameworks. If we donate to individuals, we can't verify their claims, nor solve the Sybil problem of people making multiple accounts and pretending to be multiple people

2) Tax. We don't pay capital gains when we donate to registered nonprofits. All of the crypto can go to good causes, no coins going to the state, no tax worries for me :)

I did in fact get into BTC because of how revolutionary decentralized money was. I think the vision is alive in both BTC and BCH, with differing priorities but nevertheless still with transformative impacts.

"This was a CPFP payment for a number of transactions (300-400 satoshi per kb fee each, which apparently isn't enough to be confirmed for 4 days). So, the actual satoshi per byte, averaged out across all the unconfirmed inputs, was a few thousand satoshis / byte (don't remember which, and estimatefee.com's calculator doesn't work for confirmed TXes)

One issue I've previously encountered with CPFP is that some nodes will just start ignoring / not accepting transactions with a long chain of transactions. For example, Insight / BitPay never recognized transactions at the end of the chain. This means that I have to set the TX fee high enough to propagate across the network some nodes are missing the inputs and simply won't accept it.

I am glad to see that you are concerned about accountability. How much time have you spent checking the Form 990s of the 'not for profits' you are handing out these gigantic blank cheques to?

A little bird told me that one of the 'not for profits' you have given money to has an intriguing track record when it comes to distributing funds. This little bird told me that the 'not for profit' in question paid its founder/director ~70% of total revenues in a recent financial year.

Imagine that! A 'not for profit' which took 70 cents from every dollar donated and put it straight into the bank account of the person running the 'not for profit'!

Why, if this were true, it would be **scandalous**...

How amusingly naive.

We are talking about millions of dollars, here. If you don't think there are people out there who would misappropriate or otherwise take advantage of this kind of money, all in the name of 'charity', then you have some hard lessons in life ahead of you.

That is, the 'not for profit' gives more of its donations to its founder/director as PAY than it does to the charitable causes it supposedly exists to be helping.

Now, if our friend, Mr/Ms Pineapple, is doing his/her due diligence, then I am sure that my little bird must be wrong. No way would Mr/Ms Pineapple be giving blank cheques to 'not for profits' who engage in this kind of behavior.

"Are you not aware of some of the shady things that the so-called CEO of BCH has done in the past? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0 Why associate with this?

Are you also not aware of how suspicious you make yourself look when you suddenly choose BCH instead of any other altcoin that might not have the problems that BTC currently has? You should be fully aware that a move like this is a highly political move and it's almost as if this had to be intentional because you would have to be completely oblivious to believe this wouldn't have an effect like this.

Look at it this way... for all we know you could have planned this whole thing from the start not for the charity primarily but to manipulate the ongoing war between BTC and BCH, and the generous donations, while still being donations, are a means for media attention. Directly asking BitPay or Coinbase to support BCH because you are this special guy with 5k BTC, and you now want them to accept BCH out of everything that exists, is fishy. Why not LTC/DOGE/XMR/whatever? This whole thing might just be a huge BCH marketing campaign with a budget of 5 million of which 3 million have been spent on charity or something, since conventional marketing and other things that you can pay for haven't worked, but huge charities always grab some media attention.

PS: Why do you keep refering to yourself as a ""we"" in your type of writing and at the same time stress that it's a ""one person project"" where you don't want to waste time with network issues etc?

"No, at the time this transaction was made, calculating it exactly would be a **400** sat/Byte fee.

Overshooting for good measure to compensate for potential growth would have been a **600** sat/Byte.

Overkill would have been a **1,000** sat/byte fee.

This was **36,000** sat/byte. 36 ***thousand***.

600 would have guaranteed confirmation at that moment, even after accounting for a really fast rate of fee growth.

I think a lot more people will be coming to the same conclusion about Bitcoin's current utility that you have. Good that you've discovered this sooner than later! Being that BCH could help countless people in need of an inexpensive and accessible payment rail (Bitcoin's original promise), you might consider a donation to the [Bitcoin Cash Fund](https://thebitcoincash.fund/)? Also not sure if you've seen the recent news but both Bitpay and Coinbase are supporting Bitcoin Cash.

"I second the suggestion to donate to free software organizations such as the Free Software Foundation.

> Bitcoin as non-free software would have never happened.

True. I cannot believe how many people treat Bitcoin as a brand, as a trademark only one entity is welcome to use. This is one reason I don't understand why people dislike hard forks. Anyone can take the Bitcoin source code, adapt it to their needs, and call it anything they want. The markets, miners, and users will dictate which Bitcoin chain will dominate. This is why arguing about the ""real Bitcoin"" and accusing one another of stealing the ""Bitcoin brand"" are pointless acts; because Bitcoin is open-source. Think about it, do you hear anyone in the Linux community arguing over which is the ""real Linux kernel"" or even the ""real Linux distribution""?

"So, segwit seems to have gathered consensus, and then the blocksize increase did not. If the change was supposed to be for both, then why not do it all at the same time? Also, why spend a bunch of time working on segwit as a soft fork, only to do a hard fork right after?

Either way, I don't get the insistence on externalizing the cost to the users and node operators. I seriously doubt regular transactions are the causing the blocks to fill up. Clearly, exchanges and services are not optimizing anything, and they just push the cost to their customers. Most of them aren't using segwit and they aren't doing batching. You start giving in to an increase, they'll just ask for more and more, until nobody except them can run a node.

They tried. They open the book for post but weren't attracting much liquidity at all. After about 6 hours they closed it and said they will try again next month. In the wake of the flash spike they had with BCH/USD I'd be cautious too. They could either postpone or open with market orders disabled.

They had a flash spike about 3 minutes in because market orders cleared the sell side of the order book because there was very little liquidity and a couple orders for about $9.5k went through before they could pull the plug. After they pulled the plug the frozen market showed last sale price of $9.5k for about 12 hours until it was cleared so they could open the book for posting new orders and relaunch with sufficient liquidity. Trolls are repeating that by keeping the last sale price of BCH up rather than immediately hiding it that there was some conspiracy. I don't see it. Technically it WAS the last price before the market was frozen and some unlucky sap paid that (don't hit market buy in a high volatility market with shallow books people) and it's not like markets around the world rose to $9.5k for BCH just because of one frozen exchange. The price during those 12 hours was pretty normal. There was a rise from the announcement they would go live which plateaued to a price, they went live and broke and the price in other exchanges pretty much sat at the plateau. The world didn't start buying $9.5k BCH because the world isn't so stupid.;5;0;False;;drnm00g;Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.;7lirko;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lirko/reminder_blockstream_and_core_got_100_of/

"> simply because their scaling solution is about fitting more transactions in a single 1mb block rather than just raising the size of the block, AKA: being more efficient, not to mention I trust them much much more.

Care to explain how that works?  SegWit just uses some accounting tricks to 'fit more transactions' into a block. The data that is being transmitted can is equal or in some instances more than just increasing the block size. 
So, no it's not a more efficient way to process more transactions, it's a more complicated way to process more transactions. The only real upside that SegWit provides, is the ability to handle 2nd layer solutions such as the LN. Some of the same features which are already supported on BCH with the last hard fork.

I don't know if it would have made a difference but a fair argument is that gdax almost instantly froze trading and left their price showing 8k for 8+ hours. They came back and wouldn't allow people to trade it against btc and pegged the price to btc on coinbase meaning it couldn't significantly fall. They disallowed transferring bch out of gdax and coinbase and their exchange crashed a second time. Like I said I don't know if it hurt or helped but coinbase has not given their users to fully exercise their options and has limited the potential growth or loss of other exchanges by pegging the price. ;4;2;False;nitfut;drn5293;Reminder: Blockstream and Core got 100% of everything they asked for.;7lirko;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lirko/reminder_blockstream_and_core_got_100_of/

"One thing I find odd.

Monero, which I think is a good coin BTW, has had increasing fees also, but not because of some refusal to increase blocksize (they have adaptive blocksizes like sane people) but because their mixins take up a lot of space. Bulletproof transactions were a known way to decrease the size of the transaction by 80% while keeping the same security guarantees which brings their blocksize and fees back down to most other coins and is cool for everybody involved. They are nearly done and it is rolled out on their testnet and will likely go live with their next hard fork release.

And who, praytell did the implementation work on this really cool new tech in Monero? Blockstream. The salaried development team supposedly building lightning network and supporting Bitcoin Core but hasn't produced anything more substantial than a slightly different way to sign transactions for a minimal size decrease in 4 years of effort.

"Lol Ok, well, sorry you feel that way but it definitely took 1h for my transaction to confirm and cost me $10 so, I don't see how any of that is ""lies"", except for that it goes against your current opinion of things.

Custom fees, I'll keep that in mind, is there a place where I can see the current fees for Bitcoin Cash? Like bitcoinfees.earn.com? If I'm sending a transaction I want to know it's going to confirm, for the amount I was sending I had no problem spending $10, versus the current $100 on bitcoin.

All I'm saying is that it isn't THAT much better.

You can't blame me for not knowing this stuff is there's no where to read it other than in a sea of reddit posts. I definitely didn't want to pay a small amount then it take 3-4 hours for my Bitcoin Cash to confirm 10x so I can't spend it while its dropping like mad. Clearly there's something wrong with the way ledger is calculating fees.

Think of me as the ""average user"", custom fees get a little difficult and worrying about it kind of sucks since I'm used to not having to worry about it. In the end, shouldn't we be wanting more people to join the system? Shouldn't we be making it easier ?

"I don't think they took trading of BCH offline to investigate employees trading. Rather, they screwed up on their launch.

They didn't give enough notice for the launch so there was little awareness. There was about an hour or so allotted to fill up the order book with post-only limit orders. Then they hit launch. There wasn't a lot of orders on the book yet and there was a lot of upward pressure on BCH because just launching on Coinbase was likely to drive the price up. As the sell orders started to get bought up with the low liquidity the price started spiking hard. Seeing the spike there was a bunch of market orders made to buy at current price, but of course market order means ""buy at ANY price"", a distinction that REALLY becomes important when there is no liquidity. Prices instantly shot to $9500 when the order book completely cleared on the sell side before Coinbase was able to pull the plug.

They then, more reasonably, gave about 12 hours notice, an exact time when the order book would open for posting, and a conditional launch based on liquidity. About an hour and a half after opening the book they launched with sufficient liquidity and things were fine. They then tried it with EUR/BCH and BTC/BCH markets but after about 6 hours of the book being open for post there wasn't much liquidity there. So they announced they would try again next month rather than open the book with low liquidity and potentially face the same issues a second time.";1;1;False;;drnitqw;You guys where right the whole time.

In addition to the above... I think they are just salty that traders can now buy BCH as well and not just sell it into Bitcoin as was previously thought.

"The bot just scans comments for mentions of commands, and then credits that username with the tip. The user receiving the tip doesn't need to register anywhere before. 

It only works with BCH as BTC no longer works for small payments. You send the bot a message ""deposit"" and then it gives you your address to deposit to. Afterwards you can tip people. If you received a tip, you don't have to deposit of course, you can just pass it on to someone, or withdraw to your own BCH wallet.

Don't know what there is to scam. Though some people tend to create new accounts and then post something that encourages others to tip. If you mean that the bot won't just collect the money and disappear, then it's unlikely. The creator is well known in the community. Of course the bot has control over the funds until you withdraw, but it's meant for small amounts anyway.

"It always makes me feel extremely happy and smile when I see these posts on /r/btc. Before it was THIS common, it was originally making me feel better about my investment and that the market actually WILL support the better tech.

Now I'm happy to see so many people are actually getting on the right train and getting out of what is about to lose them their mortgage or even any funds they thought were safe without researching. It's sad that core shills are attacking google play reviews of certain wallets and people who don't understand this tech leaves terrible reviews for the wallet. But this is also ultimately caused by core, but they don't get the blame because obviously people dont understand and blame the wallet for stealing their funds.

I'm really happy when I see these posts because I know these people have swapped over in time before getting highly burned.

Someone at r/bitcoin posted they bought in at 19500 with their 100k mortgage and now it's down to 65k or something and everyone just keeps telling him to HODL. It's so sad and you obviously can't go there and say anything or you get banned.

Fun tip, someone posted a shill post here and first topic on their history was a topic they created saying they bought in at 19k. They said ""how does sucking vers dick taste"" and I replied with ""how does buying at 19500 feel?""

Fucking idiots, no offense to you because I'm talking about someone else, but how stupid do they have to be. They buy at the ATH of 19k and theyre down to 14k and decide to go to our thread and talk about us in a slanderous way, like tf.  And the best thing that team can come up with are rudamentaory insults and act as if we all love Roger which I'm sure isn't the case.

"> I don't believe in ON CHAIN SCALING because I know it isn't easy to scale on chain and that going for unlimited blocksize is just one of the dumbest shit someone can do

How can I answer that? You said you already ""know"". 

You also believe that spamming the BTC chain is easy if you have lots of BTC. Right, this is easy to answer. For ""spam"" to actually be effective it has to be mined into a block. Transactions with fees that are too low will just be dropped and cause zero congestion on the actual block chain.

So to ""spam"" the BTC network, lets say at least 25% of all transactions need to be this ""spam"". A BTC block holds on average 2000-3000 transactions, so lets say we want to have 500 transactions in every block to clog up the network. However, *average* fees per block are currently around $100,000 per block. That means to have have 25% of transactions be this ""spam"", it would cost $25000. That's $25000 per block. Six block per hour, 24 hours in a day means:

    $25000 * 6 * 24 = $3,600,000

Yes, it would cost $3.6 million per day to ""spam"" the BTC network. Nobody is that rich.

Ok, so you could say the ""spam"" transactions are paying less. Well [here is the block explorer](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks).  Go ahead and find me a single non-coinbase transactions that paid less than US$50 per kilobyte.

> How are they forcing it? By not increasing the block size?

Yes, by not increasing the block size the Core devs are creating an artificial scarcity (transactions space on the blockchain) which means that people are willing to pay more and more to get their transactions processed immediately.

The is no ""spam"", not on the BTC chain and not on the BCH chain. On the BCH chain, if a transaction pays a fee, its a transaction and not spam. Transactions without fees are not processed.

"Sorry to burst your bubble but you don't get to decide what is the ""true"" Bitcoin.

Can I load up my wallet from 1 year ago and use Bitcoin Cash? No? Wait what, I need to download a completely different software to use it in the first place? Congratulations, you're an Altcoin. This is simply an objective fact, your personal feelings don't matter and don't change this fact. I can keep using Bitcoin with SegWit just the same as I could use Bitcoin without SegWit a year ago, nothing has changed, SegWit wasn't even a Hard Fork.

Besides that, doesn't the Whitepaper which you guys treat as the Holy Bible claim that the chain with the most work is the real Bitcoin? Oh right... the Whitepaper only matters if you can bend and interpret it's content so that it supports your argument but not when it doesn't.

PS: I have both coins but it's manipulative, propaganda posts like these which drive people away from Bitcoin Cash. Stop using lies and manipulation, like for example the graph used in the recent tweet with CNBC which was objectively a wrong graph and misleading on purpose. Having Roger Ver claim LN will work better on Bitcoin Cash without touching on the fact that you need SegWit to use LN in the first place (aka dodging the question and manipulating feelings once again).

"For what it's worth, I was the same as you for quite some time.

The opposition towards Segwit2X was the breaking point for me though. I was always skeptical of Core's refusal to increase the blocksize, but when I watched how they pushed against that - and constantly shifted their narrative when all of their technical excuses were easily debunked - that's when I realized that it wasn't even difference of opinion. They seemed to be outright trying to destroy what Bitcoin was originally intended to do.

That said, I'm not against Lightning Network per se. I just don't think it'll work ""decentralized"" as touted. I was also under the belief that it would be ready as soon as Segwit was implemented. The fact that they're now claiming Bitcoin is intended as a ""store of value"" really boggles the brain too.

While I'm at it, I'd like to give a big sincere ""thank you"" to Roger Ver for continuing to do what he does, despite all the naive (and paid) slander that goes his way. I admire both his courage and passion.

"Welcome to the bright side!

> Fuck you BlockStream. Im literally dedicating all my spare time, to do whatever it takes to help bring you down.

Don't! I feel your anger but it can eat you up. 

Try to reclaim your power and transform this anger into something positive. There's a lot of power in this anger. You can pull that up to a higher level and use it in a positive way. How? Just feel that anger, let it be as big as it wants to be, go into it and feel it. Then expand your consciousness and connect with your higher self. Next proclaim ""I hereby reclaim my power"", then feel the difference. What has changed? This is an astonishingly effective technique.

Let's not fight core/blockstream, but instead I suggest to dedicate your energy to doing positive things in the Bitcoin Cash community. Educating other users that are still under mind control could be a noble thing for you to do: pass on what you received. Something as simple as pointing out the existence of r/btc and Bitcoin Cash to people around you who talk about Bitcoin can help a lot.

"I'm going to tell you something you don't like to hear.

Measuring block size, transaction costs and throughput is missing the point.

Trying to solve these issues directly is treating the symptom rather than the actual problem.

Satoshi's white paper, and hes original vision, did not differentiate between nodes and miners. He knew that the ledger had to be distributed and spread all over the world in order to be immutable, and the miners were the obvious candidates to take care of this.

Unfortunately, as mining has become centralized, and mining pools typically only run a single full node, the ledger is no longer distributed the way it has to be.
Increasing the block size doesn't solve this problem, it may even make it worse.

There is two ways to solve this, either mining has to become decentralized the way it once was, since miners are the only ones incentivised to keep a ledger running and synchronized at all times. Or, economic nodes has to be incentivised to do it instead.

Neither Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash has solved this issue.

As far as I can see, Bitcoin Cash has no solution to this issue.
Bitcoin Core on the other hand are going for the second option which is to incentivise economic nodes to keep the ledger distributed by making some of them into Lightning nodes.";3;2;False;NigelClutterbuck;drnqz61;You guys where right the whole time.

"My main concern with BCH is that mining appears to be close to 100% centralized, which opens the possibility of the miners spamming the network to jack up the fee's for BCH as well (just because the blocks are bigger doesn't mean they couldn't do it if there wasn't a big financial cost to do it). At the moment this isn't happening, and BCH's volume is a lot lower than Bitcoins. Ultimately, long term I think cores scaling solution is the only real solution to handle 10's of thousands of times the current volume reliably (BCH simply wouldn't be able to handle this amount of volume without segwit at the very least). It would also go a long way if exchanges were to start adopting segwit integration.

I think a lot of people are getting caught up in the 'low fees fast confirmations time' hype, but by that logic there are other coins even better than bcash, such as litecoin, vertcoin, ethereum to name a few. The segwit + LN scaling solution will work much better than big blocks, as it is not subject to possible miner attacks. I guess the problem is that right now Bitcoin is slow with high fee's, but you can't rush implementation of this... what if they decide to rush it through and mistakes are made costing people money?

They're conditioned to so blindly skirt around facts that they don't agree with that they never actually want to see the evidence, and this is where we need to show people the light.

"> That is what bitcoin is supposed to do. Not make us rich, but make us part of a larger more efficient network.

NGOs have realised for a while now that the way to truly, most efficiently, and  lastingly help the needy in the most impoverished countries, isn't by giving them food and clothes; it's by removing the barriers they have to developing their own economies, which then makes them create their own wealth. Currently due to different political situations, centralised hyperinflationary money control, etc; for many countries this is little more than a pipe-dream (or at least greatly obstaclised).

Bitcoin can potentially solve this and **immediately** allow them to reach, transact, earn, and trade in an international currency that's uncensorable, even if their dictator doesn't like it.

Tech saavy people in Venezuela had been using BTC for a few years now to echieve this (and I understand now they're switching to BCH); but mark my words, with what Maduro did by introducing his version of a centrally controlled ""cryptocurrency"", all he'll achieve is to educate the masses on all of these concepts, and of course people will understand that the non-government-sanctioned alternative is much preferable.

"A lot of users expected bch to go live on Jan 1 for sale only. It went live much earlier for sale and for purchase. The price spiked, and Coinbase stopped purchases and sales for it.

The price displayed as around 8k for bch for a while, then went back down to around 4k.

A lot of people (especially on the Bitcoin sub) were upset about it, and believe there was insider trading going on.

Coinbase is investigating.

There is so far no proof of this.

Personally: 

I'm a little upset at the surprise purchase option, because I would have bought A LOT on another exchange ASAP as soon as I knew it would go live on Coinbase for buy/sell.

"Not sure if the other answer was really what you were looking for.  If you're just asking about the last week, all Coinbase did was open up Bitcoin Cash as an option on their sites.  You can buy, sell, or trade BCH on Coinbase and GDAX now.  While they were at it, they also created BCH wallets for any of their users that had BTC on Coinbase during the fork, crediting the user for the appropriate amount of BCH.  

BCH was already on an upswing when they announced the other day.  This led some people to accuse Coinbase of ""insider trading.""  The quotes are because they're accused of buying BCH cheap on other markets, anticipating a rise in price once Coinbase went live, which is NOT insider trading.  Even then, Coinbase has said they have strict rules prohibiting that kind of trading by their employees, and they took BCH trading down for a while so they could investigate the accusation.  In any case, Coinbase had announced months ago that this was going to happen eventually, so it really wasn't a huge deal.

The other issue was something that happens on Coinbase (and other exchanges) whenever there's a big spike in activity.  The API goes down, or gets spotty.

"It achieved more than 1/6th of the main chains volume. That is more than reasonable magnitude. A $45,446,124,663 market cap is a lot more than ""reasonable magnitude"". The fees are already a small portion of what Bitcoins fees were when it has the same market cap and volume. Bitcoin cash is at least trying to scale where as the bitcoin core team wants to see bitcoin become ""Digital Gold"" now which was not the original plan and was not why a lot of people invested in the first place. Look at the stats before you blabber garbage just because you have invested your entry level job earnings into Bitcoin for a quick buck. The whole Bitcoin community is only in it for greed now and not for decentralization.

The ""Digital Gold"" vision is stupid. Bitcoin cores vision is for people to buy Bitcoin and hold bitcoin just to sell it at a higher price rather than becoming a currency. That is dumb, was not the vision of Satoshi and is bound to fail. It cannot be gold as there is no other reason to getting it than to make a quick buck. There is no longer incentive for the main blockchain of Bitcoin. It cannot bring decentralization to the masses.

"I haven't tried Monero in real life (mostly because I'd take several USDs in lost fees to do so) therefore I don't know if it really is that fast. Two minute block time  does sound to it's favor, though. Also, variable block size would make it scale better on-chain than BTC clones.

If Monero somehow manages to solve relatively high fees (bulletproofs might help to an extent) and make actually usable wallet GUI (current one hangs just too much) and hardware wallet, then I see no reason why it shouldn't replace BTC as world's No. 1 crypto-currency.
