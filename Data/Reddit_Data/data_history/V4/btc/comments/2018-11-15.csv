"Yes, I'll agree with you there, the FBI and all government agencies have been and are getting more and more corrupt... it's just disgusting.

I followed the two cases of the DEA agent and IRS agent who were found guilty of corruption.  These guys were not the sharpest tools in the shed and that's why their criminal exploits were caught.  And it just happened on a whim they were caught by some very awesome investigators in San Francisco... just barely caught these guys.  The two of them were completely independent of each other, not aware of the corruption the other was engaging in.  Which makes everyone who followed the cases think there are a lot more government agents guilty of more crimes and were smarter and covered their tracks.  The cases for this DEA agent and IRS agent never went to trial, so a lot of information never went public.  But from the publicly available information shared, these two guys were just really, really stupid.

The main reason I don't believe Ross' story about ""hackers"" is not only due to the overwhelming evidence against him and being caught red handed with an open latop containing detailed daily journals and backups in his night stand drawer dating back to times he claimed he was not administrator (well then he wouldn't have those backups on usb sticks then would he) -- not only that, but Ross claimed the 144,000 BTC on his computer were from his bitcoin trading ""expertise"".  However, he back tracked on that defense real quick when the prosecutors brought in some blockchain forensics experts and showed that all the coins on his computer came DIRECTLY from Silk Road, without any effort at washing or covering their source, just direct transactions from Silk Road to his electrum wallet.  The blockchain does not lie.  The defense dropped that argument real quick after this was brought up... and so what did he change his excuse to?  Hackers put the bitcoin on his computer.

Okay, first off, the blockchain does not lie.  Dates and payments cannot be forged or ""hacked"".  That's the beauty of Bitcoin - Proof of Work.

Second, no hacker in their right minds would frame someone and deposit $30 million to make it believable.  Maybe $20k, maybe even a few hundred thousand.  But $30 million, the entirety of Silk Road's profits over 2 years of operation, fully verifiable in the Bitcoin Blockchain?

Get over it dude, Ross was caught red handed, overwhelming evidence against him, and he still says ""it was the hackers mom!""

If he fessed up and apologized I would support him 100%.  But murder for hire with torture.  Fuck that shit.
