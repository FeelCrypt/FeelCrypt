We live in a first world country where we can make a credit card transaction nearly instantly. For a  $5 purchase it will never make sense to wait 8 minutes as the paper described. It is digits cash for any large purchase. There’s no need to fight credit cards in this stage of development for any cryptocurrency. I’m specifically describing industrialized nations and not third world countries which would be different. At this point if I️ need cash savings I️ rather have bitcoin than dollars. One is designed to be worth less over time to encourage spending and the other is designed to do the opposite. I’m not a fan boy and trying to argue for anything specifically, I’m just describing and average persons use cases. I may send 40 transactions a year and they are all large sums that don’t need to clear immediately. Either paying friends or purchasing large items etc. the rest of the time I️ just want my money to hold value.

"Here's the problem - we want third-world countries to be able to participate.  We want these third-world countries to be able to run nodes without huge money investments, because the government will confiscate their expensive equipment.  We want it to be relatively easy to set up a node, whether or not you think it's just super nerd enthusiasts.

I'm also stuck with Comcast, because there's no way in hell the other ISP in my area could serve me 1GB every 10 minutes.  It costs me $80 a month for my internet which is capped at 2TB, so **screw you and your 3-euro unlimited fiber I'M NOT BITTER**.  (I don't really mean that, good on Romania for understanding that internet is important)  So suffice it to say that your experience with internet is not globally applicable.

If block size were the primary scaling method, how long do you think it would take for node sizes to become big enough to fill up a terabyte in a month?  How fast is hard drive tech improving?  Is there a discrepancy between these two?  THAT question is what Core is trying to answer, and it's obvious that they're afraid of what answers they're finding.  I sure as hell trust Core more than the devs behind 2X.  Essentially, if you are going to wind up needing a datacenter to run a node, Bitcoin is not decentralized.

">Low fees and fast transfers.

>That’s the entire fucking definition of bitcoin.

What absolute misinformed garbage!

Where does it mention fast transfers and low fees being the main goal in the white paper? Hint: nowhere.

The definition of Bitcoin is based around the removal of 3rd party trust. Trust (in the context of removing the need for it) is mentioned 14 times in the white paper. That's the entire point of the blockchain, to remove the need for 3rd party trust. If someone just wanted a system where fees were low and transactions fast a globally distributed public ledger would be one of the last things they choose as a design.

I'd suggest people new to Bitcoin go read the white paper if they wonder what the point of Bitcoin is and find out for themselves. It isn't what this guy proclaims it is. You also shouldn't trust me either of course... just read and it will become obvious that the quoted comment above is incorrect at a fundamental level.

I'm not making a comment on fees here, if they are too high or what have you, I am merely pointing out that what you have proclaimed is so very painfully incorrect.";1;0;False;wintercooled;dpybete;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/
"It's possible for colluding miners to fool SPV wallets in certain ways. Colluding, cartelised miners can also refuse to process transactions and can orphan the chain of any miner who will process it (i.e. 51% attack).

Confiscation shouldn't be possible as far as I know, however it is possible with hard fork, so many are wary of ceding the miners the ""one-CPU one-vote"" democratic rights to change the protocol rules and still call the new chain bitcoin.

/r/bitcoin focuses on the centralisation problems of ASIC miners having created a set of powerful Chinese pools that are fairly closely affiliated and control about 50% of the hashrate.

Who gives a fuck what Satoshi's vision was? It's software. It's not a religion. That kind of dogmatic thinking means any upgrade to Bitcoin is challenged often with no good reason.

Not saying this is the only reason, but I think it's a part of the reason for the drop... There are a few exchanges that have stated publicly they are NOT giving the free bitcoin cash coins to their customers.  xapo.com is one.  They started with around 650k BCH and are down to 75k.   Bitmex was the latest I heard of a few days ago.  They are dumping all of their BCH coins and giving customers the value of each in btc.  I've been buying/selling BCH every night this week without investing more fiat and the downward movement is definitely happening in chunks.  I sell all my coins at the top of a small peak and assume it's going to drop hard shortly after.  Check the MFI and MACD to get a sense of when it's probably bottomed out and then buy everything back again.  The difference in price and the fact that btc has probably gone up in value while waiting, allows me to pickup all the coins and a few more.  Been trying to average 2 - 3 such trading sessions each night.  I view the big pump a week and a half ago as someone buying up a lot of coins that were probably just going to be dumped anyway. (not that that was the sole purpose, but I'm viewing it as a nice side effect)  Flush 'em out earlier than they would've dumped rather than a steady, slow leak of coins that keeps the price low longer than we'd like.  For all the coins being dumped now, yeah, it can drive the price down, but it also allows for some great trades as well as a fire sale if the price gets too low.   It's currently $905 as I write this.  Looking forward to picking up some more tonight.;2;0;False;RandyInLA;dpxkrpg;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"(One example) from the Google built-in dictionary:

""the US regretted the incident""'

That sounds like a more negative word than ""event"" to me. The Bitcoin Cash event was positive for Bitcoin (Cash) but negative for Bitcoin Segwit. It's good for Bitcoin Cash that it comes closer to ""the tippening"" or ""the cashening"". So from my perspective as a big blocker it was an event not an incident.

"You don't seem to know what's going on here.. Full nodes are not miners, and plenty of regular people run full nodes. 

Also bitcoin has no plans to reduce block time to 1 minute as you suggest. Both BCH and BTC have a 10 minute block time and 8MB and 1MB blocks respectively; BCH will require a higher sync time, higher ongoing bandwidth, and more CPU power. BTC's solution is to move unnecessary information out of the blockchain (segwit, schnorr signitures) and then move smaller payments out of the blockchain to higher layers (LN). BCH's solution is to increase blocksize again when full, further compounding those issues.

Yes, it does. With bigger blocks, there will be a longer sync time than without *for a full node*.

> Now you can pack them in 80 blocks of 1 MB or 10 blocks of 8 MB. Recall, they are exactly the same N transactions.

Yeah but you're not proposing having less blocks. You're proposing having the same amount of blocks, all of them 8MB. This doesn't make sense.

> Sending 80 block headers or 10

Again, talking about full-verifying nodes. No-one disputes the ability of running an SPV wallet at nearly any size block.

> ""A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.""

It already takes days on a (way above average by global standards) internet connection. More than half of the current block chain is since the 1mb blocks became full.

The impact of the initial sync is little to none *after* you've downloaded the blockchain? Well yeah, no shit, tautological statement of the year. The impact of a bullet to the brain is little to none **after** the bullet has struck you too... what's your point?

if I get banned in this sub for speaking the truth I don't care. BCH has potential, sure. However, will it replace bitcoin? I don't think so. Why? Without going into full detail, I'm want to keep this short, Bitcoin keeps it values when it comes to why it even came into existence and it's goals and does not sacrifice it for short term solutions to short term problems. I also believe that bitcoin will eventually need to increase it's blocksize as it will help a lot but what bitcoin cash is trying to do is already being done much better by so many other altcoins like dash and litecoin and even potentially bitcoin in the future which will make even them less valuable. So I don't see how bitcoin cash could replace bitcoin, outperform litecoin/dash/others or traditional players like paypal.;7;2;False;SouliG;dpxm10v;Bitcoin Cash sub 1000$ again..;7dbm3n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dbm3n/bitcoin_cash_sub_1000_again/

"Let's extend your argument then.  In order to be used globally on a regular basis, it wouldn't need to clear 7.2 million transactions daily, it would need to clear *3 billion* transactions daily.

On-chain scaling is not going to suffice.

We're talking 1GB blocks being transferred across the entire network every 10 minutes (or less) that need to be processed and verified by every full node.  Most people's internet will choke on downloading a gig every 10 minutes.  Anyone on Comcast would go over their 2TB limit in the first two weeks of the month, provided they were able to acquire the entire blockchain in the first place.  A 6TB hard drive costs around $180.  You would need to shell out that much money more than every month and a half, and somehow hook it up to your node, for a cost of $1400 a year just for data storage.

"Long term BCH has a very solid use case. Buying now is speculation, but long term, it has a chance of being one of the more popular cryptos. I think the price will stabilize over time, though who knows what that price will be. Buying now is speculation, and the price will rise and fall, just like every other crypto.

Getting rich with crypto is exactly this feeling you have now, that inner monologue saying, ""What if this investment goes to zero."" At this point, nothing is 100% going to work out, not even BTC.

They really do hate it.

"Exactly. 

OP is forgetting a key aspect. Bitcoin can not grow any more with the blocks limited to where they're at. It's at the ceiling already. When people send crypto to an exchange like bittrex, it costs them $20 and can take days. People will seek alternative trading pairs to buy with. Bitcoin can't grow much more than it currently is before something else will start to be used as the main trading pair at exchanges. And whatever that coin is, will overtake Bitcoin.

Also, Bitcoin Cash was $300 a few weeks ago. All that's happened is we had a FOMO after 2x was cancelled, then when the exchanges started crashing, it stopped it. But you've got to have patience, look at the bigger picture of what's happening here. Bitcoin will be unable to grow to $20,000 a coin because no one will spend $50 to buy $100 of coin, and even if they did, the coin being used to send to exchanges for the trading pairs would most certainly not be bitcoin. So these types of posts about Bitcoin Cash are way, way premature.

">The guy who developed the Solidity language wrote a $150,000,000 bug when using it. That's a problem with Ethereum itself.

No, it isn't. It is user error, regardless of who that user is. At best it's a problem with Solidity, but ethereum supports other languages, and more is to come. And either way, in the context of BCH, ethereum can do what BCH does, send and receive transactions, without touching its smart contract functionality at all.

>It can also all be done on a sidechain of bitcoin

A secondary smart contract system on bitcoin will never be able to beat a blockchain designed to accommodate smart contracts from the start.

>if it ever develops a use case which it hasn't yet.

This is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in weeks.

1. BTC has the highest probability of continuous growth, it's the safe play
2.  If you're going to trade alts, move profits into BTC, Increasing your BTC should always be the goal. Most big alt movements are pumps that will not last.

"Transparency is the key with tether yes. They have not proved thhey have $1 for every $1 USDT since March, when the crypto market took off. And they also offer leveraged margin trading on Bitfinex with USDT. So each one of those USDT, real or fake, can be leveraged to $5-10. If only 20% of the Tether is faked by Bitfinex, and they are leveraging on their own exchange, which there is good evidence for, then they have enough to prop the price like crazy with leverage. If that leveraged move goes wrong, they cover the loss from the 80% of real USD that has been deposited. 

Noone is claiming all USDT is unbacked. The problem gets even shadier for other the many people holding USDT if its only partially backed. If its not 100% 1:1 ratio, they should all be in prison.

"The argument is related to whether people can run full nodes or not. larger block sizes means more initial sync time, more ongoing bandwidth and processing power. A lot of people interpret ""I think people should be able to run full nodes"" as ""I think that everyone should run one"". Personally I don't want to be in a situation where it's unfeasible for a motivated average user to verify the full chain as Bitcoin would then, in my opinion, lose its trustlessness. Others disagree. Small blockers tend to favour layer 2 solutions like lightning networks.

The argument most people have in here is a variation of ""moore's law, as bitcoin grows, bandwith and harddisk space will get cheaper in tandem"" or ""no-one really needs to run a full node anyway except miners and large transaction processors/businesses, the rest can use SPV wallets (which only download the block headers and the details of relevant transactions)"". Big blockers tend to feel that in practise, lightning networks would not be all that peer-to-peer and would centralise on payment-processor hubs.

I fall on the small blocker side of things, but that's the best non-biased answer I can give. Those of us who are intellectually honest will admit this is by no means a completely settled debate on either side.

The very angry people in here are angry because they feel they're prevented from having the discussion in /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.

These little small things matter. Position BCH as the first named currency and leave BTC to be included under ""and more"" instead of the other way around. Support BCH and trade it now and kick BTC to the curb instead of the way it is now if you really feel that way.

"The people who say you can't upgrade the transaction limit. 

This bus is heading for a cliff the driver the developers are not in control they don't make the tiers nor do they mine the ore thats used to make the metal part that drive the motor.

The driver is in control of the bus even though he doesn't make or pay for the fule.

When you ask the driver who's in control of everything that comes together at any moment he tells you it's complicated everyone and no one is in control. He's just driving the bus.

He made a roadmap that goes nowhere and he says the passenger decide where the bus should go.

Everyone is OK.

Now 4 years ago someone noticed a cliff in the distance. The bus driver said don't worry we will turn befor then.

4 years later more passenger say we are headed for a clif just look.

The bus driver said it's not a cliff unless we all agree it's a cliff. Anyway I've made changes so the bus can fly.

And if you are confused look at my roadmap. 

Some of the passengers who paid for a front row seat said we've looked at everything this bus can't fly and we are going over a cliff. 

The developers said if you can convince everyone on the bus to turn then we can turn.

The passengers who paid for the front row seats said ok. And started to explain to the other passengers what was happening. 

The developers said new rules no talking in the bus. So forget r/bitcoin the very back row of the bus. I'm talkig about IRC where people talk to the bus driver.

The front row passengers who criticized the roadmap got a sock shoved in their mouths and hounded by passengers who said the rules of the bus say no talking.

But we headed for a cliff. No we are not they said we are just limiting capacity of the bus so we can fly to the moon. Just get off if you don't like it.

But that's a clif we're headed for a cliff and there are no jet engines or wings we can't fly.

Trust the bus driver they say. 

But he's not in control we are. 

Eventually you convince everyone that if you turn 20 degrees to the left it'll take a little longer before you go of the cliff. 

Everyone agrees expect the bus driver who is not in control he refused to listen and told everyone he's been driving this bus long enough to know what's hapening. 

He's not turning and you better get off at the next stop.

At the next stop the store owner sees this bus he's never seen anything so fantastic befor. The developers tells him how it works and how he is not in control and if you want on you just need a ticket. 

There are not enough tickets so you can just give anyone on bus enough of whatever they want and they'll get off. And please do I'm sick of the complaining. 

And so we head for a cliff the driver ignoring all the problems he refused to turn say everyone needs to agree and when everyone agrees he refused to agree as he is also a pasanger and probably the most important one.

Some investor disagreed and made a copy of the bus a replica in every way just the driver if he comes on board has to accept the investors hav turned 45 degrees to avoid the cliff and we're now going somewhere nicer.

Bitcoin is at $7800. You’re correct. But it should be at 15,000 or higher, which is exactly where it would be, if it hadn’t been completely smashed by the core Dev team over the last five years. 

We lost a massive amount of market share to ETH during the first “flippening” when congestion finally reached max capacity.  

And now we’ve lost even more market share to BCH and other Alts for the same reason.  All related to bitcoin failing as a cheap, fast transfer of value.  It’s original and main purpose.  And for no good reason except that (as Brian points out in this article) Core has some agenda. 

Tokyo announced BTC as a currency which is what shot us to the stratosphere back in April 2017. Not sure if you paid attention to that...  people started using it for commerce.

Technology can struggle as peer to peer cash, and still be a good store of value and 1000 other things.  One of bitcoin‘s greatest features is that it was supposed to be so many different things. 

But you can be assured that it’s at a significantly lower price right now than it would be, had it been allowed to flourish properly.

"> Right now bitcoin is definitely still breathing, and breathing quite well.

Bitcoin as a speculative asset class is ""breathing"" quite well ... I'm sure people said the same about tulips just before the tulip bubble bursted.  Bitcoin as a means of payment is not breathing well at all.  

I just read a fresh paper written by some consulting company yesterday, speculating that the Bitcoin value would be worth more than half a million in the future if it would take over a big majority of the payments.  The word ""payments"" was repeated over and over in the paper - not a single mention of the capacity limit there.  That's the major reason for the price growth, I think - most people out there aren't aware of the limitations, they just want to join in on the ride.  Bitcoin has become just yet another HYIP/Ponzi, it works and people may get insane returns on investments ... all until it doesn't work anymore.

The 1 MB limit is like putting a strict limit that your baby can only eat 300 grams of food and water every day.  I suppose it may have some security purpose, like preventing the nanny from overfeeding the baby.  However, as the baby grows of course it needs more than that!  Then there is the ""slippery slope""-argument, we certainly cannot afford feeding the little one with 500 kg of food every day, hence we cannot allow the 300 gram limit to be lifted!

To get beyond visa-level transaction volumes, we clearly need both to increase the limit, work on optimizations in the software and work on ways to optimize the data volume going into the blockchain itself (i.e. lightning).

Payment systems are very much dependent on the network effect.  We can have the best technology in the world, but it's kind of useless if your peers are still accepting nothing but paper money.  I think PGP is a good analogy, it was really impressive technology back in 1991 ... that's more than 25 years ago, and I still send emails in plain text as my peers don't support any kind of email encryption ... and ever so often my peers demands me to ""sign"" documents by printing out a paper, put my name on it in writing, and scan it again ... jeez.  Even worse, we have a government-approved digital signature system here in Norway, owned by the banks ... the banks distribute the tokens, the banks keeps the private keys, and ""signing"" a document can be done merely by reading it at the computer screen and then handing over a one-time-token and a password.  I'm quite sure that we would have had a proper decentralized secure global digital signature mechanism approved by most of the jurisdictions by now if just PGP adoption would have reached a critical mass back in the early 90s.

If the lightning upgrade solves all problems of scaling? Great! If the market moves to simple scaling from 2MB to 8MB and beyond and it works forever? Great, too!

"The free market is never optimal, but it always tends to being optimal on the long term. That is due to human nature: human beings are not always the most rational, but they tend to be rational on the long term (or they usually die because of their illusions which makes it work).

This does not mean that it is still a reasonable thing to think, but we have to admit that it is what most people do think right now. If you see such a discrepancy between reality and market, that is called an opportunity: you can invest in the future than no one else can see yet. Investing will help make other people notice it, and help the people who are already working on it by showing support.

Not to break the narrative, but that's exactly why Satoshi developed Bitcoin in the first place and why Bitcoin's white paper was released 2 weeks after 2008's financial crisis exploded.

Let's accept a fact: fiat money works, is consumer friendly. It takes 3 days generally, if not less, to transfer money around the globe.

The core principle of crypto currencies is to detach their logic from fiat, not to embrace them and get overly stressed on how much our whatever coin is worth in fiat.

If Bitcoin's use is to get hand in hand with fiat then it's no real alternative and is extremely weak in case governments decide to tackle it (as China proved it to be).

I profited out of cryptos, but at some point, the more I think and reason about it we're totally forgetting what the real purpose and use of cryptos is: an alternative to fiat and the ""corrupt banks and government"".

Ask yourself, what is going to happen the day more countries ban exchanges and will make impossible to swap fiat for cryptos?

Need to ask yourself one thing...  If a single miner goes down, what's the chance of broadcasting your transactions? (It's 100%).  If a single hub goes down in the LN, what's the chance of broadcasting your transaction?...

Which one of these models fits your definition of decentralization more?

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.  ~ Satoshi Nakamoto (2010-07-29)

"Thank you for your comment. I understand your concern, but I will attempt to show step-by-step why your concern is unfounded.

The idea that on-chain leads to greater centralization comes from the idea  that ""full nodes"" are important for most people to run, which comes in part from the idea that these clients allow greater security or ""sovereignty"" for ones transactions than simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets, which comes from the idea that SPV as described in Section 8 of the whitepaper requires fraud proofs in order to function as originally intended, which comes from the idea that the phrase ""[SPV] is more vulnerable when the network is overpowered by an attacker"" in that section refers to a majority attack rather than a minority attacker, which in some interpretations makes it seem that it is referring to an attack scenario where a majority hashpower miner is mining invalid blocks. But this scenario would contradict Bitcoin の fundamental premise, that miners are ""honest"" in the sense of being rationally profit-seeking, so it cannot be the intended interpretation. The intended interpretation must therefore be that ""[SPV] is more vulnerable when the network is overpowered by an attacker"" refers to a *minority* hashpower attacker. That is, a malicious and non-profit-driven-miner who, rather than seeking the much more viable approach of attempting a doublespend attack (which uses perfectly valid blocks), decides to try a much less viable atack: they try to mine an invalid block (such as one with extra block rewards). In the scenario Satoshi refers to, they as a minority miner has gotten very lucky and has managed to mine several blocks in a row before any other miner had mined any blocks. 

Under this scenario, an SPV wallet is temporarily fooled for a few blocks whereas a ""full node"" wallet is not. Thus the SPV wallet user must wait for a couple addiitional confirmations if they are receiving a high-value transaction. However, after a few transactions, even the remote odds that a substantial minority miner may try such  an attack retreat into complete statistical insignificance. 

Since SPV nodes cryptographically verify that all transactions they receive are valid and in a block in the longest chain, they have complete financial sovereignty. For security they merely have to wait a couple additional confirmations to guard against a very unlikely edge-case attack that ""full nodes"" are nit vuknerable against. However, both ""full nodes"" and SPV wallets are equally vulnerable to the far more viable and likely doublespend attack, which means this security difference is both very marginal and also negated by waiting a couple of extra transaction.

Likewise, the idea that on-chain scaling via having most users run SPV wallets leads to centralization comes from the idea that ""full nodes"" are less vulnerable to attack, which comes from both the aforementioned misconception that ""full nodes"" offer significantly greater security than SPV wallets, as well as the idea that """"full nodes"" somehow help the network, which comes from the idea that Bitcoin is a mesh network requiring ""relays"" to assist in transaction propagation, which is incorrect because Bitcoin's network topology  is semi-complete ring constituting a Newman-Strogatz-Watts small-world network with what is known as  ""giant component"" (a.k.a. giant node) in the network-distance-wise center  of the network graph where the miners are,  with an average network  distance of only 1.32. What all this means is that  almost every new transaction on the network reaches almost  every miner in a couple of seconds, without any help from ""full  nodes."" In fact, ""full nodes"" slightly slow down propagation by functioning as a mild Sybil attack on  the mining network.

Bitcoin is thus unassisted by ""full nodes"" and all its censorship resistance and decentralization comes from miner decentralization and SPV's very solid (as explained above) cryptographic guarantees.";12;0;False;ForkiusMaximus;dpyy46k;You want to go grab a coffee??;7dk9ah;https://i.redd.it/5dcnsdhqsiyz.jpg

A terabyte hard drive will safely store a decade of transactions for 35 $.

Yet none of you complains on how the network depends on mining farms and pools, which are very centralized.

Double standards?

Mind you, I'm no fan of either Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash as I'm no fan of any Proof of Work coin (they all promote centralization in a way or another, plus I'm against using so much energy to validate transactions) but the argument for not scaling block size is pure bullshit especially since the very nature of LN will lead towards centralized hubs that will require fees for routing regardless.

This at the price of no longer making transactions p2p.

Reality is that blockchains are shared databases, databases get bigger with time. Any other solution is no longer p2p, is weak, can be regulated (see LN).

*The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.*

"In fairness, it was equally as powerful and well reasoned as the claim to which it was responding.

But even if the claim that ""big blocks will lead to dangerous centralization"" *were* true (and frankly I've never found any of the arguments in support of that proposition to be very convincing), that wouldn't justify any particular block size limit. You'd still need to define what constitutes ""big"" blocks.  Obviously a binding limit can be too small.  For example, if tomorrow BTC soft forked the block size limit down to 1 kb, allowing perhaps one non-coinbase transaction per block, clearly that would not promote healthy ""decentralization""; quite the opposite, it would render the blockchain essentially unusable.  It's equally clear that if we tried to keep the 1-MB limit indefinitely while attempting to achieve truly global adoption, that would *eventually* have the same destructive effect.  (At 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.) In other words: even if you're 100% convinced that we need (or will eventually need) *some* economically-binding ""consensus-rule""-type block size limit (because you're not convinced that a ""natural"" limit exists or will be sufficient), that doesn't tell us anything about *where* that limit should be set. It's *very* unlikely that 1 MB is the ""magic number"" that is getting the current tradeoffs just right (or is even within an order of magnitude of that number). Even if it were, it's essentially impossible that it would *stay* the right number as conditions change (e.g., as technology improves). 

Clinging to a crude, arbitrary, and always-intended-to-be-temporary limit long after it's become inadequate while Bitcoin's user experience continues to degrade, destroying essentially every use case other than pure speculation, that's not ""being conservative"" as some have tried to claim, that is recklessness.

"Just to entertain you, I personally run both a BTC and BCH full node with zero cost difference at this point.

To look at how costs (and what I think the argument is, centralization due to cost) _may_ diverge over the course of the next few years:

### Storage
If BCH had BTC's current traffic, blocks would largely average between 0.5MB and 2MB, but for the sake of argument, let's say each block is *full* at 4MB for the next 12 months. This would be an increase in the blockchain size (without additional compaction or pruning) of ~210GB. The current blockchain size is going on 200GB now. Now let's say the next year they go to *full* 6MB blocks all year, adding an additional ~315GB, and 8GB the year after, adding another 420GB.

This is to say, that with BCH becoming _way_ more popular than it currently is and requiring scaling _far beyond_ anything we anticipate. The blockchain size will be ~1.2TB 3 years from today.

On Amazon, currently, you can purchase a 2TB hard drive for $50-70. That price is expected to drop and/or storage for the same price will have increased by 3 years from today.

### Network Speed
To propagate new blocks, you'll need to be able to transfer them reasonably quickly (at least < 10 minutes, ideally quicker than 5). On an old-school 128kbps, a single 8MB block (not including any extraneous metadata or peer communications) can be transfered in just over 60 seconds. Now, honestly, nobody running a node _today_ should have that low of a connection, let alone 3 years from today at super-scaled 8MB capacity.

### Network Costs
This is an interesting one that comes up from time to time. Not many full nodes are likely running on metered connections (though my own VPS hosts are _limited_ connections). 

Block size itself isn't a particularly important factor here, as without side-chains being active (as they aren't today), sending 8000 1MB blocks uses the same, though technically slightly more, data than sending 1000 8MB blocks. People also enjoy mentioning the initial blockchain download duration as a factor here, but again, 1000 8MB blocks take up the same space and bandwidth as 8000 1MB blocks.

I fail to see where a simple block size increase, under any reasonable expectation (obviously we wouldn't jump to 1GB blocks this year), causes additional centralization. 

### Why does any of this matter for ""centralization""?
1) It's technically true that ""off-chain"" scaling could _limit_ the growth of the blockchain over time (which is potentially only important if we're hitting ~32MB before HDD/Network scaling has caught up), but we do not have evidence that this is remotely required due to technological advancements, nor are these off-chain options available today. We also don't have evidence that less nodes actually causes centralization issues, since mining is already largely centralized due to ASICs.

2) The fact is that _not everyone needs to run a node_. Many more well-off Bitcoin users, or enthusiasts as myself just wanting to support the network, will happily run them. It's also quite likely that companies invested in the space will also run full nodes to also support the overall network. Miners by nature will act as full nodes, and as the crypto space becomes more generally adopted, mining will become less and less centralized over time as well.

So? The size of the blockchain has never been a problem and anyone using that to justify a computer science reason for anything is wrong. Regardless, this is a $300 fix, today. In 3 years It will probably be a $75 fix.

The Bitcoin problem is UTXO processing. If you don't understand what that is, you shouldn't be making the argument you are making.

> 1000 8MB blocks take up the same space and bandwidth as 8000 1MB blocks.

And this is exactly why the people making the argument you are making are consistently wrong and do not understand. Disk space does not matter. The types of transaction, the number of sig hashes, matter. My 1MB block may take a lot longer to verify than your 1MB block. But /r/Bitcoin does not understand this.

Pairs? It's clear you *don't* understand how exchanges work. We're not discussing trading pairs here.

Here's another problem with your logic: the implication of what you're saying is that Bitfinex has 100% of its customers' USD holdings in the form of USDT. Why do you think that, as opposed to say, that Bitfinex is operating a fractional reserve? 

Since Bitfinex hasn't announced either scenario, why are you assuming one instead of the other? You claimed that ""the most token amount of research"" would settle this, yet you can't provide a relevant reference.

"**Bitfinex hack**

The second-biggest breach of a Bitcoin exchange platform, Bitfinex, caused 120,000 units of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which was valued at $72 million at the time, to be stolen. Bitfinex first announced the security breach on August 2, 2016. The bitcoin was taken from users' segregated wallets and Bitfinex has been tracking down the hack. Significant hacker funds transactions were signed off by Bitfinex's security provider, without full security.

Lets just estimate that the addition of .55% additional buying pressure increased the price by .55% since supply is constant. .55% of $7800 is ~$43 per bitcoin price inflation, The market cap of bitcoin is based on price per bitcoin * 16,684,612 BTC = $715 million dollars in increased market cap  
**$30 million USDT = $715 million market cap**

"Bitfinex has a sister company called Tether. They issue tokens over the Bitcoin blockchain called Tether Dollars (USDT). 

These are tokens that Bitfinex redeems on par for USD, they're IOUs for USD. The reasoning behind using it is that USD is hard to send but sending USDT is just as easy to send as sending Bitcoin around the world. This makes it very easy to move around funds representative of USD over the blockchain. This is why you'll see Bitfinex, Poloniex, and Bittrex all have prices very closely in line with one and other. This is because it's very easy to pull off arbitrage between those exchanges as they all accept USD.

Anyhow a bunch of conspiracy theorist spread FUD speculating that Bitfinex doesn't have the USD to back USDT and/or that they are issuing USDT out of thin air without any corresponding USD to back it and are then using this to buy up crypto and that that's why we're in a  bubble. Anyhow that's all FUD there is no proof, it's no more than a conspiracy. There obviously is counter party risk when using USDT though that you must be aware of and that is that USDT only have the value of USD so long as Bitfinex continues to redeem it for USD.";-1;3;False;PoliticalDissidents;dpy7rbf;More on Bitfinex's Tethers being fraud.

While the smart investors or criminal masterminds who bought early and reaping the benefits by getting out and liquidating their coins into cold hard cash or into their checkings whatever come out as winners but eventually they too will become losers. Everyone buying bitcoin with their cash are banking that the value in bitcoin they will be able to buy things trading bitcoin for services or goods.

"Should be noted that Bittrex and Poloniex only use USDT and have no USD. This introduced large counter party risk on their behalf. As for Karken however they do deal in USD and trade USDT as free floating so no counter party risk there.

Anyhow yes it's a goofy conspiracy. 

For starters if Bitfinex wanted to create fake USD out of thin air to buy up BTC then why would they do it fully transparently on the blockchain? They could more easily do it internally off chain in their own ledger within the exchange and keep this activity private,  just the same as any exchange be it Bitstamp or Gemini, or Kraken could just as easily do there's no need for Tether to be capable of doing this. Them using Tether gives us more insight into their actives if anything. If they're going to commit fraud why would they do it out in open?

Secondly [Tether has a market cap of $615,847,906](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) meanwhile we can verify that [Bitfinex's cold storage currently hold $1.3 billion worth of BTC](https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r). Then we need to take into account that they also have a hot wallet and hot wallets and cold storage for many altcoins.

"Let me explain in very simple words how this whole thing works:

1- Bitfinex does not have access to banking, and so nobody can deposit or withdraw USD.

2- Tether is the exclusive way to get ""USD"" onto the exchange.

3- Bitfinex exchanges USDT balance at a fixed 1:1 rate into USD within their platform.

So this is how it works:

Sucker A deposits USDT

Bitfinex converts that balance at 1:1 into ""USD""

Sucker B sells some bitcoin, getting Sucker A's ""USD""

Sucker B must then convert this ""USD"" to USDT before it can be withdrawn.

So Bitfinex doesn't need any actual USD because they force people to convert it 1:1 for USDT anyway. Literally all they do is take the ""T"" off the end of the symbol, no USD ever changes hands, these are not USD markets. You cannot deposit or withdraw USD from Finex.

"Yes.  ""Second layer"" off-chain solutions of various kinds are possible.  These would replace many smaller economic transactions with larger on-chain ones.  For example, if you fill up with gas regularly at one brand, they can allow you to pre-fund, or use credit with them, for multiple purchases, which are then settled with a single larger one.

My small credit union I bank with, assuming they adopt cryptocurrencies in the future, can relay customer transaction information off-chain to other such organization, and only settle up with each other daily on-chain.

Such off-chain solutions don't have to be adopted by everyone, but to the extent they are, they offload the transaction space.

In addition to that, there is no requirement that nodes have to be run by individuals.  Local communities can fund ""community nodes"" with higher grade hardware and bandwidth.  They would get a small monthly fee to defray costs, like people pay for VPN services today.  Their users can then run a light wallet instead of a full node.

In a world where 8 or 32 times as many transactions are happening, you can assume there are substantially more users than today, therefore enough users to fund community nodes.

Lastly, the existence of many cryptocurrencies and exchanges can ""shard"" the block size problem.

"I think the most important thing to remember is that the block size is only a maximum. Each block is not at that size unless the transactions needed to be processed are that high.

So if we said the block can be 1GB maximum they would not actually be that large unless the world did suddenly want to change and central banks began to fall over night. I think we both know that won't happen, or at the least wouldn't happen suddenly.

High fees prevent that wider adoption though. It stops businesses to want to use it. It prevents poor people from using it. This is why low transaction fees are more important than cheap nodes.

Say Bitcoin was used a lot more. VISA can process 10,000 transactions a second. That would be equivalent to a 1GB block size. People think that would make it so hard to run a node that very few would, and open the network to attack. The thing is every business that accepts Bitcoin, not through a third party, would run a node. So would enthusiasts. So would all exchanges and miners. So the node count would increase.

"Imho we should mention the conflict every time we promote Bitcoin cash for a couple of reasons:

>If we don't, many people will just assume the ad is about bitcoin


>If people notice that these are two separate coins we are talking about, we need to clarify why they have similar names. Because otherwise we do sound like a Chinese ripoff / scam (Bitconnect also shares the same starting characters, this is no coincidence) 


>The arguments are on our side, and if a person who vaguely knows bitcoin hears them, it might sparkle interest

That being said, I'm sure criticism is welcomed by everyone so that future ads could be perfected.

My only piece of advice is that we should totally mention that MOST of the original creators and promoters of Bitcoin have left (been kicked off) Bitcoin and moved on to this project.

"More importantly, ads need to answer the ""*What's In It For Me*"" question for the audience. Most people have barely heard of Bitcoin (if they are involved, they likely didn't need the radio ad to change their mind), and the ad need to educate and entice. Basically, think about what your audience cares about (difficulty of transferring money, flexibility) and target that, rather than focusing on making a political point to make yourself feel good.

"We don't need hobbyists to run nodes. It was never meant to be like that after a certain point, which we are well beyond.

If a business can afford the fees associated with accepting credit cards, they can afford the cost of setting up a full node.

We're discussing 1GB blocks, by the way... something that is years and years and years away... so businesses can easily run a Bitcoin Cash node on a $300 machine today, like I do at home.

So this problem you're trying to avoid of it being too expensive is not even an issue at the moment. It only becomes an issue when blocks become very large, at which point, it will be much cheaper than it is today to run a node that can handle it.

"You don't need to personally.

What it comes down to is have low costs to run a node and what happens? Hobbyists, small business, media business, and very large business with data centers run them.

Okay now we increase the cost to run a node. We'll now no more hobbyist but run a node but hey small business, medium business, and larges ones still do.

Ok now we increase to costs of running a node more. Now even the small business stop doing it because it's two expensive. So they out source it to the medium and large businesses.

Okay now we need more transaction capacity. Alright now it costs too much for the medium business. Why would they pay thousands of dollars when  the large business will let them use their nodes?

Oh now there's only a handful of large businesses running nodes, enforcing the ruleset, propagating transactions, validating blocks. Well then it's suddenly centralized. That also means it's easy to censor transactions for them. It's easy for them to know who's sending what too. 

Decentralization is dependant on having many small little participants in the network. The more little participants having a tiny role the more decentralized. The less participants the more centralized.

The bigger the blocks the more centralized the smaller them more decentralized. That's a fact. Every time we increase block size that much he acknowledged. Of course there's no point to a super decentralized network that can't be used either. But simply increasing block size as a solution for everything doesn't help to keep the network decentralized.

">  for a few thousand dollars.

Yep. That's the problem. If you need a few thousand dollars to run the only P2P part of the network for a node that generates you zero revenue then why would you use it? You want you'll out source those costs to someone else who is. But if a node can be run on $300 hardware (which is certainty can today and with larger blocks as well of a few MB) and do it on consumer broadband then then you (be it a hobbyist or a business) 

It's not just hardware too. It's internet bandwidth restrictions too and block propagation time across the network. 1 GB blocks would require gigabit internet.

Miners don't want 1 GB blocks either. Especially since many of them are in China where internet infrastructure is week. Big blocks increase orphan rate. Even if the hardware can handle it it's a matter of distributing that block across the entire network of nodes around the world, have each of them verify it in full, and then make sure that this all happens in the time span of 10 minutes, if it takes 11 minutes the system starts falling apart and it can't remain decentralized.
