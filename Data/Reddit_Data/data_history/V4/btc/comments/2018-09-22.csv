"i'm against drugs anyways. simply because of the causing violence. i'm not from the us tho. when i was in jail, waiting for my trial, i met all these drugheads who complained that granny didn't gave them the bag with 300$ so they hat to beat the her up in order to rob them. and everybody agreed, she should just have had give him the money. all these moron drugusers who don't have their life under control are disgusting pieces of shit. if it's up to me: lock them up for life. if you're just a drugdealer and run business smooth, i disagree with lifetime penalties, but as soon violence occurs i get mad. especially if the violince is (most likely) against people who have nothing to do with that shit. i don't want somebody kills my parents because they don't wanna get robbed and say no. 

it's nice that ross created something that people can buy drugs and live off of ratings like amazon just to buy the purest shit. beautiful. goverment should run a goverment platform then and provide the country with drugs.";1;0;False;kallebo1337;e6fumfz;Ross Ulbricht shares recent family picture;9h6rch;https://i.redd.it/8syyezmb48n11.jpg

No man, he solved the biggest problem among “niggas” (if you gonna apologize just don’t use the word) with his idea, that’s VIOLENCE. He allowed trust and anonymity in the drug business which closed the door to gang violence and bad quality drugs, overdosing deads and so on. This guy got rich out of that and maybe he should have satoshied the whole thing and disappeared, but what he achieved could only be achieved through the total legalization of drugs. I don’t think a drug dealer is more of a criminal than a pharma company or a war mongerer or a weapons manufacturer. Check your double standards.;5;1;False;Javihache;e6fpyym;Ross Ulbricht shares recent family picture;9h6rch;https://i.redd.it/8syyezmb48n11.jpg
