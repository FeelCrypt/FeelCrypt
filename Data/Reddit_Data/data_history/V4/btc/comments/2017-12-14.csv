"I was a trader 5 years, I survived the crash, now I own bitcoin and I am Hodling for the long long term, I have been following this for some time and to be honest I am as lost as all of you, I am very confused about this whole thing, something is going on, I hope some of you can help me answer the following:

1) How can Bitfinex be insolvent if they are trading in volumes this high daily?

2) Bitfinex is issuing Tethers and sending them to other exchanges, I get that, but someone else has to buy them right? They can issue 10 billion Tethers but what is the use if no one is buying them?

3) Given the trading volume of Tethers, are you all aware of members of the community actively day trading Tethers? I follow a lot of people on Twitter and I rarely hear about people trading it so who is trading the almost one billion in tethers? this is very important folks, yes we know Tethers are generated but some poor sucker has to buy them right?

4) let's say Tethers are being issued and dumped onto poor souls on other exchanges, why buy other cryptos? why not just use that cash to stay solvent or increase profits?

from my experience as a trader I am highly  skeptical that this volume of fake Tethers can have an effect on the price on the bitcoin, 
 
6) So let's say Bitfinex is just dumping tethers and hoarding other cryptos, what is the purpose of this? What is the big plan here? Money Laundering? Fraud? or are they simply using the generated cash to day trade in Bitcoin and other cryptos? to me day trading in cryptos sounds like the most logical explanation to what Bitfinex might be doing here, 

7) If Bitfinex is actively day trading in other cryptos and not just acting as an exchange, this can have devastating consequences if we see a downturn in the market, ever heard of Nick Leeson anyone? 

a) best case is they are making insane profits day trading in Cryptos and everything is just fine for now, 

b) Worst case scenario is Bitfinex could have already lost millions of dollars day trading or from being hacked and is actively day trading to try to cover losses and stay afloat, if this is the scenario then Bitfinex is a ticking time bomb that will implode sooner or later, this could happen as early as next month or as late as 5 years, again do yourself a favor and google ""Nick Leeson"" better yet, go on youtube and watch the movie, Nick Leeson is also on twitter ;-)

8) Now the billion dollar question, the most important question of all everyone, under what Jurisdiction does Bitfinex fall? anyone here know? where are they registered? listed? where is there office? who are the owners? where are those people? 

which country or government or legal entity can actually interfere, step in, investigate and prosecute?

Coinbase for example is registered in the US, we all know that, they have to answer to the US government, who does Bitfinex answer to? If you are registered in Panama or the virgin islands are you out of reach of prosecutors? can you really do whatever you want and get away with it? Is is really that easy?    

Could regulators and government agencies already be aware something is going on but can't interfere simply because because Bitfinex is not registered in the US and is simply untouchable?

Can I, with reasonable certainty, state that Coinbase/GDAX is not in a risk similar to Bitfinex due to it being (to a degree plausible in the crypto world) a regulated exchange, therefore being backed by an actual bank and using actual fiat currency when entering or leaving the exchange?

It might take a while to fully grok this: Cryptocurrency is easy to buy, but old fashioned fiat money is difficult to sell. Does that make sense? No it doesn't, but let it sink in a little and it will. There's a few other exchanges where you can sell fiat, but the business of selling fiat is pretty controlled. You might have more success selling something, anything else. If you have any sort of business or craft you do, or a service you could provide, anything except fiat money would be a better product. There are lots of people selling fiat, it's a saturated market, even if you can get over the hurdles it's not the best thing to sell. Think what other value you can provide. Provide value up front and request donations, that works really well for something and it'd surely get you a few satoshi here and there! $0.10 /u/tippr;6;1;False;mungojelly;dr99zbz;Blockchain.info now fully support Bitcoin Cash!;7jqrun;https://i.redd.it/l2oyqqof7v301.png

"**Internet troll**

In Internet slang, a troll (, ) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting quarrels or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal, on-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement.

This sense of both the noun and the verb ""troll"" is associated with Internet discourse, but also has been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with online harassment. For example, the mass media have used ""troll"" to mean ""a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families"".

"Not correct. Bitcoin is a name of the system. if you want to follow that system, you are effectively not using / running a Bitcoin system. This is why when someone uses the Bitcoin code and changes it, they create an altcoin.

Bitcoin Cash used the Bitcoin code, SegWit change it. Lighting network is nothing like a Bitcoin system... so if someone should have right to use the Bitcoin name, it should be Bitcoin Cash... but... as the Bitcoin system is defined to be the one that is the longest chain (most PoW) technically Bitcoin core still has this (the portion not using SegWit)... but this will change...

"Thinking for yourself is a very deep thing. It requires *fully* divorcing your social signaling and affiliations from your intellectual reasoning process, which requires seeing beyond the social pressure exerted by words and their socially mediated pre-delineation of conceptspace along lines determined by the utility function and presumptions of the society/subculture/tribe from which the terms arose. 

The tribal instinct is to ignore, downplay, and compartmentalize basic linguistic facts such as that words can have multiple definitions, that a word precisely enough defined in one context may need to be refined for use in another context or in deeper investigation, that indeed a word merely *refers* to a concept and isn't itself the concept referred to. The hallmark of tribalistic thinkers is therefore the tendency to systematically equivocate between distinct meanings of the same term, completely unconsciously, leading to a mess of [circularities and internal contradictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/60i3kq/lets_list_some_core_paradoxes/) that they maintain in their mind with no apparent difficulty, sliding around on the rails of words like they're kids playing Chutes and Ladders, believing they are reasoning rigorously with their impeccable logical rigor while they make a mockery of the equally crucial yet seldom discussed *semantic* rigor. 

For example, the Core tribe - including of course the rBitcoin mods - uses the terms ""altcoin"" and ""consensus"" in two distinct senses *each* (two definitions for each of the two terms) and implicitly equivocates between them in order to comfortably argue in a circle without noticing it. One sense of altcoin is: ""An altcoin is different ledger, like Litecoin, Ethereum, etc."" The other is: ""An altcoin is anything that breaks consensus,"" where consensus here means consensus with Core, but plays on the other meaning (Nakamoto consensus, which has nothing to do with consensus *before the fact*; as Satoshi explained, mining is a block-by-block vote) when they say or imply that ""Bitcoin cannot work without consensus."" They equivocate systematically this way in order to form an argument whose logic in terms of words-as-thing-described is perfect but whose answer is still obviously wrong because the words switch around what they are describing midway through the argument:

""BCH is an altcoin just like Litecoin and Ethereum because it didn't have consensus and Bitcoin is a consensus-based system.""

It passes over the reader like butter, carrying the sheen of eminent correctness, yet it is total nonsense word-salad. Two meanings of altcoin being used simultaneously, two meanings of consensus being implied simultaneously, switched between at the arguer's convenience to reach a completely false conclusion. This systematic equivocation on terms allows the tribal thinker to use a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" dynamic to answer all objections in a way that everyone whose mindset is colored by tribal emotions will be especially susceptible to. 

Going through the thread linked above you can see how almost every Core paradox arises from or is perpetuated by some semantic oddity that most Core supporters are unable to see past because their tribal emotions are especially strong (BCH has some tribal thinking, too, as humans will be humans, but being the rebel group rather than the joiner group those tendencies are naturally far weaker), and those emotions are partly tasked with keeping you on the rails of the words in order to ensure tribal unity (tribes in the ancestral environment changed situations slowly, didn't need to refine and re-examine words for use in novel situations constantly).

The antidote is a constant re-examination of the key terms (fork, Bitcoin, altcoin, consensus, fee market, scaling, decentralization, ledger, node, implementation, full blocks, and all the rest - there are fatal traps lurking in every single one of these words), a borderline sticklerish adherance to clear terms rather than immediately socially expedient ones, and ultimately to think beyond the words entirely. 

Thinking for yourself goes past merely reasoning for yourself under the constant guidance of the word-rails created for you by the tribe. Reason all you want about BCH and BTC, you'll never see the situation clearly if you narrate your thought process with ambiguous words that constantly pull you back onto the rails of Core's preconceptions that are baked into their habitual language. Thinking for yourself requires seeing that words are merely communication tools, a means of gesturing toward some concept or thing deemed to be a useful partition of the world or the subject under consideration. 

A word coined in haste or arising from the casual custom of everyday chatter will rarely be reliable when borrowed into different contexts where rigor matters, yet this borrowing is the standard practice even among otherwise smart people, with the loose borrowed term inured to a fixture over time unless challenged early on, its pernicious effect then leeching into the discourse and thought process of everyone who fails to perform a thorough vetting - and almost inevitably a thorough revamping - of the jargon themselves against overwhelming social resistance (to the effect that, in the height of irony, you are ""arguing semantics"" when it is in fact they whose arguments are built of semantic cotton candy you seek to unwind by introducing clarity).

The word ""fork"" itself was lazily borrowed in from software terminology, thereby erecting the rails of utility along the biases of the coders: that Bitcoin is primarily a software project rather than an economic one. Not content to stop at the seminal sin of Platonism by turning a verb into a noun, common parlance (sufficiently clear for a software project, but not sufficiently clear for Bitcoin) introduces further ambiguity by loosely referring to the results of said fork as themselves forks. ""The Bitcoin fork resulted in two forks."" [The terminology is FUBAR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6dcybs/unfubaring_cores_terminology_part_1_full/). One should say at least that Bitcoin forked into two branches or two chains, but there is much still left unclear there, and again there is social pressure against [laying it out as ""sticklerishly"" as it needs to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fecjx/diagram_explaining_what_is_being_said_when_the/dqbi36j/) in order to simply avoid bumbling into a swamp of error by slipping along some faulty word rails. 

This is what we're up against, in every field. Words and our tribal instincts and social ties and desire for social status cloud and distort our judgment every step of the way, even to the point of convincing us 100% that we are reasoning impeccably even as we commit the most egregious fallacies of circularity and internal contradiction (that most insidious category of fallacies, those based in semantics) in almost every sentence, mostly only mitigated by our insistence on checking in with reality every once in a while (and the censorship, neh, outright debate manipulation, thwarts even that, oddly mimicking this internal mental doublethink situation in a walled garden where readers are convinced they're getting the full, undistorted story thanks to - wait for it, another equivocation - moderation).";17;3;False;ForkiusMaximus;dr88p7l;It's now been a week since @Willwaukee tried to prove that rising fees on #BitcoinCore aren't real.

"The whole idea is insane.

I'm comfortable with managing counterparty risk. I have no problem whatsoever entrusting small amounts of my decentralized crypto to a centralized entity (aka ""bank"") so I can transact cheaply and easily with merchants and let the bank decide when it makes sense to actually move coins on-chain.

Banks and other centralized services that hold private keys on your behalf are 100% fine as long as they are optional and have to compete with each other to provide value to their customers in exchange for the fees they collect. In many jurisdictions they will be regulated which increases their degree of trustworthiness significantly.

Anyone who has kept coins in Coinbase or put them on an exchange or deposited them with a gaming service is already transacting this way.

The low, low bar LN has to clear to be worthwhile at all is to be superior to such centralized services. And so far it isn't. You have to pay fees every time you want to hop on or hop off, you have to monitor the network to make sure you're not being defrauded by a counterparty and there's no solution in sight for the routing problem.

"> but at what point can no one support a full node?

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

"1. Finding the route is not a simple problem for a large network.
Finding the shortest path is quadratic complexity. However, the assumption seems to be that the balances on the channels are static. Its insufficient to find just a route. It needs to find a route where there is enough liquidity (maxflow) and this needs to occur in a network where the balances change in real time! At 3tx/sec, your route is already obsolete by the time the routing information is gathered and a route is computed! What are you gonna do? Retry until it works? A million nodes running a million tx/day with balances changing every second. Are you going to tell the nodes to ""hold the balance"" while I send a LN tx? The whole LN idea seems not to be thought through completely.

2. Why would anyone want to open a channel to pay a person just once or when the flow is only one way? If the response is ""open a new channel"" then this statement is partially falsified:

> You seem to be misunderstanding what LN does. You won’t have to open and close channels for every transaction.

If people have to pay directly even 10% of the time, they wont see the point of opening even a single channel

\3. The update method results will always be obsolete, right? From the time a channel is opened or closed to the propagation, it will always have stale information.

If LN makes payments instant and cheap/free, crypto has won. Everyone in crypto wants this result.

"No, that's not correct. They can use the $20 immediately literally after you sent it, no confirmation needed on chain. If you're a business you want to be able to use your funds immediately, and without fees ideally. There are no IOUs, lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions.

You only need to touch the main channels for these reasons:

1. You want to move some coins from your LN channels to a cold wallet, because you accumulated too much bitcoins on your channels that you don't need for daily use.
2. You want to extend your LN channels so you can swing higher with your spendings, and incomes. For example, at the beginning you may only want to use LN for small expenses and income, like pay per view, tips, etc. so you only keep one channel in your wallet with up to $100, but later you decide you want to be able to buy groceries and accept freelance payments, you may increase it to $1,000, at this point you have to do an on-chain transaction.

"You are right regarding the payment channels, and what LN added.

1. The whole network topology is now stored, so it's easy to calculate the route. As the network grows this will need to be improved, and it's not an insolvable problem. Wallets can compete to find the best algo to provide you with the lowest fees.

2. If there is no enough liquidity you can still send the funds the regular way, or open a channel directly. However this will only happen if the value is unusually big, and will happen less and less as the network and adoption grows.

3. The protocol includes a method to update.

4. I don't know, good question. Need to investigate.

5. They could indeed try that but they would take a huge risk, because they can't know how far you're willing to go to punish them. You may be willing to pay an on-chain fee to punish them that is more that you're set to lose, and they would lose all the funds including their own in result. Also, the network won't be clogged because the blocksize will be raised gradually to serve LN.

LN testnet does exists and you can open your own nodes and channels, you don't have to use hardcoded channels (not sure what you mean by that).

We will see if your prediction is right or wrong, but if it was indeed true that there is no analysis of any sort you can't be sure of you being right either, right? :)

I personally think that LN will be useful for certain special situations for the first phase.

"Yes. Channels can open and close automatically, depending on the actions taken the by the user. For example on testnet now, if you want to send to an entity with the wallet that can't be routed to, it opens a new channel to them, but in the great majority of cases on main-net payments would route through existing channels because everything will be connected. The LN layer will be virtually transparent to the average user. All the users experience is that they can get bitcoin and and can spend bitcoin. All confirms instantly, faster than a credit card, the fees are very low, and the transactions are hidden from the public (no transaction explorer).

This is not over-engineered at all. It uses bitcoin's scripting language that was intended to be used for such smart contracts. All we're doing here is pre-confirming bitcoin transactions so at point of purchase you don't have to wait for confirmations, yet you get to transact in bitcoin instantly.

Also, remember that LN wallets also function as regular wallets, and since the transactions will be reduced on the main chain, it will be feasible to open/close and transact on-chain without huge fees.";3;2;False;binarygold;dr8r1hy;I thought Bitcoin Cash was the fraud;7jr9a2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jr9a2/i_thought_bitcoin_cash_was_the_fraud/

"> Transaction capacity is only dependable on how many transactions one can send in internet, ultimately.

This is true in the case of IOTA. It's not true in the case of Bitcoin, because it depends on how many transactions you can pack into a single block. Bitcoin Cash makes the assumption that computation can scale sufficiently enough to handle computation, due to moore's law. I think that argument is much better than Bitcoin Core's model which incentivizes economic centralization.

> Increasing block size is a very easy way to pack those transactions, full nodes are not required everywhere, one can transmit only block headers, which is a small string of numbers. That's all that it is required.

Blocksize can increase to handle human transactions. It cannot increase to handle machine economy transactions. This should be obvious because machines grow at the rate of moore's law, so if Bitcoin Cash's scalability depends on moore's law to handle human transactions (which it does), then there's no way it could handle machines as well. Imagine all the microwaves, refrigerators, cars, airplanes, rockets, drones, vending machines, entire energy grid, all AI, and computers in general all able to trade with one another in a way much more rapid and continuous than people tend to trade. There's no hope Bitcoin Cash could scale to handle the quintillions of transactions we'll see.";2;2;False;somebody3830;dr8qups;I thought Bitcoin Cash was the fraud;7jr9a2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jr9a2/i_thought_bitcoin_cash_was_the_fraud/

You have this wrong. You would never EVER open a channel to make one payment and then close it, that's not the point. The point is if you open a channel with someone, we'll stick with Starbucks, you can put say $500 in that channel. With this you can buy your morning coffee then route through this channel to the deli down the street to buy lunch then maybe route through Starbucks and the deli to the grocery store to buy dinner. Then you could route through Starbucks to the deli to the grocery store to your neighbor or your electric company or what have you all while only opening the one channel. You could potentially keep this channel open for a long time if you put a lot of money on it so you don't have to pay to open and close channels. The gift card analogy is a poor one because a gift card only works at one place, when you open a channel you could potentially distribute those funds to a limitless amount of places ;8;5;False;jfarn96;dr8k0mn;I thought Bitcoin Cash was the fraud;7jr9a2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jr9a2/i_thought_bitcoin_cash_was_the_fraud/

"Initially bch seemed appealing because it is faster and cheaper to transact. This is only a superficially appealing because its an easy point of relation and understanding to most people that are just entering the crypto space.  

Every time I listen to someone that actually seems to be highly knowledgeable in the tech they comment how the quick fixes by bch, which yield those better transfers, come at costs that are at the foundation of BTC. So that's what I mean on the surface it seems good but the reality, as far as I can tell, is that it's a good marketing campaign. Just listen to someone like Roger Ver vs someone like Adreas. Roger seems to have two talking points that only relate to those immediately accessible, easy understand aspects. He never addresses how having larger blocks might affect centralization or security, which imo are much at the core of what btc than pumping out quick fixes. While Andreas always does an excellent job of conveying both sides

"Thanks for the link. I don't understand how that text supports the claim that Core will never raise the blocksize. And, btw, I do agree that blocksize should be increased as soon as possible gradually, maybe at 5% increments at every difficulty reset.

Do you believe this is a lie?

> at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

No, what I'm explaining is just basic computer science. A computer can only process so much data, and only so fast. Computers aren't some magical boxes that can do unlimited calculations. You can remove the limit to block size but you will still ultimately bump up against the limits of computation. A computer somewhere still has to process a block regardless of its size. Moore's law suggests that the computation will continue to scale. That's great, but machines are computers - so if those continue to scale, then there's no way we can rely on moore's law for machine economy.

SPV clients help normal users but they won't solve this problem. A miner somewhere still has to process the entire block. Otherwise the SPV doesn't work.

IOTA solves this problem using a better data structure. There are no miners, and therefore no bottleneck.

> Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don’t generate and don’t participate in the node network. They wouldn’t need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain). If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we’ll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes. At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.

And the real kicker is that on-chain BCH transactions will STILL be cheaper than Lightning transactions, and when people realize that they will ask what was the point of the last 5 years of waiting for Lightning.

That is doable because BCH is about disintermediation, whereas Lightning is about intermediation. The only way Lightning can work is people getting paid to do Lightning transactions, that means intermediation, means that Lightning transactions may end up more expensive than BCH transactions.

At that point, all BCH needs to do is be able to scale on-chain.

With hodlers only, price stays flat or drops.

If the new money goes elsewhere, price climbs slower or doesn't go up at all.

I want my $10 on my gift card I have not spent yet and Starbucks wants there $10 because they have a business to run.

Some comments saying, just wait for it to go up more, don't spend it now etc, and one saying next time buy more to cover the fees and dilute the loss. 

Short of the fees coming down, he's actually down to around $60 or less since he won't be able to spend it or move it anywhere again without getting hit with fees.

A 40% loss right off the bat if he does anything but hold.

Rather than creating yet another altcoin (it does not have the network effect, it does not have the market cap, it does not have the most proof of work - hence it cannot be something better than an altcoin), why not promote one of the best altcoins as ""Bitcoin 2.0""?

"You seem to be misunderstanding what LN does. You won’t have to open and close channels for every transaction.

You or the exchange you buy your bitcoin from opens a channel for you if you choose to the first time you buy bitcoin, then you can spend the bitcoins on channel instantly, confidentially and either free or for an extreme low fee. As you spend you channel opens up to receive on channel too. So if somebody wants to tip you then can fill your channel back up. Still no on-chain transaction.

You can spend and receive thousands of times without the need to settle.

The only time you need to touch the main chain (rebalance) when you have too much bitcoin in your channels and you want to put some of it in cold storage, or you want to increase the size of your channel so you can have larger swings between paying and being paid on channels.

Once the system is widely used people will only occasionally make on-chain transactions for initial channel openings, rebalancing and for making large value transactions like buying or selling a car, house or company. For everything else they will have the pre-confirmed channels to make micro-bitcoin transactions on. 

The next cool thing some people are working on are payment streams, this is another layer on top of LN and will create a new paradigm in monetary transactions for exchange of goods that are continuous like electricity or server time. You will be able to set a rate of payment like $1/min and you would be receiving money continuously in fractions of satoshi increments (yes, LN can do that) as long as your are providing a service. All these things are clearly where the future is and not possible on-chain. On-chain is so 2013.

"The LN will not even scale as advertised because it requires solving one of the hardest problems in computer science: the shortest path problem. No one has refuted this for me yet, and I think it's because they can't. The best known algorithms for this problem are sub quadratic. So basically, it will be super fast at small scale, but once many people start using it, it'll become exponentially slower. Good scalability becomes exponentially faster. The only crypto currency that achieves good scalability is IOTA.

Having said that, Bitcoin Cash is a better alternative than Bitcoin Core because it at least scales linearly with the blocksize. Which means the exponential growth of computation could in theory allow it to scale for at least human transactions. It will fall short of scaling to machine transactions though, because that implies moore's law will have to outpace itself (omnipotent paradox in essence). IOTA can scale to handle machine and human transactions though.";6;2;False;somebody3830;dr8n4on;I thought Bitcoin Cash was the fraud;7jr9a2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jr9a2/i_thought_bitcoin_cash_was_the_fraud/

"How do you know that a few chinese miners will control it? How do they control it?

I would say that BCH has the original blockchain, complete with all of the historical transactions, and fulfills the goals of the whitepaper.

I do not think that BCH only focuses on a block size increase, but that was the best fix to the most urgent problem facing Bitcoin and what forced the fork.  It also removed the Segwit softfork malware and fixed the quadratic hashing issue.  Not only can it scale, it is creating innovative ways of improving scaling.  It has multiple development teams, creating multiple clients and is not centralized in one team or one approval structure.  Therefore, if one team tries to wrest control, we can all choose whether to use their software or not.

This is why I say BCH is the real Bitcoin.  BTC could have remained there, but for reasons we may never know, BTC decided to break our agreements and trash the scaling plan we had all agreed upon.  Now, they promise vaporware, after implementing a very questionable change that did nothing to solve the issues we had right now.

"I think we all went into this with a habit of only having and keeping track of a single currency, and that's determined a lot of the shape of all of the markets, the fact that there are star currencies that everything else revolves around. We try to make it all simpler than it really is, by just pretending simplicity onto it.

Like, Litecoin was a good launch, a solid coin, a network that's survived for a while, and it's under active development which is nice. None of that is why it's worth such an incredible amount, it's all because of its premier crypto status, its position in the middle of the market. Lots of places put LTC trading pairs, because it's premier and because it made the numbers look more comprehensible for small value coins. 

I don't think it had to be that way. If instead of these weird cobbled exchanges we were using, say, one open source exchange software that lots of people were running, and that software easily exchanged zillions of coins with arbitrarily precise prices, well you can imagine whole different shapes to the market. It is the way we expect it to be, the way we need it to be to comprehend it. 

But it also is always just a little bit beyond comprehension. There's newness to it. People don't know how the fuck it works. Nobody knows how it works because it's new.

Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.

He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

2. The max amount transferable is determined by the smallest value along the chain of channel hops. What if there is no route that has enough liquidity?

5. What happens if one of the many hops decides to steal the money and all the recovery tx are clogged on the network?

"Interestingly, this paragraph that describes the problem Bitcoin aims to solve, accepts a very important postulate in its design:

> A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.

Bitcoin has the ability to bring the potential for fraud on the network to within this acceptable ""*risk margin*"" by providing the non-reversible feature (confirmations) in a timely manner (difficulty target time). Time multiplied by work required to reverse a transaction equals security of the transaction.

Bitcoin does *not* have the ability to **eliminate** fraudulent digital payment. In fact, there's no such thing. Lightning declares to be able to do it, but that's a lie: it simply reduces the risk to a manageable margin (by way of a fraud-response failsafe). It's still possible to execute a fraudulent Bitcoin transaction by way of double spend. It's possible to execute a Bitcoin Cash double spend.

"This is basically what I've been calling ""Fordian economics"". Now, this is a terrible misnomer because Ford was not an economist, but a businessman; but his philosophy was one that embraced economics.

Ford believed that if you pay workers a good wage and provide a pleasant work environment, they will be more productive and dedicated to your company, which results in more profitable goods and services being produced - as well as more workers-become-consumers flush with disposable income ready to buy those goods and services. He founded a car company on that philosophy, and proved its success.

It's the same philosophy behind investing (not to be confused with day trading, which is speculation). You front money to a company you believe will use the money to become successful and earn you a return on your investment. While you personally benefit, there is a societal benefit in that a new good, service, or competitor is able to enter the market - and if that societal benefit did not appear to have a profitable model, you would not invest in it, no matter what good it actually does.

"People need to re-read the white paper. It's literally the first paragraph.

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.

"> a ""store of value"" only has utility insofar as it can be readily exchanged

No that's a currency. A store of value has utility if its secure and doesn't lose value over time. That's why so many trillions are in gold, although it's been losing value lately.

imho one doesn't have to be anti-bitcoin to be pro-bitcoin cash. Bitcoin is unique because it was the first, is the biggest and is going mainstream. Maybe it won't work as a currency but I think it will take a lot of $$$ from gold and function as a ""safe"" store of value, protected from inflation, war, economic crashes, etc. That's a lot of utility. It will also give some credibility to the crypto space. 

Bitcoin cash may be the better currency. Time will tell. I think the alt coins will be battling it out for the king of the crypto currencies for a long time.

Here, read this, and decide if it's worth continuing this debate.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value

> A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
>
>The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset. **Money is one of the best stores of value because of its liquidity, that is, it can easily be exchanged for other goods and services**

Any asset that can be bought or sold can ""store value"" . on that we obvious agree.  but the point of a store of value is to provide a liquid risk-management hedge.  a priceless piece of art may ""store value"" but if it's illiquid or can be ruined with a spilled Coke, then it's not a *good* store of value.

So this whole issue is about balancing two of the primary utilities of Bitcoin in the face of big growth -- censorship resistance, and affordability. Unfortunately, because this work is being done in the free market, it's a big old grey area. Nobody fucking knows. Nobody can agree.

"It is a contradiction for something to have ""a store of value"" and have ""no underlying utility"".  For a store of value, by definition, has utility. And I don't think the adjective ""underlying"" clearly points in the semantic direction you are after.

I think what you are driving at is the distinction between something having utility as a store of value and something having utility as a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions).

With that distinction you could assert (if this was your view) that BTC, at the moment, has limited or no utility as a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions) and only has utility as a store of value.

And note that being a store of value is enough to make it ""a collectible"". But that doesn't exclude it from being a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions). That is, ""a collectible"" can also be a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions).

"> Isn't there onion routing on ln?

If the hub is forced to comply with KYC/AML (as it most certainly will, if there are only a few large hubs), it will have to know the real-world identity of the parties in any payment. It would have to refuse any payment requests that fail to disclose that information.

By the way, IIUC the ""onion routing"" in the LN ""implementations"" out there only would prevents the players from knowing the IPs of users, and (maybe) prevent the middlemen of a multi-hop payment from knowing the LN ids of the end nodes.  

However the path finding service must know the LN ids of all the users involved in the chosen path, and the LN ids of the two users who exchange a channel payment anywhere and must report it to the finder.

"Sorry, I skipped the words ""has a working solution"" in the first sentence; now fixed.

An intermediate topology could be a few dozen large hubs, well connected to each other; with each user connected usually to one hub, possibly to two or more hubs and/or other users; and each hub running its own path finder service.  

That topology has the problems of both the fully centralized and fully decentralized topologies. 

+ As you say, each hub would know about all significant payments to and from its own users.  

+ Paths would get longer and more expensive (two or more hub fees, instead of one).  

+ The hub funding problem would be worse: not only Walmart's hub X would have to put millions of funding in the outgoing channel, but any other hub Y that serves Walmart clients would have to put a lot of funding in the Y to X channel.  

+ Users with more than one channel may be unable to make a payment, because their total balance, even if sufficient, is badly split among the channels.  (Such a user could try to shift all her LN balance to one channel by making one or more closed-loop LN payments to herself.  However, the balance of each channel is restricted by its initial funding, so she may not be able to reach the needed balance in any single channel.)

More generally,  a large hub has many advantages -- for itself and for its users -- than two independent hubs half its size.  Therefore, just as mining got centralized in a few pools,  the LN would very probably evolve to an equally centralized topology, with only a few large hubs and everybody connected to just one hub.

"LN can be used for larger transactions, in fact the current rhetoric is to use it for all  “small” transactions (relative to BTC fees), eg the coffee in their mainnet test (hardly micro).

Here’s the thing I’m a bit mystified about - while I think there are unknowns about centralization, routing etc, even if you waved those away, LN depends on being able to execute timely transactions as the core part of its security/functional model (HTLCs) - how does it even get enforced when there are permanent 100K tx backlogs?

Also fundamentally, opening and closing a channel (loading your prepaid card so to speak) requires 2 txs. Current median BTC tx’s are about $15/tx - at $30 for opening/closing a channel, you would need to execute on the order of 1000 LN txs just to get to the 1-5c level that BCH, DASH etc provide natively. For micro-transactions it seems like LN would actually be more effective on BCH (or practically any other chain) than on BTC (per above, I don’t know how it can even work with full blocks). LN’s ability to do off-chain cross-chain atomic swaps also makes me ask, how does this benefit BTC except as a onetime off ramp to stop using BTC?

Worth noting that while I find LN problematic, make no mistake - it, or some other technologies (child chains, parachains, sharding) will be required for any transactional system scaling for global usage - naive on-chain scaling might give 10x or even 100x, but I don’t think is a reasonable solution for the 1000x or 10000x even 1Mx required for anyone shooting to handle any sort of society-altering transactional capacity. We’re still early in “land grab” mode, and without any single solution that will be a silver bullet, why so many from both the BTC and the BCH community both seem so intent on rejecting different parts of the solution is actually what worries me the most. The end result will be the same (being overtaken by newer, more utility-focused projects that will embrace the “all of the above” mentality; one only has to look at ETH to see what that might look like).";2;1;False;cryptoballer;dr8d2o1;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

Communications between users and services like the path finders would not go through the Lightning Network itself.  They would go through the internet, or some network implemented on top of the internet (like email, Tor, VPN, etc).  

The ""channels"" of the LN would be just special UTXOs in the blockchain.  They are not physical or virtual communication links, cannot really carry information or anything.  Likewise the ""nodes"" in the LN are not physical or virtual computers, but only bit strings that identify the LN users.

Those UTXOs are ""channels"" only  abstractly, in the sense that (for example) the general LN payment is a list of simple payments, each associated to one of those special UTXOs, with the constraint that the UTXOs of every two consecutive payments  have addresses associated to the same LN user ID.

"> makes people accept transactions that are unconfirmed as if they were confirmed. This is inherently insecure

Yes, doubly so.

As you note, there is no guarantee that the transactions exchanged through a payment channel will be accepted by the miners.  The receiver can demand that those transactions include significant fees, but there is no way to predict what fee will be necessary in the future.  Also, any soft fork could make those transactions invalid.

There is also another problem.   Whatever mechanism is used for channel payments, either party can cancel recent payments by sending to the miners a transaction that closes the channel according to an earlier state, when the balance was more favorable to her.  

The ""solution"" proposed for this problem is to put a temporary freeze on the funds freed by unilateral channel closure; to have each party monitor the blockchain, at least daily, watching for such fraudulent closures; and giving her the means to override the fraudulent closure and punish the other party -- if she can get that action confirmed while the funds are still frozen.

This idea can fail if the victim is forced to be offline long enough for the output of the fraudulent closure to be unfrozen, or if her punishment transaction gets delayed in a backlog.  

Thus, these punishment transactions are is a solution only in the sense that RBF is a solution to the BTC congestion problem: that is, not a real solution but only a ""hackers' solution""  -- a hack that *may* work some of the time.

"Some people here may be filled with anger and hatred, other people may be full of concerns that Lightning in reality will become a centralized payment solution (i.e. a handful of bigger exchanges running lightning nodes - we don't need any advanced routing protocols for that to work), and perhaps even some people here are *afraid* of the lightning network because if it really will fulfill its promises, there is no point of the BCH-coin anymore.

However, I think most people here share with me a strong belief that lightning *will not and cannot* fulfill its promise, because it's essentially a Mars Desert Research Station with a promise that we'll all be able to go to Mars - while in reality it won't even get us to the moon.

"Interesting article, hadn't seen that.  I just have 1 complaint:

>In order to route the money, Bob has to have at least 1 BTC in his “balance” in the channel with Carol. Essentially, Alice is borrowing from Bob to pay Carol.

>Bob transfers his 1 BTC to Carol in the [Bob->Carol] channel, and Alice transfers 1 BTC to Bob in the [Alice->Bob] channel. That’s how it works — **Alice cannot “give” the 1 BTC to Bob to then pass along to Carol.**

I don't think that's correct.  It seems to assume that transactions can only be time-locked all to the same time, but they can be timelocked to different times.  So Alice could send 1BTC to bob with a 3 day timelock, and bob could send 1BTC to carol with a 2 day timelock.

"For an asset o be a viable store of value over a certain time span X, there must be some confidence that the asset will have retained its exchange value at the end of that span. 

Even though they do not really have intrinsic value, dollars are a very good store of value for up to a few months, because it is extremely unlikely that they will lose a significant fraction of their purchasing power in that span.  Besides the inertia of the huge mass of people and businesses that use the dollar as currency, the Federal  Reserve has the mission and means to keep the dollar's purchasing power stable (apart from the small yearly inflation).  

For longer spans, like a few years, or for amounts so large that a 2% loss is worth worrying about, there are other assets with no intrinsic value that can be better stores of value than dollars: such as treasury bonds or bank debt notes, that promise by contract to pay back with inflation correction plus a small interest.  

In contrast, cryptos are assets with no intrinsic value that have no entity with obligation and means to preserve their value, even over a few hours.  Their market price is wholly based on hopes that the prices will rise in the future; and those hopes are based largely in misinformation spread by ""bitcoin peddlers"" like the Winkles, Draper, Casares, etc.  

AAPL shares are virtual tradable tokens that represent property of fractions of Apple -- all its factories, stores, stockpiles, patents, contracts, and all its future profits.  The market cap of AAPL of 172 billion USD is what the investors in the stock market think that those very real assets are worth.

Bitcoins are virtual tradable tokens that do not represent anything else.  The 277 billion USD market cap of BTC is not the estimate of value of anything.  That money does not exist anywhere, and there is no real stuff anywhere -- not even patent or copyright rights -- that is worth any penny of that money.   

That number is a deficit, a measure of the illusion of bitcoin holders:  it is how much money NEW investors would have to invest, in order for the current holders to receive the value that they THINK they have.  And, of course, if those new investors were to materialize and give all that money to current holders, the deficit would not be extinguished -- it would only pass on to those new investors.

Thus, bitcoin cannot be a store of value, because the money that is put into it does not get turned into something with the same value, that the bitcoin holder owns and may later exchange back for money.  Any investment into bitcoin just goes to the pockets of  current holders (or miners), and the investor gets nothing in return.  To get the money back, the bitcoin investor must find another sucket who is willing to give him that money, in exchange of ... the same nothing.";2;1;False;jstolfi;dr94sex;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

Satoshi never claimed or implied that bitcoin would replace those traditional payment methods.  His solution to the ""scaling problem"" was to deny that the problem existed: because he assumed that usage would grow way more slowly than Moore's Law rate (~50% per year).

"> For example, suppose that a channel still can send 0.123 BTCfrom X to Y. If finder A thinks that it can carry 0.10, and finder B thinks it can carry 0.07, they are both OK.
> 
> However, in order to maintain such consistency, a finder must be informed immediately of any payment that would change his view of the channel. In that example, if X sends 0.04 BTC to Y, finder A (at least) must be notified immediately that the channel can no longer send 0.010 but only 0.083 BTC.

But the scenario I'm discussing it that A and B both make their paths at close to the same time, and send a transaction along the path. Whichever ""gets there first"" would (could) put the funds on the channel below the amounts the other needs to complete the path. So A gets through, and B doesn't.

Ah, yes, yes, that is another big rock on the road to a decentralized path finding mechanism.   

> a transaction is an actual packet of data, that includes the route and instructions of the transaction in it

Not quite.  The output of the path finding algorithm is just a list of payment channels that share the middleman nodes  (Alice->Bob, Bob->Claire, Claire->Dave, ..., Yves->Zoe), and hopefully all have enough funds remaining to send the desired amount.  

Once the path has been chosen, the nodes (users) in that path must negotiate among themselves a cryptographic ""contract"": a set of LN channel payments, one for each channel in the path.  The crypto magic is such that, at the end, either all those channel payments are valid and are exchanged by those users, or the negotiation fails an none of the payments happen. 

If two path finders found conflicting paths, that together exceed the capacity of some channel, at least one of the negotiations will fail.  

In fact, the negotiation may fail also if the path finder previously failed, for some reason, to receive the news of a payment through the Dave->Eric that reduced the capacity of that channel.  Or if  Claire dropped offline before the negotiation could succeed. Or if Mike decided to raise his middleman's fee, and Alice did not agree to that.  Or if Zoe got impatient and walked off.  Or whatever.

If the negotiation fails for one path, then Alice and/or Zoe must ask the path finder(s) for an alternative path that does not include any of the offending nodes and channels.  Those extra requirements may or may not make the path finder's job harder, depending on what algorithm it uses.  However, they may result in a ""no such path"" response.  In that case,  Alice and Zoe would have no easy alternatives.";2;0;False;jstolfi;dr8onaz;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

"> is a hard fork. The exact opposite of a soft fork

You got it exactly reversed.  

Soft forks are claimed (incorrectly) to be ""backwards compatible"" because old client apps can continue to **receive** transactions that are sent after the fork.  However, those clients may have to upgrade anyway, if the old app might generate the sort of transaction that the soft fork has invalidated.  

That was the case with the BIP66 fork, that outlawed certain alternatives in signatures that previously were allowed.  It was (mostly) not the case with SegWit, because it only banned certain uses of a certain script opcode that no one had reason to use anyway.

It was blockstream and the ""New Core"" devs who created the misleading mystique that ""soft forks are good, hard forks are bad"".  

One reason was that a soft fork can be imposed on everyone, once a majority of the miners start applying it.  Thus, if a change can be implemented as a soft fork (which was the whole point of SegWit), the devs don't have to explain the change to the users and convince most them that it is a good change and they must all upgrade.  Like the Bitcoin Cash devs had to do when they had to change the DAA (a hard fork).  

Another reason was that raising the block size limit would require a hard fork, and Blockstream's roadmap absolutely required the bitcoin network to become congested.

Miners literally installing hardware in some cave in the Arctic complete with their own generators and all mining happening on an anonymous network like Tor.  Crazy.   (This assumes that there is continued demand for cryptos).  Or ""rogue"" states like ISIS also running bitcoin mining to fund their operations.  They have guns and some territory so they can say ""fuck you"" to US and EU regulators.  Crazy.

Or it could go the other route -- we all end up using something like scrypt or Cryptonight based cryptos and all mine on our personal computers -- hundreds of thousands of little miners securing a crypto.  fuck you government. Police this!

Essentially it boils down to the age-old risk of governments outlawing or otherwise restricting cryptos, to which the counter-argument is you can't really completely kill cryptos because the world is a big place and uniform regulations or control are unlikely to happen because it's so hard to police.

Interesting.  I hadn't thought of the miner AML/KYC risk.  Thanks for that.

Yes, every channel update is broadcast to every peer (at least this is what was available just a few weeks ago) which means it scales like onchain Bitcoin but without SPV because every channel endpoint is a peer; whereas with Bitcoin only miners and fullnodes are peers that receive gossip.

"I'm all about thinking exponentially, but doing some math is probably worthwhile as well.

180KB/600s = 300B/s = 2400bps - that puts us at say, 1992? Netflix's 4K streaming bitrate is 15.6Mbps (average US Internet connection speed is 18.7Mbps according to Akamai) - that's 8000X over the course of 25 years, not bad! (comes out to about a 36% annual growth rate).

Currently global avg internet speed and IP traffic has been clocked at growing at about 20-25% per year (Cisco et al), which comes out to about 2X every 3 years.

BCH has 8MB blocks currently (and only a 4X increase to 32MB - math, remember?), that might get you to about 100tps, but how realistic is the rest? A jump to 1GB blocks mind you only get you to 3Ktps, but requires a 30X of transmission and storage (this would require 15 years, not two years of growth rates depending on how safe you think the current upper limit is). While I don't have M0 or M1 transaction rates handy, Alipay alone clocks in at peaks of over 250Ktps today. To handle that on-chain would require 80GB blocks.

Suffice to say, I *don't* think I agree that any amount of on-chain capacity expansion can fulfill even a fraction of the transactional demands of existing payment services, much less any of the other purpose a decentralized ledger can serve (honestly, other technologies may have eaten Bitcoin's lunch there already, but that's besides the point unless you're some sort of maximalist).";1;1;False;cryptoballer;dr8lpux;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

Old dude here.

I remember when downloading a 180K GIF took ten minutes and usually failed.

When you're sitting there, and the state of the art is ""one lo-res frame per ten minutes"" then the idea that this thing could scale up to support 240 megapixels *per second* of 4K video sounds pretty much like impossible bullshit.  And yet, here we are, 30 years later, and people are streaming 4K video *practically for free* to their homes.

BCH is already prepared for 32X blocks.  32X is a **fuckton** of extra scaling.  in 2018 BCH will lift the 32MB protocol limit and then will be on track for another step-function increase in capacity.

Gigabyte blocks *are not sci-fi* but will be production ready within two years, easy.  We already know how to solve parallel validation, there are no unsolved problems here: all that is required is to optimize the code and specify a caliber of machine capable of handling the throughput.  These machines exist today and in 18-36 months will be extremely affordable.

I've worked my entire adult life in infotech.  The budgets required to host gigabyte blocks *even today* are well within the reach of millions of companies.  And we're years away from needing blocks this big.

So no, I don't subscribe to the theory that ""bigger blocks won't scale.""   They will scale until they don't, which is to say, for now, and for the foreseeable future, we have abundant onchain capacity.

While I will **absolutely welcome** any sort of orthogonal scaling proposals, I think we need to start by agreeing that there is so much potential for onchain capacity already, that it's unclear what purpose these offchain solutions really serve at least for many more years.";2;2;False;jessquit;dr8k2ah;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

"Internet routing is logically centralized.  The ICANN distributes IP ranges to countries, and the NIC in each country assigns individual IPs to users or internet service providers.  The telecom companies that implement the backbone in each country know the IPs of their subscribers and how to route packets to them.  The DNS and routing tables in the various gateways are built with information obtained from those sources.

Thus, unless your partner is in the same ISP or other local network, your packets almost certainly will go through cables and routers owned by one or a few big Telecom companies.

Apart from being centralzied, packet routing through the internet also differs from path finding in the LN in several aspects.  For one thing, in the internet there is no concept of ""current channel balance"" that changes dynamically and limits which packets can go through a given data link.  

Also there is no need to ""freeze"" all links in the path of of an internet packet, while the packet is in transit.  In this regard, the LN is more like the old telephone network (as of 1980, say), in which each call required setting up a dedicated circuit through switchboards and trunk cables, which were locked up for the duration of the call.";5;1;False;jstolfi;dr87bjh;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

"> each nodes understanding of the state of the network will not be the same

If there are two or more path-finders (for instance, if every node runs a path finding algorithm on it own), they do not have to agree on their knowledge of channel states, as long as they are both consistent with the truth.  

For example, suppose that a channel still can send 0.123 BTCfrom X to Y.  If finder A thinks that it can carry 0.10, and finder B thinks it can carry 0.07, they are both OK.  

However, in order to maintain such consistency, a finder must be informed immediately of any payment that would change his view of the channel. In that example, if X sends 0.04 BTC to Y, finder A (at least) must be notified immediately that the channel can no longer send 0.010 but only 0.083 BTC. 

> each node will need to maintain some kind of table that it can use to pre-calculate the route.

Each finder must maintain a picture of the network and the remaining capacity of each channel.  It can obtain the network by scanning the blockchain and collecting all UTXOs that look like payment channels.  However the remaining capacity is not in the blockhain; every user must tell every finder, at least about significant payments.

> the anticipated network architecture would be a set of “local” networks.

There is such a proposal, called the FLARE algorithm.  In a network of a million users, it could have a few thousand partially overlapping local networks, each with a few thousand users and a ""beacon"" (path finding) node.  If  Alice wants to send a payment to Zoe, each would send a request to her respective beacon, A0 or Z0.  The beacons would somehow find a user Mike that lies on both local networks.  Then A0 finds a path from Alice to Mike, Z0  finds one from Mike to Zoe, and the two paths together would be the desired payment path.

This schema is more efficient than every node running its own path finder.  Still, the local networks must be large enough and numerous enough to ensure that any two of them have at least one node in common, that is willing to serve as a middleman.  I don't know how one could ensure this condition.  Anyway every user would still have to report every payment he makes to the beacons of all the local networks that contain it.";2;1;False;jstolfi;dr8aua3;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

Thus any soft fork can potentially invalidate any transaction that was valid when created but was only sent to miners after the fork.  Such as the transactions that are exchanged through a payment channel.

"> The lightning network is economically useful even if the route finding is centralised.

The only topology for which path finding has a working solution has one big hub and every user with a payment channel for that hub.  Then the hub of course knows the state of all channels in real time, and path fining is trivial because every path has two hops with the hub in the middle.

Being centralized is a big flaw, because it takes away the only advantage of bitcoin.  The hub would have to comply with AML/KYC and would be able to censor any payment, without reason or explanation.  If that topology is OK, one might as well use PayPal, which would be much better in every aspect.

Another big problem with that topology is that the hub must provide funding, from its own pockets, for all outgoing channels; and the funding must be sufficient to cover all payments that each user may receive in (say) one day,  Now consider that the users are supposed to include thousands of merchants and services like Walmart, Starbucks, etc..  Where is the hub going to get enough coins to fund those channels?

"In order to find a path from Alice to Zoe, the path-finding mechanism needs to know the current capacity of every channel, namely the channel's initial funding minus the net amount of LN payments sent through it so far.  

The path finder does not have to find an optimal path; any reasonable path would be OK.  Therefore, it does not need to know the exact channel capacities.  That is, if the net payment through a channel so far is 0.1275 BTC, it is OK if the path finder knows only that it is between 0.1 and 0.2 BTC.  

Even so, the path finder needs to know of any payment that is large enough to change that approximate balance; or, if many small payments are made through the channel, it must be notified every time they add up to a significant amount.

Therefore, every time Alice makes a significant payment to Zoe, she must promptly notify the path-finding server(s) about it.  If the payment went through a path of six hops, all six payments must be promptly reported to the path finder. 

The current implementation, IIUC, has a toy path finding algorithm that runs on every node, and keeps track of the current state of every channel.  Therefore, every node must be notified of every payment made by any user in the network.   If there were a million nodes, each making one significant LN payment per day, each node would have to receive and process one million notifications per day.  This is actually worse scaling than the original bitcoin network with SPV client wallets.

One could use a single central path finding server, or a few servers.  Either way, any such server would have to know about every significant payment made by every user.  So the original promise of confidentiality would be lost.

If some of those notifications are delayed or fail to reach a path finder, the latter will occasionally return a path that cannot, in fact, carry the desired payment. A failure rate of 1% may be high enough to drive users away.  

Moreover, once the path finder has chosen a path, the selected middlemen nodes must  ""freeze"" the relevant channels until the payment is negotiated and executed, or the negotiation fails.

The ""path finding problem"" is inventing an algorithm that would be decentralized, reliable,  and scale better than the original bitcoin network.  And would preserve the confidentiality of payments of the original LN concept.  It is not obvious that such an algorithm will ever be found...";20;6;False;jstolfi;dr855zw;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

If and when there is standardized routing in place (even though it can not possibly be what is advertised), I would consider it alpha. But even that doesn't guarantee functionality, let alone market success.

People are having a hard enough time understanding and using Bitcoin wallets, which are completely fire and forget. Something that requires you to stay online in order to keep your funds safe, that requires locking your funds in a smart manner? It is not only going to be hub-and-spoke centralization, people are going to use functionally custodial systems which pretend they are not.

The technology is more suited to applications like decentralized casinos or CryptoKittens on the Ethereum network. But those would have a hard time existing in Bitcoin with its current limitations anyway.

"> As someone who has studied software development, as well as design methodologies, I'm sorry but your classification system and definitions are really bad.

Yes, I admit that they are what I deduce from general usage, not what software engineering textbooks may say.

> A proof of concept proves a concept that needs to be proven. It's easy to imagine some innovative functionality that does not need a proof of concept. Imagine a button on an app called ""beer me"" that you tap while in a hockey stadium, and you are auto charged and have a beer delivered to your seat. No proof of concept required, this is obviously possible to implement. Yet it is arguably innovative. A prototype might be nice, though.

I don't see how these remarks contradict what I have written.  If a project does not have any really innovative ideas, indeed it does not need a proof of concept implementation.  

(Although the ""beer me"" inventors may worry whether the beer can get to the customer's seat in any reasonable time, and whether such a service can handle 50'000 fans suddenly feeling thirsty after the Budweiser ad is flashed on the billboards...)

Unlike Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Cash is a minimally viable payment system -- but only as good as bitcoin was in 2014.  While the shared history and name with old Bitcoin give it a marketing advantage, technically it loses to many other cryptos,  even to Dogecoin -- because of its 10 minute **average** confirmation time.  

Even if it were to switch to 10 second interblock time (which may be politcally impossible), it would still not be good enough to compete with bank wires, Visa, PayPal, mPesa etc in their respective markets.

"> A proof of concept proves a concept that needs to be proven.

A proof of concept shows that something is feasible.

In your beer me example how does your app integrate with the existing POS system? How do you handle poor connectivity due to high cell traffic loads? How does the beer get delivered given the inaccuracy of GPS inside large buildings? Those are some of the more challenging aspects of your proposal and if I were considering funding you those would be the kinds of things I would want to see addressed in a proof of concept build.

If you told me they are obviously possible to implement I would put my checkbook away and invite you to call me when you had something working.

OP's claim that LN is not even at the proof of concept stage yet is 100% accurate because they _haven't solved routing_.

"That's interesting, I was wondering if the channels used on the hops would be required to update the status of their channel.

The whole thing sounds like it would be subject to all kinds of race condition problems, because the information about any change of state of a channel needs to propagate across the network. Another node could make a transaction using a channel that the first node already used, possibly just using the funds up in channel, so the first transaction can't be transmited.

It seems like the only way it could work reliably is to have some kind of time lock, so transactions would be held until all nodes had the same information.

"I have an additional worry personally. The whole model basically scraps the 6 confirmations model and makes people accept transactions that are unconfirmed as if they were confirmed. This is inherently insecure. There’s literally nothing stopping me creating a LN channel, purposefully put zero network fees on the transaction the channel runs on, deplete the funds, then let the channel close. I not only had people foolish enough to accept unconfirmed transaction as legit, but I run the very real possibility that that settled channel will remain in the mempool and end up being dropped, allowing me a free double spend! The best part is that I am incentivized in doing so, which means you can assume many people will do this, leading to further mempool bloat, thus making the attack even more successful. If a wise person being attacked decides to make a child transaction using the funds from the zero network fee transaction to get his money, he needs to pay the fee 3 times. It’s a great model.

On top of it, a whale can abuse the shit out of the network topology and force people to close their channel by pinpointing specific channels and sending them all one side. And since the whale can send to himself, he can make those attacks very cheaply.";6;3;False;manly_;dr87qlo;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

"To answer those questions:

1: You wouldn't use LN unless you plan on making three or more transactions over the channel. It's also possible (expected, really) for a channel to reach more than the people at the ends. Closing a channel is only necessary if the user wants to access the Bitcoin on the mainnet.

2a: LN can function as a mesh network and is designed to route around blockages. Nodes that charge excessive fees will be avoided in favor of nodes that are cheaper. With respect to KYC, I don't think it's enforceable on LN, in the same way that it's not enforceable on Bitcoin proper.

2b: The nature of this question suggests a serious misunderstanding of how LN works. LN channels are independent, and can close at any time without any consideration to any other channel. Nothing in this question is relevant.

3: In order:

* Channels can be funded by either or both of the participants. 
* LN channels can't be ""topped up"" in the usual sense. Interconnected node channels can be re-balanced, but the total amount in the channel is fixed.
* Some people will only need one channel. Others will have many to maximize their fee collection. I'd expect casual users will have one to three channels. No data behind that, mind, just my opinion.
* Due to the way LN routes payments, you won't need a channel to everyone you transact with. As long as one of your channels can find a route with sufficient funds, you're golden.
* Channels stay open until they are closed.
* A channel can be closed by either party whenever they want.
* You'd pay the closing fee when you need to use the Bitcoins outside LN, or when you don't want the channel open anymore for whatever reason.
* No, you won't need a 0.1 BTC channel for every Starbucks. Again, this part demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of how LN works.

4a: AFAIK channels won't close automatically, but you do have to be online to update the channel and monitor for fraud. So, practically speaking, being online is pretty much mandatory; I don't think there's much that can be done to change that. 

4b: All traffic should be encrypted, so blocking specifically LN traffic wouldn't really work. Plus, there's always Tor and/or VPN services to obfuscate traffic. Even if a node goes down permanently, no money is lost. Either party can close the channel and unlock the coins by broadcasting the last transaction to the Bitcoin network.";1;1;False;CatatonicMan;dr8u292;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.
