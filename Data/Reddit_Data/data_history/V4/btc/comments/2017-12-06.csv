I actually don't think it's a huge deal, because new sets of merchants will have woken up to crypto in the intervening years, and since BCH is all about scaling, unlike BTC, it shouldn't be an issue.

"'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'

Therefore, I don't see another coin ever limiting it's blocksize through a genuine consensus ever again in the same way BTC did. It's essentially scale or die. BTC did not scale properly, or in time, and it's damaging for crypto as a whole. Pretty much any other coin on the planet would have handled this scaling issue better, starting first with on-chain scaling and then in the face of real problems of larger blocks, considered moving to something else. It's absolutely unreal that a tiny 1MB block size wasn't even moved to 2MB and instead, a better option is to SegWit?!?!?

There's no fucking real reason for that apart from the reasons everyone here is familiar with. 1GB blocks have been tested and worked.

If someone now thinks 'right, it's time to make a decent crypto work again as a currency', the first thing is to make the blocks bigger, big enough to handle the load, and keep increasing them until other factors come into play that make the system too impractical. We're NO WAY NEAR that yet, even with 8mb, potential 32mb, and a working 1GB testnet.";435;17;False;LiamGaughan;dqv0skb;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

1. BTC currently has a limit of 7 transactions per second.  
    
2. High transaction fees due to the transaction congestion.

If that company had a limited number of trucks, then it's understandable that the price to put one gram of gold in that truck will increase the less space there is in the truck, because people who are willing to pay more will get their gold shipped first.

">What is the reason why the difficulty cannot be reduced to diminisg the hash power required to create transaction blocks?

That will happen, but that's not the point I'm making. I'm not suggesting that it will grind to a halt or anything, the difficulty will adjust and the blocks will keep being created at the same rate.  

The point, rather, is that the higher the hashpower, the higher the difficulty, the more 'work' is stored in the blockchain. This is what makes it resistant to attack, and therefore very reliable and trustworthy. The more work contributed, the greater the obstacle for a malicious miner to pervert the blockchain. 

Put simply, the less work put in by good miners to build the blockchain up to a point, the easier it is for a bad miner to 'overwrite' recent blocks by creating his own alternate and perfectly valid chain with more work. It's worth noting too that this doesn't necessarily need to be malicious, and the odds of even 'good' miners creating these miniforks increases as difficulty decreases and hash power fluctuates. 

If you want Bitcoin to be a store of value then, and useful in very high-value scenarios, this makes it non-viable. Now I'm not going to invest billions to create a longer competing chain so that the transaction for my coffee I just bought is cancelled, but such an action becomes more and more viable for a large corporation or government as hashpower decreases. A huge transfer of funds or even some kind of smart contract could be deliberately wiped from existence.

Even more plausible (inevitable, even) is that the number of confirmations required by any party using Bitcoin will rise and rise exponentially. This may be tolerable if you view Bitcoin as a store of value, but there is no denying that this is an objective decrease in the utility, convenience, and therefore value of Bitcoin.

>In that case couldn't bitcoin be sustained from the fees induced solely by the simple motion of wealth?

I'm not 100% sure what you're asking. If you're asking about when the block rewards stop leaving fees as the only thing incentivising miners, then that's the idea by design. 

It seems to me that an economy with many people making frequent, predictable, uniform transactions each with relatively low fees is more stable and dependable than one with very few transactions but with relatively large fees. If you're putting hundreds of millions into a mining investment, you're going to be putting them into the former where you *know* what % you'll be making, rather than the latter where sometimes you'll be eating electricity costs waiting for the times where you're raking in fees.

"Not really, since that's not exactly how a pyramid scheme works. Yes, some big whales can dump a shit ton of coins for USD, and make the market crash. The same can literally be said for any currency in the world if someone owned enough of us. It already happens with debt. China owns a shit ton of US debt, which can hard the economy. 

It has actual worth like any currency, right? I have an object, and you have a currency. I accept your currency (bitcoin), and hence it has value. Now, there are things that make Bitcoins value go up, but nothing that gives it direct value (think of when the USD used to be backed up by gold. It's not anymore. Similarly, Bitcoin doesn't have a central bank or gold backing it up. It's worth what people think its worth, just like any currency).

The wasted electricity from your computer is actually holding up the BTC network! It is validating transaction to ensure Bitcoin can get where it needs to go :)

That, and when people DID use bitcoin to pay for stuff it would create a support headache for Steam.

"Consider that Bitcoin is fundamentally different in that it *needs* to be used to be secure.

The fewer people using it, the fewer transactions, the fewer fees to incentivise miners, the less work contributed to the chain, the less secure it becomes. 

There is no analogous situation with gold; with gold, everyone *can* bury it or hide it in safes and it maintains its value (in fact, I'd argue that's even more secure than bringing gold out into the open to transact with).

As anyone who has ever sold anything in their life knows, quantity is better for revenue than forcing the price up. Better to have a lot of people creating transactions with relatively cheap fees than to impose artificial limits on transaction throughput to create a ""fee market"" with costs so high that people are consciously discouraged from using their currency at all for that very reason. Constant small fees are also more predictable and consistent than infrequent large ones, encouraging sound investment. 

For security it needs hash power, for hash power it needs miners, for miners it needs fees, for fees you need a lot of people willing and happy to create transactions.";7;1;False;BlacknOrangeZ;dqv5nqo;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

Fuck knows dude. I haven't bought BTC in a long time. I know i'm no great trader, I've invested in technology I have an interest in. I feel like buying BTC now is less of an investment in good technology, and more of a 'hope and pray' when it starts to come down, you can get out quick enough to have made a profit. I've gone to sleep, and woken up having missed 20% price increases in coins I was thinking about the night before, with 'I'll get some in the morning'. I wouldn't forget for a microsecond that the same thing could happen to BTC while I slept. It could cut right in half in price, coupled with all the exchanges crashing, the mempool being full... it's suicide. I have no plan to be part of that game so my cryptofolio is now not even 25% BTC. I didn't even want a portfolio when I started, I wanted to spend some fucking money on stuff I need and pay low transaction fees, and liked the idea of being my own bank. I spent 2 BTC on computer hardware in 2015 thinking 'surely it can't be more valuable than this'.... It's nice to see how it's value has gone up but there's no reason for it now that scaling has come to a standstill, merchant adoption decreases by the day, and that makes it too risky for me. I can't wait to actually use my TenX card day in day out once ETH comes out, and I would LOVE for them to support BCH next, but I'm not paying ridiculous BTC fees just to get the remaining coin to my TenX card. Convinced my lass to get a TenX card because she goes to germany and hates dealing with the EUR conversion... the fee was over a dollar to send $15 to the TenX wallet to order the card.... the first thing she did was ask me if that was correct. This was after we checked blockchain.info's suggested values for the slowest speed, and chopped it down further still using a custom fee.

Here's another idea, NATIONAL blockchains. Think about it. Do you really care about Chinese transactions, probably not, and they don't care about yours, either. Lets distribute the load to the servers in each country, this along with a blocksize increase, could get Bitcoin up to Visa speed with lower cost in a few weeks (!!) This ALREADY happened with the Internet. Yes, you can still .com, but you could also .US or .RU or .CN, these national addresses where an add on, THIS WAS A FORK of the INTERNET ITESELF. Maybe the BCH fork was the wrong fork (!!) Yes, you would split the mining revenue, but you could also make the mining easier mathematically, by a proportional amount, thus maintaining the pay-per-CPU-cycle. Then, if you needed to actually do an international transaction, you could do an international block transfer between the blockchains. Would that be more expensive and slower than a local trade ? Maybe, but those are a tiny share of most transactions, and the computational load between two countries would still be less than the current whole world blockchain, so it wouldn't matter 98% + of the time, and it would quickly fix a lot of bitcoin's problems, even including some subtle things, like energy use, and latency of transmissions. This would also paradoxically reduce the incentive for fraud, since you could only easily defraud your own countrymen, it would be less of a Reach our and loot some foreign other, like internet crime is now.;-20;1;False;triplewitching2;dqv3elc;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"> Wealth and credentials are not the same.

Put 10 programmers in a room and tell them to write X.  10 years later they will still be arguing about who gets to be top bill on the paper.

> His wealth doesn't measure his expertise.

There are a lot of geniuses who have dirty homes, live poor lives, who have no social skills.  Expertise at programming =/= knowing what is best for a currency.

What stood Satoshi apart was that he was indeed an economic visionary.  He saw the potential for Bitcoin when others couldn't fathom it.  And today, when core re-writes some bastard segwit coin they do so by saying that the white paper is flawed and we shouldn't rely on it.  Then, in the same breath they are outraged when you suggest that BCH, the coin described in the white paper, is called the REAL Bitcoin.

While Nakamoto was selling Bitcoin, more than 99% of the public and his peers thought he was nuts.  His vision into the future of Bitcoin was as large as  when David Bowie predicted in 1999 that the internet would have profound changes on how people live their lives (the internet would change out lives in ways we can't imagine).

"Bitcoin was cheap until it hit the 1mb limit.  No reason for fees to be where they are.

what is most comical is that core/blockstream have said that they want the fees high and have limited the block size to drive the fees up.  They said it themselves and then put out propaganda that this is not the cause of high fees.

**""Both sides of this debate get their money from the same source - transaction fees. Blockstream wants more transactions to flow through their proprietary service to collect more fees from institutions and individuals.""** (see below)

You couldn't make up a more twisted plot for a daytime soap opera.

Here, an r/bitcoin mod describes the situation well:

**""Blockstream is a for-profit company. As such, it is expected it will increase in value and, at least eventually, start generating revenue. While it had some projects that seem to be a money sink, the core business plan seems to still focus on sidechains - ""sell[ing] side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware"" (which the Blockstream CEO even explicitly confirmed). The original SegWit proposal was introduced by Blockstream's co-founder.**

**""So with this, we have a clear picture - Blockstream's revenue stream will come from off-chain transactions. Now, let's look at the other side of the debate.**

""Miners are paid directly in BTC by the blocks they mine. They mint new coins with each block, and they also collect fees for any transactions they include in that block. At the moment the block reward is 12.5BTC, and the fees add up to about 0.5 to 2 BTC on average. Pretty straightforward and as described in the original whitepaper.

**""So the miners are incentivised to include as many transactions in their blocks as they can, giving priority to those that pay more fees than the others per unit of size.**

""Clash of incentives

**""Both sides of this debate get their money from the same source - transaction fees. Blockstream wants more transactions to flow through their proprietary service to collect more fees from institutions and individuals.** The miners on the other hand benefit from more transactions taking place on the blockchain - they earn transaction fees only for the transactions that are included in the block and get nothing from off-chain transactions until they come back onto the chain. With finite amount of money flowing through the network, this is a classic zero-sum game - the more transactions flow through your preferred channel, the more money you have and the less money your opponent has.

""In an ideal scenario, we would let both of those options onto the free market and let the consumer choose what they want to use. Some would choose off-chain transactions for their speed, others would prefer on-chain transactions for the immutable records, etc. In a truly free market, the best product will win and the market will reach equilibrium. However, one side is currently at a disadvantage.

**""The size of the blocks is currently fixed at 1MB and SegWit has been activated on the network. This means that the miners have a finite amount of space to work with, while Blockstream and similar service providers don't have to do much to promote themselves - when the consumer will see on-chain transactions being too expensive for them and the blocks being full, they will by necessity make their way onto their platform to be able to transact.**

""Moreover, SegWit transactions have a smaller ""weight"" to them, meaning you can put more of them in a block and even go over the 1MB block limit with them.

""So we have a company that benefits from the traditional blocks being filled, while also giving preferential treatment to on board onto and off board from its proprietary services, while blocking others from increasing the overall throughput, all for ""the benefit of the consumer"". This is basically the Net Neutrality battle all over...""

Wouldn't all the miners of that pool have to agree, though, to be ready to include the tx? They wouldn't even have the txid yet.. so I'm trying to imagine how it would work. They have the private key, they look up the UTXOs and find the tx that includes them, and expedite it. Idk.. I expect if it's a high enough profile PR stunt, some miners might do this, but I wonder how many. Can a pool operator trick miners into doing this?

The credit cards make about 2% + 0.25 on transactions, so for small transactions they can make 6% or more.  Many stores don't let you use credit cards for sizes below $5 as a result.   When they give you cash-back of 2%, usually those are points or miles, and the credit buys in bulk those points or miles for only about 20 cents on the dollar.  I prefer cards that give cash back not points/miles, and usually those only give 1% back.;1;1;False;geezorious;dquwccs;I'm giving away $100 each of BCH and BTC on live TV tomorrow by displaying the private key.

Yup, only 18 months to 100% right?

> Please don't get emotional. It's beyond stupid to say LN is fake and will never exist when there are hard working people improving it...

I'm not emotional.  I watched the video from years ago, it was a lot of ""ifs and buts"" and when I posted the video I was berated that, ""It was a long time ago, we've solved those issues.""  
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bx7w2/you_will_remember_im_a_project_manager_by_trade_i/dplqa93/

We can see from Adam ""Tab"" Back that this is not reality:

https://streamable.com/ilh2d

When you look at the logistics of what it will take to run LN you can see that it will be problematic, expensive, slow, etc.  No, it is not emotional, it is pragmatic.

**LN is a fraud and WILL NEVER WORK AS ADVERTISED.**

And so, please don't come back and say how good its ""going to work.""  Come back when you have a transaction and share it with us.  Because, in reality, you're arguing that your ""theory"" is going to work out just fine.  You don't know that your theory will work at all.

">The original joke was that, since fees are ""rising"", xenodochial wants to invest in them. (Which is of course nonsense, which makes it funny.)

It really isn't when you think about it. Blockstream's entire business model involves creating high fees to force tx fees offchain to their proprietary products. They've explicitly stated this in various forms, like from pwuille and Ben Davenport (Bitgo). So if you want to invest in high fees you invest in either company (Blockstream or Bitgo) , or any of the other core dev created businesses that have banked their futures on high fees that can be siphoned away from miners offchain.

A guy who purports himself to be an expert on bitcoin and has written a book about mastering bitcoin doesn't own any bitcoin?  He writes:

“THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BITCOIN IS FORGETTING THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF OPENNESS, DECENTRALIZATION AND PRIVACY. IF WE ABANDON THOSE PRINCIPLES, THEN BITCOIN WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS THOSE PRINCIPLES. THE NATIONAL CURRENCIES AND BANKING SYSTEMS ARE RAPIDLY HEADING TOWARDS TOTALITARIAN CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE. WE NEED A SAFE HAVEN ALTERNATIVE TO BIG-BROTHER-MONEY. “

Ver called him out saying that he has no skin in the game.  The r/bitcoin crowd - using pc speak - call this ""poor shaming.""  That's what we're talking about.

Did he poor shame the guy or challenge his credentials as a ""bitcoin expert?""

If you don't think that the inability to spend bitcoin is a problem, you're no expert.  This is what Ver said and I agree.  To turn it into a proletariat versus bourgeois conflict is disingenuous.

If you disagree with Ver's conclusion that he isn't as expert at Bitcoin as he believes, then challenge that.  But to try to drum up emotional currency with the term ""poor shaming"" is sad.

"Bitcoin is to be the public ledger and has the infrastructure in place.  It was built to do so, it can scale to do so, so what is the problem?

So when do you think Bitcoin will scale to VISA levels? When do you think we will have that demand? The legacy coin will never get there, but I can see BCH getting there in a decade.

Now, let's go with your claim of 100GB blocks, it is inflated but whatever. 376GB blocks have been tested.  If you were doing it today, you would need a node that costs $20,000, for the 376GB Block.

That level of use, would indicate a value several thousand times greater than BCH is today.  Now some uninformed individual laughed at the idea of $100,000 or million dollar coins, because I guess they were not around when we were planning to replace entire economies with Bitcoin, but that is the bottom floor of what you are talking.

In a decade, that $20,000 computer will be at least a tenth of the cost, more likely a hundredth and possibly even less.  I am not a Gartner fan and their magic quadrants, but I would say with 80% certainty that the Raspberry Pi equivalent of 2027, will be able to handle terabyte blocks without much issue.

So why do we need Lightning? What problem will it solve?

As for Ethereum, what I see is people reacting to, what amounts to the average backlog in Bitcoin these days, and saying that something needs to be done.  If they had Core problems, they would be told it is because of SPAM attacks, that there are no problems, that they need to restrict scaling and wait for a few years until an unproven, unworkable, centralized creation can be pulled into existence.  Thankfully they are not ignorant and broken, like the Core contingent, and will improve Ethereum so it will further dwarf the legacy coins transaction volume.

"Your video is misleading.  It shows a low cost to open or close a channel from the blockchain, which is not reflective of the current median fee.  It doesn't mention the time or hassle to find a node/hub that is also connected to the recipient (Starblocks).

The median BTC fee is $3.85 currently. Using this number, opening and closing a LN channel means that $7.70 of fees will be paid to the miners.  Let’s use $3.85 to be conservative (even though fees are rising).

Let’s say hypothetically that Visa or Paypal charges $1 per transaction. This means that Alice and Carol would need to do 4 or more LN transactions, otherwise it would be cheaper to use Visa or Paypal.

But it gets worse.  Visa doesn’t charge $1 per transaction.  They charge 3%, which is 9 cents on a $3 cup of coffee.  Therefore, no one is going to use BTC and LN to buy coffee unless 2 things happen:

1.  they buy more than 43 cups of coffee from the same store ($3.85 divided by 9 cents)

2.  they know ahead of time that they will do this with that same store

This means that if you’re ever traveling or want to tip content producers on the internet, you will likely never use BTC and LN.  If you and your spouse want to try out a new restaurant, you will not use BTC and LN.  If you buy shoes, you will not use BTC or LN.

If Alice wants to make only one purchase at a retail store, or Alice only wants one purchase from Carol, then she would never use BTC, with or without LN.

Try to use some critical thinking.  

Small blocks, high fees and slow confirmations creates the need for off-chain products, such as Lightning.  Lightning generates traffic and fees for exchanges, which increases demand for Liquid.  Blockstream sells Liquid to exchanges, and this is the main way that Blockstream will be able to generate revenue and provide a return to their investors, who have invested $76 million.

The majority of businesses, miners and users wanted bigger blocks for 4 years.  To simply keep smaller blocks, Blockstream simply insisted on consensus.  Since Blockstream kept rejecting, there was no consensus and no block size increase.

> We did decide on a blocksize increase and got it months ago.

Yes, because no one uses Bitcoin Cash.  It's like Bitcoin was 8 years ago, still in the ""free"" phase.  Any coin that gets popular will run in to scaling problems.  Just look at Ethereum right now too.  Fees are rising fast and confirmation times are getting slower and slower despite dynamic block sizes.

A more salient question might be why isn't BCH called BTC?  It's much closer to Satoshi's original vision, it's the same chain, it has competent developers who get things done instead of bicker among themselves for years and achieve nothing, its completely usable instead of completely broken.

"Dude, while we have your attention...

People associate you with BCH because you defend it, even though as far as I know other than financial interest in the way of invested assets and belief in the technology. Can you confirm you are not involved in actual development or have a stake on any of the dev teams?

Also, why did you attack Andreas seemingly out of the blue?

"It is really quite simple.  Some banks don't want Bitcoin to scale - they want to hold it back while they bring in other coins (Iota comes to mind) that they can control and profit from.  If they don't completely kill Bitcoin, they want to tax it.

And so, they've bought off the programmers who refuse to raise the block limit, the system is congested and prices (and wait times) are shooting through the roof.  It is EASILY solved by raising the block size limit.

The company that is in the center of this, Blockstream, has openly stated that it is their desire to have HIGH Bitcoin fees so that they can present off-chain solutions and charge for them.  Unfortunately, their ""solution"" in the form of a Lightning Network is always ""18 months away.""  In the meantime, bitcoin has lost about 50% of its market share.

A bunch of folks changed the programming of Bitcoin back to its original founder's design and this other form of Bitcoin is called Bitcoin Cash.

One has bigger recognition but higher fees and longer confirmation times.

"I still follow both subreddits & own both coins but I think BCH has a different niche.  BCH seems much better suited for the minor $5 transactions.  

BTC seems better fit for someone looking to move $200M from undeclared Russian accounts over to domestic.  

Earlier today I withdrew $2000 worth of BTC from Coinbase into my own wallet.  The tx fee total was $3.46.  Seems pretty reasonable to me, but idk. 

I will continue to follow both subreddits and hold/acquire more of both cryptos.  I think in some sense, the fighting is silly because we are on the same team.

">It cost me $178 ($78 in fees) to load the $100 in BTC onto the address.

What exactly did you do to pay that much? 

I am not a huge fan of BTC, but to pay 178$ for 100$ in BTC requires a lot of willful ignorance.

Also 

>The person claiming the BTC will only receive about $25 of the $100

Does this mean there is 25$ in BTC or that you expect that a person with the private key to 100$ can only transfer 25$?

Bit misleading there, friend. The real transactioncosts for BTC are bad enough, there is no need to lie about them.

I later came to my senses and realized BTC's on-chain capacity is capped (despite SegWit and possible 2x at the time), and it is only a matter of time for BCH on-chain liquidity to grow.

It reminds me of the former [U.S. housing market crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble). Banks were investing in shitty bonds (CDOs), not knowing what was inside, which lead to the housing market collapse. And now compare it with legacy bitcoin (trading at $14150). 

-

Legacy Bitcoin's current underlying foundation is 

- 1 MB block size, which limits and prices out many users from bitcoin, 
- high and unpredictable fees 
- slow confirmation times
- having now 126000 [unconfirmed txs](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions), 
- a 230 MB mempool, 
- commercial use cases are dying left and right (e.g., Steam),
- and folks are investing into vaporware and  ""store of value"" coin that only works with centralized entities like exchanges and LN hubs.

**With all the flaws mentioned above, is legacy bitcoin really $14150 worth** 🤨**?**

You don't fully control your bitcoins anymore! That's not bitcoin anymore, a **P2P** electronic cash system! We are literally creating new banks here! 

-

IMO, an explosive thing that currently grows.

"Again, anyone can open a channel, just like anyone can open a wallet/bank. That’s the beauty of it all. 

As you pointed out a single entity would probably not fund a channel for every amazon customer. Simply too expensive. But many entities can do it.

"Since the August hard fork, Bitcoin (BTC) has changed its procedures, it has developed, investor confidence has grown, the community has grown, etc. It is now a completely different coin to BCH.

When investors invest in Bitcoin, they are investing in the coin which went from $2k to $12k in 4 months. They are investing in the coin which millions upon millions have gone into. They are investing in BTC.

To just state ""oh well. The name is free to take!"" Completely betrays investment integrity, and is tantamount to fraud, as it causes huge confusion between the two entities.

But at least you admit it. Ver wants the brand to boost up BCH's value. ";0;1;False;Fickle_Monster;dquf6nr;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"The only reason why Ver took huge offence to BCH being called Bcash is because it took away the Bitcoin in the name - that's literally it.

If he believes in the tech, the team, and the community, he wouldn't care if it's called Bitcoin or not. He shouldn't feel the need to attack Bitcoin, yet he does. Why? Because he wants the brand.";1;1;False;Fickle_Monster;dque8i3;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"Of course he wants the brand, everyone wants the brand, that's by far the biggest asset of Bitcoin. 

The real question here is whether bitcoin cash should care about it and whether it has the right to it. Which is a pretty big subject on it's own right but a lot of people would say yes, it has every right to the name as per free software philosphy and bitcoin philosophy itself. And it should care about the name because it gives so much value to the coin not to mention the fact that you could argue that bitcoin cash is more of a bitcoin than btc itself as it follows technical paper more closely.

"It takes decency to not blow up, attack a person's business, blow your own horn, flip someone off, then rage quit.

All that was said was that there's nothing wrong with calling Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, and that Ver hires sock puppets.

He can disagree with both without being a child.";1;0;False;Fickle_Monster;dquc8d0;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"I don't know, you would have to be really ignorant to not know that ""bcash"" is an offensive term and really unprofessional to not be able to avoid using it.  

Even if it was an innocent mistake, wouldn't you apologise and admit the mistake instead of making up excuses and claiming it's not a big deal. It's like ""I'm sorry but I'm not sorry"" kind of apology, which is really unprofessional (though in all fairness Roger Ver is guilty of this sorry not sorry in his own right but that's a seperate issue). 

My point being is that it really sucks to be an average joe crypto-currency supporter because the medium is just so volatile and unwelcoming, and ""interviews"" like this just prove my point.";1;1;False;Farkeman;dqudq1q;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"Didn't the interviewer refer to BCH as Bitcoin Cash many times more than he referred to it as BCash? The interviewer himself says he doesn't mean to do it, but it's just something he is accustomed to.
