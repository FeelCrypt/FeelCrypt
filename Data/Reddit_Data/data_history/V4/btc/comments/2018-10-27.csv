"In certain expressions, when the noun has a gradeable meaning (EDIT: or used as a determiner before a noun phrase to add emphasis) the indefinite article is dropped e.g. such lovely weather.... such lovely countryside....such unfunny meme....

 When you quickly type something on the computer you tend to take shortcuts and don't focus too much on grammar or spelling. Maybe it wasn't the most elegant expression but accusing somebody of ""broken"" english because of that and saying they wouldn't understand this boring and terrible meme  is utter bullshit and a bad comeback.

I am not asian but I am also not from an english speaking country. However, I do have american relatives that I basically grew up with. They can never tell that I am not american by the way I speak.";1;1;False;themadscientistt;e8jippq;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg
Well, it would be interesting to see how fast this meme got its upvotes. If the upvotes came unnaturally fast it would make brigading very plausible.;1;0;False;themadscientistt;e8jiyjk;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg
"You were missing the word ""an."" Don't know if you're actually foreign, but I've had some Asian friends that make the mistake of leaving out ""a"" or ""an"" fairly frequently, particularly if they are talking quickly.";1;1;False;JustShortOfSane;e8j42ww;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg
I'm not the guy who called it broken English, just pointing out why he probably saw it thay way, or what he was trying to draw from at least.;1;0;False;JustShortOfSane;e8k95ct;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg
