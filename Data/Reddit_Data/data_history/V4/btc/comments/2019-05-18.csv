Correct. The humor of this picture is that it is an image of something that doesn't scale. This is what a world with electricity using DC would look like. Edison was pushing this approach. Tesla pushed for AC. It scaled nicely. Bitcoin is the ac of blockchains. It scales by pushing most of the congestion problem into a second layer. Sort of like AC pushes the wire congestion into sub stations. Additionally, AC pushes the wire congestion problem into the home where much of the AC power is converted to DC (ever wonder why your computer has that giant box between it and the plug?). Bitcoin cash looks like the picture above. It's infrastructure doesn't scale. The network itself takes on the burden of bigger blocks.

The growth of the backbone routing tables in the late 90's was a big problem, and yes, we came close to the limits (mainly RAM) of the hardware that was widely deployed.  But this was averted  by a combination of changes to the way address space was managed and, of course, improvements in hardware - and the growing populatity of the Internet, which made it commercially viable to deploy new hardware.

EDIT: I've no idea though whether Robert Metcalf declared that the end of the Internet was nigh, but he may well have done.
