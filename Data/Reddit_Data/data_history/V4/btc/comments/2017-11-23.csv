The fact that you submit stuff like https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cmq4g/how_did_core_get_ownership_of_bitcoinsegwit/ for example.

If you want to understand why I'm skeptical, look at this post from today: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7esv1h/where_are_all_the_gazillion_trolls_and_shills/ I think my answer is the only one which is not about nonsense conspiracy, it might not be a good answer, but at least it tries to answer the actual question, and yet it is the most downvoted one, compared to all the other conspiracy bullshit answers. It's just an example that any attempt to talk without any conspiracy or politic in this sub is now useless. I'm sure you'll understand that people might think their time is better spent elsewhere.

"I am not exactly sure what ""artificially high fees"" means, or how we could define ""artificial"" objectively in that context, so... no, I am not trying to argue that.

The paper shows that a backlog of pending, fee-paying transactions in the mempool is a sign of *health* in the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin works because of how the economic incentives are aligned. Miners' greed allows the network to function autonomously. It would be wonderful if we could achieve everything that Bitcoin achieves through sheer altruism, but that's not a realistic assumption to rely upon, unfortunately.

"Yes, the central claim of the paper is that when this inevitably happens, Bitcoin is not stable *unless* there is a continual backlog of transactions (with accompanying fees) waiting to be processed. Without such a backlog, the rational (most profitable) mining strategy becomes to ""re-mine"" any block that managed to capture meaningful fees, *rather than building on top of it and extending the chain*.

In other words, when the block reward diminishes to a small enough value (**which is 100% inevitable by design**), it stops providing sufficient incentives to reliably grow the blockchain. Satoshi's answer to this problem was ""transaction fees will provide this incentive"" but the paper demonstrated that they can only reliably do so if *the mempool regularly contains a backlog of pending transactions with meaningful fees attached*.

">Your argument says nothing about the current case, when mining rewards don't have to be dominated by transaction fees.

About 80% of **all BTC that will ever exist** have already been mined. When do you believe the transition to a fee-centric paradigm should begin, at what rate should the transition occur, and do you have any formal academic analysis to support your reasoning?

I am happy to hear out any long-term plans that people have in mind, but in my experience they usually don't have *any* other than ""Let's just think of the short term for now, and cross the other bridges as they come!"" If you are the exception, if you've put actual thought into this and have meaningful arguments for what you think the timetables should look like on how this all plays out, I'm all ears. I suspect this isn't the case, though.

I really, **really** recommend reading [The Hardest Logic Puzzle In The World](https://xkcd.com/solution.html) and spending a good amount of time making sure you understand the answer and why it is the answer. I promise that it is not irrelevant to our discussion here, and you don't have to do it right now or anything.

Efficient markets (at least should) work like the logicians in that puzzle, in that *if* something will be worth a certain value at a certain point in the future, and this can be known (and demonstrated) with certainty, the price will converge on that value *in the present*. Or, to be more accurate, the price will converge on a value in the present which reflects that future value after you factor in the time value of money (but that's not particularly important for the point at hand). This means that *if* Bitcoin would suddenly stop working in 2140, and the whole thing breaks down, and we can logically realize this today, then its value should go to zero *starting now*.

That's why it was important for Satoshi to specify an incentive that exists even when the coinbase rewards vanish (or drop to negligible levels): transaction fees. It is an elegant solution, and seems to give us a means for Bitcoin to continue working for as far as you care to extrapolate forward (at least, *a priori*).

So you can't simply say ""We have the block rewards now, let's not worry about fees while they are still 'pretty big' because we don't have to."" We *do* have to. And we're rapidly approaching the point where big block rewards are no longer a given.

>Bitcoin has the power to change that.

I'm the most optimistic person I know, and I certainly hope you're right, but ""Don't worry, Bitcoin is magic!"" isn't a good enough argument to convince most people or convince the market.

I'm not trying to make a strawman argument here, by the way. It really does seem like you're saying ""Bitcoin has powers we don't understand."" It's an argument based on an appeal to magic, as far as I can see.

>Whenever people make the argument that ""this cannot work because it requires people to not act selfishly"" or similar, it implies 1 of 2 things: 1) a defeatist attitude about the inherent goodness of man or 2) they themselves want to act selfishly. Which of these are you?

I think this is a false dichotomy, but if you force me to choose, I choose 1. 

Bitcoin is built so that it survives *even in adversarial conditions*, and it achieves this by relying on the inherent greed of Man. That's the beauty of it, in fact. Once you start trying to remove this quality of it, you are *trying to weaken Bitcoin* and effectively trying to reduce it from antifragile to fragile.

I, for one, will oppose that effort with all of my might.

OP's a core developer so I'm sure he's not talking shit. Anyway, Bitcoin is a high fee environment at the moment because transactions are happening on-chain and the block-size is limited. OP was saying it's not a technical problem if the mempool is huge, he wasn't talking about it not being an attribute to high fees. The plan to scale bitcoin is to kick payments up a layer or two. If you are using bitcoin for payments on the blockchain level (your only option at the moment) then I agree, fees are two high for it to be practical for low payments. Also blocks take on average 10 minutes to confirm. It's a pretty slow and shitty payment system if you have to wait 10 minutes. Sometimes a lot more. Come back in a year or three when some new layers are rolled out, they ought to be instant and practically free. For now bitcoin is a good but highly experimental store of value.

You can replace any transaction so long as you pay for it. Doesn't have to be the exact same outputs. Doesn't have to be the same output amounts, and in fact increasing the fee necessarily decreases the amount of one or more  of the outputs.

"Right, that's why I said up to 90 days, or whatever the contract states.

Then the point was made that you'd need to camp out for months to get a similar amount of certainty with a credit card transaction. You seem to be saying that a credit card transaction is instantly ""confirmed"" whereas a Bitcoin transaction is ""confirmed"" after it makes it into a block. My point is that those two usages of the word ""confirm"" are so radically different that it isn't fair to compare them.

I think that a credit card approval (not sure if it really even is called a confirmation in the industry) is roughly equivalent to a zero conf BTC transaction if you wait a few minutes and check a few other nodes in the network, whereas a single confirmation on the BTC network is roughly equivalent to ""having the money"" from a cc transaction.

"This was an advert for TenX that aired yesterday, although annoyingly they never actually mentioned the company behind the tech. You will note that at 0.21 he is showing the wallet app on his phone. Here is a [larger version](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIib9GsWsAQybWN.jpg) (not from the video and not my image) With TenX you have a debit card that hold multiple crypto's including Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin and other ERC20 (DGX, REP, TRUST, NEO, etc.) tokens.
You pay for things using the debit card as you would a standard debit card and the payment is instant. (no waiting for the next block etc to confirm payment) The app shows you how much you currently have in EUR/GBP to spend and when you pay using the card the wallet app will update instantly.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdyC_QEqN1U) showing it in action. There are plenty of user videos out there as well. Worth looking into. The team are always keeping the users and investors up to date with how things are going with the tech.

"> BCH still has very apparent limitations that, as far as I can see, make it impractical for making most purchases in shops. 

What are those exactly? (Outside of those encounterd by all crypto, because it's crypto)

>Right now solutions like Dash's InstantX, or lightning network, seem to be far more applicable to real world use cases to me, instead of just speculative investment.

There was never a need to choke the on-chain transactions the way it played out, just to make SegWit/Lightning Network an option. If these technologies are so revolutionary, they are free to come play with the rest of us in an uncensored un-artificially capped environment, I'm sure. But for the near future, simply increasing the blocksize has helped BCH immensely with usability and solved a lot of issues for the frustrated many, who just want to use Bitcoin as a currency, like intended in the whitepaper. Maybe when 32mb blocks become full and fees are high on BCH, SegWit will prove itself to be scientifically the most effective method of increasing transaction throughput compared to any other tech that gets developed, or simply increasing the blocksize further.... However, I don't think it will be and there's already other options being developed like this

https://youtu.be/LDF8bOEqXt4?t=4100

and experiments with much larger 1GB block sizes. To me that is two good paths to scaling being covered, while in the meantime the on-chain capacity of BCH is working well for those who want to use it. Looking to the future is good, but what good is a future built on a broken system.... just my opinion of course.";1;1;False;LiamGaughan;dq8puoj;Man buys coffee with Bitcoin in 2017;7ez93l;https://v.redd.it/tomvg4fqupzz

You're right about that. The reason Bitcoin Core is now useless for this kind of transaction is not the waiting time for block inclusion or 6 blocks but the ridiculous fees.

Don't you realize that hundreds of thousands of people are casually reading rbitcoin for information on Bitcoin, and _basing their investment decisions off what they see there?_ Bitcoin has gone from $1000 to $8000 in a year, and with that price increase, hundreds of thousands of people are going there to learn about it. People who browse rbitcoin casually have no idea what's going on, or that the narrative is completely manipulated towards those who support a very specific path. I'm not asking reddit to take sides. What I'm asking is that they simply make it a place where discussion about the topic (Bitcoin) is allowed, from all sides. The mods there are also, in all likelihood, hacking/manipulating users' accounts, which is a very grave sitewide violation. Bitcoin is much bigger than reddit or some niche topic. It's money that belongs to the world, and a handful of manipulative forum mods are doing a wonderful job of abusing their positions to turn the world's most popular discussion channels into propaganda outlets. That's basically what rbitcoin is now. It's a propaganda machine for the [Blocktream corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream).

"> Moderate inflation doesn't discourage people from accepting a currency.

Sure, because practically speaking, the fact that your extremely easy to pour bucket has a small, slow leak isn't enough to make you abandon it for day-to-day transactional purposes when the only other options are buckets that are much harder to pour.  At least over the short term, the network effect is almost everything (and a small network effect translates to a very difficult to pour bucket). Also consider that the government has a very heavy thumb on the scale when it comes to the market for money. Taxes are payable exclusively in a nation's fiat. Legal tender laws also place fiat in a privileged position. And would-be money competitors are further disadvantaged by things like the requirement to pay tax on capital gains when trading (e.g.) precious metals that may have appreciated in value (even if those ""gains"" are only an artifact of fiat's depreciation). 

>When you examine examples of Greshams law in real life, you see the opposite of what you suggest would happen.

I don't think Gresham's law applies.  From the wikipedia entry: ""In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that 'bad money drives out good'. For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, **which are accepted by law as having similar face value,** the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.""

>Not taking up resources isn't an act that creates value. Dead people also don't take up resources, they're not producing any value. 

The key is not taking up resources *when you have an immediately exercisable claim that would allow you to do so.* To make it a bit more concrete, here's an example I've used before:

Imagine a high school kid that mows 50 lawns over the summer to earn enough to buy a used car.  The ""real"" economic exchange there is 50 mowed lawns for 1 used car.  Money is just the medium of exchange that makes it possible for that trade to occur across multiple parties and across time.  (Barter would be a little trickier given the difficulty of finding a guy who a) has the car you want to buy; b) wants to sell it; and c) has 50 lawns that need mowing.) Now imagine that the kid decides not to immediately buy the used car but to instead wait a year.  Well, he has now given value for which he has yet to receive any kind of real satisfaction.  (The green pieces of paper in his wallet are obviously not what he really wants.) And that also means that someone else gets to enjoy the use of that car for another year.  The kid has thus effectively *loaned* the value of his services as represented by that car to society.  That's why it makes sense to me that money's purchasing power should increase over time.  Deflation is simply the ""interest"" on a kind of low-risk loan.

Also consider that instead of simply deferring the car's purchase for a year, he could have bought the car immediately and then loaned it out to someone for rental income.

>The best you can be talking about is a zero-sum transfer of wealth to other people, since taking money out of supply helps deflate the supply and increase the unit value.

Saving money does represent a transfer of purchasing power to other people (those who decide to spend now), but it's not zero sum because those two groups obviously have different preferences.  

>Why invest in a new form of production that makes 5% return if simply sitting on your money makes 6%?

Well you shouldn't. If we're assuming a fixed-supply money, what does that 6% price deflation number tell you?  It tells you that there must be lots of investment opportunities with a return of *at least* 6%.  Basically, that's the number to beat.  If you're looking at an investment opportunity with a measly 5% return, deflation is telling you not to waste your time because there are higher and better uses of that capital.

">The kid has thus effectively loaned the value of his services as represented by that car to society. That's why it makes sense to me that money's purchasing power should increase over time. Deflation is simply the ""interest"" on a kind of low-risk loan.

This is a well constructed, logically valid example but its built on what I think I can demonstrate is a false premise and so leads to a false conclusion.

It assumes that if you buy a car, that means one less car for everyone else in the world, so by not redeeming your cash for a car you are somehow *loaning* the value of that car (or anything else you could buy) to the world until you decide to claim it. Except cars aren't fixed resources, they're produced. 

Buying a car doesn't reduce the availability of cars, it increases it, because for every one car you buy, the manufacturer makes enough money to build 2 or 3 new cars. They can also use that money to improve their factories, which makes cars even cheaper (meaning people have even more money to buy other goods and services that generate yet more wealth).

Not spending money is actually decreasing the availability of cars in terms of opportunity cost. If you don't buy the car, there's only 1 car available and it does no good to anyone whilst waiting to be sold. Once bought, the car can provide value to you, as well as allowing the manufacturer to make more cars, making cars available to several more people.

Trade is a virtuous cycle, which is why high velocity of money is desirable in a currency and hoarding is not.

There are more fundamental reasons why not spending money isn't equivalent to loaning its value to the world, even in a zero sum world, (i.e. the car is no more available if you refuse to claim it than if you just never did the work in the first place, or worked for free, so there is no opportunity cost), but since we don't live in a zero-sum world its not necessary to go into that level of detail.

Moneys only value is to facilitate trade. There is no way for it to generate value doing nothing, because there's no difference between burying money in a vault for a trillion years and just burning it. The only way doing nothing can seem to generate value is zero-sum wealth transfer by increased demand for money which comes about from reduced supply by people taking money out of circulation. This is rent seeking behavior, which rewards people for economic inactivity.

The Catholic University of America (CUA) is a private university located in Washington, D.C. in the United States. It is a pontifical university of the Catholic Church in the United States and the only institution of higher education founded by the U.S. Catholic bishops. Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by Pope Leo XIII on Easter Sunday, the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904. The university's campus lies within the Brookland neighborhood, known as ""Little Rome"", which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including Trinity Washington University and the Dominican House of Studies.
