"> No rational actor will take their $1000 and put in into a system that doesn't allow them to easily and quickly withdraw all $1000.

What are you on about? If you want to take out your $1000, you close your channels, pay the transaction fees, and remove the $1000 minus anything you have spent while the channels were open. 

The issue you have is that you have multiple channels open, which means your purchasing power is dispersed through the network - so you cannot lump all your channels together to spend on one big purchase.

"> As I understand it, the answer to this question is as follows:
1 + x + x(x-1) + ... + x(x-1)n
This is a hard upper bound, given a maximum node degree of x for the entire graph and a hop limit of n. This bound can be achieved by a tree topology rooted on the source node. Such a topology will not provide the required capability for arbitrary source nodes, as it has to be engineered for the benefit of a specific node. However, if one is prepared to double the hop limit then arbitrary nodes can connect to arbitrary nodes. (There are a range of tradeoffs between x and n for a given size network. Two extremes involve a cyclic graph where every node is of degree 2 or less and the hops is half the number of nodes and a fully connected graph, where hops is 1 and each node is of degree one less than the number of nodes.)

"> Once I've locked up my $1000 in LN, it no longer is practical for me to spend all of it.

It is not practical to spend all of it, in one go, in one single transaction. The whole purpose of setting up the channels is because you DIDN'T want to spend all of it, it one go, in one transaction. 

The whole purpose of LN is to afford multiple bi-directional, continuos transactions over the time period once a channel is open. 

If you think rational actors would not tie up $1000 in a LN channel if they expected their total ins and outs (a multitude of transactions to a multitude of agents in multiple time stamps) over a certain time period to total somewhere in the region of +- $1000 then ok, so be it.

"> Please help me correct my misunderstanding .

Firstly, i am not an expert on this, so can only give you a scenario that i envisage. Your vision at this stage, is just as valid as mine. The only 'working' product i have seen in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNFfUfyL2xE). 

However, the way i see it - you would never want to make a payment on LN that equates to all the money you have tied up in channels. It wouldn't make sense. This would be opposed to the reason the channel existed in the first place (which is to afford continuous bi-directional transactions to take place over set time period with a number of peers). 

In your example, if your $1000 is on a channel to one hub (lets say Poloniex for example). 

All that money is tied up in that channel until it is closed. 
I accept that. 

But now, all your ins and outs are routed through that channel for small transactions. 

So you might pay Ebay $10. 
You might pay Starbucks $5. 
You pay Verizon $10. 

You are now $25 down on that channel. 

However, your friend Bob wants to pay you $15 he owes you for beers the other night. 

He does this through his own channel to Poloniex, which is one hop to you. 

The next day you sell something on eBay and the seller owes you $10. 

They pay you through LN, and it is again routed through Poloniex as they have an open channel to them as well. 

In total you have spent $25, and received $25 into your channel. 

Yes, Poloniex is a central hub - but that is because you have chosen not to open anymore channels. 

If you had not put $1000 into one channel, you may well have been able to open up a channel to your friend Bob, one to the eBay seller, From those two nodes, you may have been able to hop to Starbucks and Verizon as and when you needed.

It is a give and take system. As you 'lend', you will also 'borrow'. There should be a state of equilibrium reached (but yes, i am not sure how long this will take, or how it will be optimised - this is the most difficult part of the whole thing).

It isn't an exact mirror of legacy systems  - but admittedly does borrow concepts. I will give you this.

"> Why would I want to lock little bits of my money all over the place, fragmenting my purchasing power?

You see, this is the crux. You are not fragmenting your power, as you will also benefit from other channels (as long as there are peers that you can leverage transaction from). It is a give and take system - which should (though this is theoretical) reach some equilibrium state, in which there is a constant flow of money.

You wouldn't need to tie up all your money - just enough to cover the temporal term of your channel, and the money you intend to spend on average for that period +- ~10% on micro-transactions/small transactions.

Much like people set up limits on how much they will store on an exchange or payment service such as PayPal.

> As you 'lend', you will also 'borrow'.

True, but the 'borrow' half does not cancel lost spending power nor provide additional spending power to participants; it simply emerges as a necessity to maintain equilibrium. The protocol itself is doing the borrowing and repaying to maintain balances; participants are funding the system, initiating the procedure of transacting, and providing required liquidity to the protocol.

Distributed security, which is significantly different from personal security.

> Even now, mempool size it is far less than it has been before. I am not entirely sure why, but it is definitely less.

That is expected, in any network or channel.  

A permanent backlog is a practical impossibility.  It would mean that some transactions are never confirmed.  The people who issued them would give up on bitcoin.  Ditto if there are transactions that take a week or more to confirm.  Whenever there is a large backlog, the demand (incoming traffic) will drop, until it is less than the capacity and the backlog clears.

This feedback mechanism will keep the incoming traffic, when averaged over a month or more, always somewhat below the capacity of the network; say 90% of it.  Then random variations in the demand will cause sporadic backlogs that last days, separated by periods without backlogs.  The backlogs will be just bad enough to prevent the demand from growing further.

> if you accept that transaction fees won't always be $2 a transaction, this removes one of the centralisation forces.

If sanity returns, the block size limit will be lifted to a value that makes it irrelevant, like 100 MB.  Then on-chain transaction fees will again be a few cents -- the cost plus a reasonable profit -- and the LN will lose most of its reason to exist.

But even if the LN were to exist, and channel opening fees were low, there would be a dis-incentive to open more than one channel -- namely, the inconvenience of having one's coins split between two or more channels.

Consider again that scenario where you have 10 channels, funded with 1 BTC in each direction.  The maximum payment you could send would be $2, if you have one channel that is saturated with a $1 balance towards you.  

(If you don't have it, you could create such a situation by sending yourself an LN payment through a path that starts with one channel and ends with a chosen channel, one or more times, until that chosen channel is saturated towards you.  But anyway you will need more than one LN payment to send those $2 to the intended destination.)

Note also that you cannot assume that channels will be created or closed every time they are needed, e.g. in that situation.  The LN will be a scaling solution only if each channel is used, on the average, for hundreds of payments.  If the average user makes two payments per day, the average channel lifetime must be at least a couple of months.  

That in fact must be the hidden reason why Blockstream is so desperate to keep the 1 MB limit.  The LN cannot start small and grow by attracting users with its qualities.  It will not be viable if users are forced to close channels all the time in order to do on-chain payments to bitcoin users who are not in the LN.  It must be a ""closed"" bitcoin economy; meaning that practically all bitcoin users are forced to switch to it, right from the start.

This is incorrect I think.

If my $1000 in bitcoin is in one hub, I can spend any amount of it anywhere on the network, and save money by not opening extra channels.

If it's split all over the place, the network has to find channels from all the fragments if I want to spend all $1000.

These applications motivated new fields of applied mathematics.

Unfortunately, the LN developers and promoters do not seem to be aware of the challenges they face.

Ah come on, let's get real here. This is not true at all. How many people do you know that only have one connection to the network? Seriously? If you imagine hubs being wallet providers, exchanges, and business that accept btc payments - how many connections do you have at the minute? Establishing connections is how digital currencies work, they depend on connections - multiple ones, to create a network effect.

Again, not true. The majority of users will have multiple connections, without a shadow of a doubt.

Yes, this will be Tesco, Starbucks, Electrum, Ledger, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc etc, etc. There will be absolutely loads of these. Every business that accepts bitcoin will become one of these. The larger business will actually market the fact that there are a massive btc hub, and be proud of it.

"Indeed, a p2p payment network is more likely to have a ""small-world"" (SM) topology rather than the totally random (TR) topology that Jonald assumed.  

The difference boils down to an SM having a significant number of nodes with high degrees, whereas in a TR the node degrees are rather uniform. 

However, it seems that, for 10 million nodes, the average path length of SM (around 6) is about the same as that of a TR with average degree 11 as assumed by Jonald (around 7).  Moreover, the latter grows like the logarithm of the number of nodes, so it would be around 8 for 100 million, and around 9 for 1 billion.

Note also that social networks have a rather large degrees: on average, each person probably has dozens of contacts.  That is unlikely to be the case with the LN.  If you have 10 BTC evenly split among 10 payment channels, you cannot send a 3 BTC payment to anyone.  You would have to split it into 3 separate payments -- and many merchants would not accept that.  

Besides, if the fee for an on-chain payment is $2, and each channel lasts 2 years on average, then a user with 10 channels will pay $20 per year just to open and close them -- apart from the hub fees that will fall on each LN payment.

That, by the way, is another strong force that would drive the LN to wards a fully centralized topology, with one big hub and everyone having one channel to it, and hardly any other.";1;1;False;jstolfi;dji8fv1;Game Over Blockstream: Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution (by Jonald Fyookball);6jqrub;https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

Yes, essentially it is - but that is not to say that there is not this 'planning' in the big blocks roadmap either. Satoshi himself admitted that big blocks would mean mining centralisation into large data centres.

"> Am I wrong in stating that the LN does not prevent on-chain scaling and on-chain transactions? 

No, you are completely right. It is not LN, is are the people who use it as a reason to prevent onchain scaling. LN is more or less a victim of Bitcoin politics.

We had this discussion so often. Big Blockers dislike LN because at some point every discussion reaches the point where LN is made up to an argument against a blocksize increase. 

As a bonus, LN is completely uncontroversial. But as it is pushed as the only future of scaling Bitcoin it must be controversial.

"I think you need to see a bigger picture. For example, I'd be more than happy to deposit $5 a month into a LN that I found fully rewarding, trustworthy, and had some sort of small economy to participate in

For example, I have a Netflix account and I currently spend $9.99 per month or whatever it is to view streaming content. Point is, its a small amount compared to what I earn and I have to pay for it every month because it's a subscription.

Now, what if I instead deposited an initial deposit of $9.99 into Bitflix, a LN that, for the sake of argument, either rivals or outperforms Netflix's content. Difference now though is that Bitflix only charges me fractions of a penny for every second of video I watch. I can keep watching until I've watched the entire $9.99 worth of streaming content I paid for and to continue watching I simply deposit another $9.99.

With Netflix, if I don't use it for two weeks out of the month I still have to pay $9.99 next month to continue streaming. With Bitflix, after two weeks of vacation I'll come home and be able to still watch two weeks of content because I haven't used the remaining $4.995 in my channel.

"I have weekly withdrawals set up on Coinbase, altcoins held on Bittrex, but real funds are and will be in safety deposit boxes and safes -- anything large should be done with offline-created encrypted paper wallets on a live distro, and cold storage that may be used, held in encrypted airgapped wallets. Always have redundancy in your planning. IE more than one copy of wallets, just don't be careless. 

It's just convenient for me to have a draw on my income taken out automatically for weekly trading. Don't ever leave large amounts of money laying around for anyone to screw with after major exchanges have been owned, or caused problems for users through incompetence and not knowing laws. 

The only exchanges you should trust are like Gemini, but even they have major issues. If an exchange doesn't have AML and KYC information publicly viewable, and a transparency and registration with FINCEN then they aren't BSA compliant and your funds with them are subject to seizure at any given moment by the US government. The reason you should trust Gemini is that they're complying with some laws and thus can be forced through the courts to act. So if they fuck you over, you can sue them. They're the businesses that will last. The rest are going to get stepped on unless they step up their game.

I've just started my own coin and precious metals bullion business, and these are must-haves for any business dealing with any kind of stored value. Any transfer made over 10k within a 30 day period is subject to 1099 and FINCEN reporting. Any suspicious transfer over 2k must be reported as well. There are a shit-ton of compliancy requirements that apply to all of cryptocurrencies just like precious metals, collectibles and securities.

I was close to many people that are considered Icons of this, but they're all pawns in political games, too, many of them aren't idealists, they're working agendas for themselves, for pay or out of self-delusion. Human fallability and all that. Sure, but you should be motivated by that fear to push for a better world rather than live in denial of what's going on around us. We need to prevent the polarization that's gone on in politics in all of human history so that cryptography and cryptocurrencies continue to have a positive impact on the world. PayPal should die.

"If they're playing Payment Games then they likely haven't done enough research into what they're requirements are. They're statutorily required to give the cash back within a set time frame within many jurisdictions. Gemini has published KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) planning in place. And Gemini is also working state by state and jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Coinbase obviously hasn't been. They're just now (this year) playing catch-up with these laws, doing the bare minimum for years, whatever strikes them, and it sounds like they didn't bother to hire someone who used to work in the AML / KYC field at the IRS or somewhere similar, and instead chose to ""wing it"". They've said they're working in good faith to do better, but that's not enough when we're talking about holding on to 1/5th of a mil like that.

If they fuck around with peoples' money like this, the financial crimes enforcement network is going to be looking at them very closely and they're going to get audited for compliance.

This is why Amazon was having issues even without warehouse locations everywhere back in the day. They've basically been operating under the assumption that their local jurisdictions' laws are all that apply. Some states require you pay tax on stored value (gift cards, gold and silver bullion, etc) if you do any business in their state and register. 

For instance, Texas:

http://www.dob.texas.gov/money-services-businesses

OP needs to file a complaint with FINCEN and a complaint with his local state Department of Banking. They likely aren't licensed there, so they'll possibly get assraped in that state for playing games with other peoples' money in that state and not meeting local licensing requirements. If nothing else, this will get him his money quicker and spawn legislation that'll likely prevent this from happening in the future, plus investigations into CoinBase's actions for due diligence (which it doesn't look like they've cared to do whereas Gemini seems to be).

They'll also need state-by-state licenses for wire transfer, currency exchange licenses, meet net worth requirements, background check requirements, and a money services bond, and possibly a currency exchange license security and likely a trust company registration like Gemini has.

http://www.dob.texas.gov/banks-trust-companies/trust-companies

People have cited Article 12 of the UN Human Rights declaration as a protection against privacy and thus ignoring compliance requirements but the UN has no jurisdiction overwriting state and federal law.

There are many components of MSB's registration requirements, on an International, US Federal, State and Local level, and AML prevention requirements. And they, and many other exchanges are about to learn the hard way. 2015 was a hell of a year for the Patriot Act and Banking Secrecy Act, and most MSBs in my field (bullion and coins) still don't even realize they're MSBs.
