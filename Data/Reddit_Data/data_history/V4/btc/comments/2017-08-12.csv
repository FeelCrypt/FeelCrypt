"> But I definitely read your previous comment as an argument for keeping malleability to prevent off-chain scaling, and my response reflected that.

It was originaly presented at a time when proponents fo limiting transaction capacity to 1MB were proposing it as a fix to scaling bitcoin. 

>Second, I don't think malleability is primarily an issue for zero-conf. I see it more as a risk for poorly designed payment systems looking for whether their transaction has confirmed by ID. This is something that should work. It's an obvious significant cost to complexity that it doesn't and an obvious SFYL potential.

I've seen ways around this problem, with somthing similar to a Child Pays for Parent scenario. No point arguing the fact now, we're not getting a fix for bitcoin transactions, and we are getting a fix for segwit transactions. but we are getting a 2MB hard fork and so long as we keep the limit above demand i see no need for concern.

It is in dispute, nothing about SegWit keeps a node from signature data. If a node wants it, all it has to do is get it. Not everyone will prune signature data just like not all validating nodes prune old blocks today. Signature data is important and will be kept by any who wish to use a fully validating and storing node to help promote a healthy network.

Actually, SegWit allows light nodes to completely verify that a transaction is in a block without having to download and verify witness data.

"Yes, that's the gist of the ""it's less safe"" argument. In BTC and BCH now, all nodes have the full transaction which promotes decentralisation. Lightweight nodes just prune ""historical"" transactions (so they only keep recent transactions). This is also a risk to some extent, but because the most recent transactions have the fewest confirmations they're also the easiest to attack: removing old transactions isn't too much of a problem

The argument against SegWit is that by removing the signature, lightweight nodes can't verify transactions, and the network relies on a smaller number of full nodes

Whether you think this is a risk is for you to decide, although obviously the further we go into this stuff the harder it is for me to stay purely factual - so in the interests of declaring my own biases, my opinion is that this seems a rather unlikely attack vector, but that it's an attack vector nonetheless and I'm not sure it's the right solution, although I don't see it as ""the enemy of Bitcoin"" or anything like that";2;1;False;audigex;dlijwkf;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

>What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Alters incentive structure of bitcoin, changes the way signatures are stored, completely disrespects the white paper, which is what we invested in.

Wish I could help here but you are probably going to have to do what all of us did, just study until you figure it out.

>What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

TM and QH are two minor imperfections in the Bitcoin Network. Solving these issues right now is by no means crucial for the functioning of bitcoin, but L2 won't work without, so that's why they make such a big deal out of it. They need it to push the L2 onto us.

>Who are these people everyone speaks of?

Jihan Wu is the owner of the biggest mining equipment manufacturer, a big blocker, he gets slandered all the time but there is nothing really bad about him.

> What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition

A second layer solution is a network built on TOP of bitcoin. You can transact back and forth on a ledger, but the final balances don't get settled until you perform an on chain transaction. Think of it like a paypal account, based on bitcoin, backed by bitcoin (so they say.)

>What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine?

Transaction fees.

>How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?

Not fucked at all, yes we can make minor changes to prevent this, but it probably won't be necessary for a long time. Bitcoin is extremely cryptographically secure. It is something like a million times the combined computing power of the whole world to crack a BIP38 encryption.

>Why did Satoshi disappear?

Either he's already dead, or he disappeared for his own safety. Think about what he did.

Most mining equipment is made there, they have a lot of cheap hydroelectricity, the government gives subsidies to bitcoin miners (not 100% sure about this though) and think about the chinese culture, bitcoin is good for them.

"> I am not trying to prevent anything, just pointing out we don't need to change  the bitcoin incentive design and consensus rules to make it possible. 

I agree malleability is not the biggest issue ever. But I definitely read your previous comment as an argument for keeping malleability to prevent off-chain scaling, and my response reflected that.

> if its not confirmed in a block it has not happened, don't send unconfirmed funds, that's how bitcoin works. gravity can be irritating, people learn to use it effectively. 

First, while zero conf is inherently insecure, I don't agree with acting like it's horrible or against Bitcoin's design. Satoshi gave examples of how it could work. Many payment processors implement it. It's a great way to be able to get nearly-instant payments. A confirmation is a settlement; the transaction is the payment. A double-spend can be fraud depending on the circumstances.

Second, I don't think malleability is primarily an issue for zero-conf. I see it more as a risk for poorly designed payment systems looking for whether their transaction has confirmed by ID. This is something that *should* work. It's an obvious significant cost to complexity that it doesn't and an obvious SFYL potential. Sure, everyone should know about it and know how to code around Bitcoin's bug but that doesn't make it right.

> I'm not opposed to off chain solutions there are lots, I'm opposed to changing the consensus rules precisely to accommodate a pacific proposed solution, if the 1MB is a bug that has been useful to achieve that goal then malleability is useful too - remove the limit and lets remove malleability, keep the limit then keep malleability you can keep the limit and remove malleability. that's destroying the network incentive to settle all fee paying transactions on chain.

There are some clarity issues here but I'll point out that 1MB is not a bug. It was a deliberate design choice. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. I think you're kind of abusing the term ""bug"".

To be clear: I think increasing capacity is a good idea. But by no stretch of the imagination should 1MB hard cap be called a bug.

> 
to clarify all users pay for bitcoin security, some off chain users use bitcoin security withoout paying the fees needed to secure it, when there is no more reward, who pays for fees? the of-chain solutions who don-t have too? I honestly dont have a problem removing transaction malleability, I have a problem removing it and keeping a transaction limit. The limit literally will force people into using layer 2 transaction networks. 

Off-chain transactions pay fees when they settle. I think there's always going to be enough demand for on-chain to keep some fees around. I've just never been as concerned about the obsession with always having massive hashing and being terrified of running out of fees in the future or anything. I really don't think it's the biggest issue.

I do agree that the 1MB limit is long overdue to be replaced. Frankly, I don't even believe that it will push people into layer 2 as much as into other coins: personally, the limit was a major factor in me starting to look at alts.

"Points for creativity.

First, it wasn't designed to do that. So at best, it's an ""unintentional feature"". Which is just a bug you happen to like.

Second, while I don't like Lightning, in large part because of the way it's been oversold into vaporware status, and I much prefer on-chain scaling to off-chain ""solutions"", I don't think trying to prevent anything from happening offchain is useful.

Third, it *is* irritating. Not insurmountable, but it *can* lead to losses if a person doesn't realize that a transaction can be confirmed with a different ID than it was sent out with. That's just not a good design.

The scapegoat argument you make sounds a lot like hyperbole. It may be some people have made that case, but I've never seen anything anywhere near as extreme as that (although I've made a point of avoiding /r/bitcoin for a while now).

Finally, I'm not convinced that malleability would be enough to prevent any and all off-chain solutions. For instance, a tipbot is technically off-chain scaling, and that works just fine. Comparatively, at least Lightning and similar solutions are using actual Bitcoin transactions which could be settled on-chain in theory. So you would prefer to prevent off-chain scaling in what is essentially a smart contract type of design in favor of only allowing centralized off-chain scaling?

To try to clarify that last point further: there are going to be people doing business off-chain. Why would you deliberately want to prevent Bitcoin transactions from being able to be used just because you don't like the way they're being used? Off-chain scaling is not necessarily opposed to on-chain scaling. Lightning could never work with a 1MB block size.

"With SegWit, lightweight nodes (by far the most common) cannot fully verify their own data because they do not have signatures for the transactions. I don't think that's in dispute?

I'm not saying that's bad for individuals, who can indeed run a full node if they need one - I'm saying it's bad for the overall system, since there are far fewer blocks providing the network authority, which makes attacks potentially easier and reduces decentralisation

I don't understand your point. What part of SegWit makes it so a node cannot verify transactions? All it does is make an even lighter node that still does some verification possible. It does not remove any types of already existing nodes. If you want to verify all transactions and or the block history to promote decentralization, just run a node that does it. SegWit takes none of that away.;1;1;False;Linrono;dlipx5q;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

"> I don't think trying to prevent anything from happening offchain is useful

I am not trying to prevent anything, just pointing out we don't need to change  the bitcoin incentive design and consensus rules to make it possible. 

>First, it wasn't designed to do that. So at best, it's an ""unintentional feature""

sure lets define the costs and benefits before labeling it a bug. 

>Third, it is irritating. Not insurmountable, but it can lead to losses if a person doesn't realize that a transaction can be confirmed with a different ID than it was sent out with. That's just not a good design.

if its not confirmed in a block it has not happened, don't send unconfirmed funds, that's how bitcoin works. gravity can be irritating, people learn to use it effectively. 

>I'm not convinced that malleability would be enough to prevent any and all off-chain solutions.

I'm not opposed to off chain solutions there are lots, I'm opposed to changing the consensus rules precisely to accommodate a pacific proposed solution, if the 1MB is a bug that has been useful to achieve that goal then malleability is useful too - remove the limit and lets remove malleability, keep the limit then keep malleability you can keep the limit and remove malleability. that's destroying the network incentive to settle all fee paying transactions on chain. 

to clarify all users pay for bitcoin security, some off chain users use bitcoin security withoout paying the fees needed to secure it, when there is no more reward, who pays for fees? the of-chain solutions who don-t have too? I honestly dont have a problem removing transaction malleability, I have a problem removing it and keeping a transaction limit. The limit literally will force people into using layer 2 transaction networks.

"> Blocks are the data being hashed by miners

By that definition, the signatures are *always* in the block.  Blocks are also things stored by non-mining nodes, in which case the signature data is optional.

> the signature data are not part of this hash

That is incorrect.  You understand the concept of the Merkle tree, right?  The hash of hashes of hashes validates everything in the tree?

The combined hashes of all the signature data are included in the coinbase of a transaction, which means that the block header that's hashed in mining indirectly includes hashes of the transaction data *and the signatures*, and therefore neither can be changed later without invalidating the block.

Signatures are not hashed *every time* by miners (i.e. billions of times a second), they're hashed once per block, exactly like the transaction data itself.

">What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

It was designed to fix transaction malleability (but only for SegWit transactions, not legacy) with the intention of never needing to hard fork. Because of this, its very sloppy and leaves a lot to be desired. But guess what, we have hard forks already. If it was a hard fork upgrade it would be much better and a lot of people wouldnt have issues with it. Many see it as Core's way to retain control of the development and build their side chains like Liquid where all the fees go to them, not miners.

>What are transaction malleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

This is when you alter an existing transactions signature. There are multiple solutions to this and SegWit is one. Child-pays-for-parent transactions is also a current way to avoid this. Some also believe transaction malleability is a feature to prevent tons of side chains from splitting up bitcoin into hubs using intermediaries. The fact is you can use bitcoin now without worry and there are ways to prevent and detect malleated transactions. This is a politicized point to support SegWit.

>Who are these people everyone speaks of? I feel like I need a master roster. How can a new person care what Jihan Wu says if they have no idea who he is or why what he says is important?

Eh? He is a miner who supports bit blocks. He is the CEO of the largest mining hardware manufacturing company for bitcoin. Hard to answer this one without specific questions.

>What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition? Or does it fall in a different category?

A patented payments hub that has the potential to be monitored and controlled. Combined with a 1mb cap, you no longer have peer-to-peer transactions in bitcoin since there is no room left on-chain once real adoption occurs.You can build lots of neat features on second layer, but there are also many ways to execute this.

>What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine? It seems like the ever-reducing reward for solving a block would have to be met with an ever-increasing price of coin or miners will start losing money. And eventually we hit a cap, right? Or is it that we'll always be approaching the cap, but halving the distance we move toward it so we never in effect reach 21 million total coins?

Keeping transactions on chain is critical since hash power secures the network. Once the block reward is gone, the value of bitcoin (assuming success) will be very high and transaction fees will suffice to make revenue. Miners set their minimum transaction fees. This was Satoshis intention. If you take all transactions off chain, miners wont make profit and will move to a competing currency. large blocks allow of many transactions. 

>How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?

These technological developments dont happen overnight. We will have time to prepare. If there was some quantum computer that could break all encryption tomorrow you would have to worry about a LOT more than just your bitcoin private keys.

>Why did Satoshi disappear? 

The CIA was looking for him because they were onto silk road. Also, creating a currency that can technically remove power (currency control) from governments is not something you want to personally take claim for. Bitcoin doesnt have a leader. Its supposed to be market driven. 

>Why is China so involved in cryptocurrency? Is it just the rich upper class, or are the poor taking advantage of free/subsidized electricity to generate wealth? If it's the latter, why aren't draconian Chinese authorities cracking down?

China has a lot of excess energy that is not used. Its only logical that mining would grow quicker in China. You have Russia now stating they plan to give China competition to balance the mining distribution because they want a new global currency that isnt controlled by the US. Mining is more decentralized than it has ever been. Miner centralization isnt really an issue because the self interest of all involved is a larger valuation for bitcoin. Openly attacking the network would lower its value even for miners. If the Chinese government were to crack down on mining and take control, you could eaisly have a fork and people would rally to support the new chain. Many scenarios are possible. Bitcoin is all about censorship resistance. Look at the resistance to the 1mb cap for example, which was never the intended design for bitcoin going forward.";2;0;False;cdn_int_citizen;dli4ah8;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

> What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad"".

The main problem with SegWit, as I see it, is that it allows removing the signature data from the blockchain - and even allows miners to delete this data. This might sound cool until you remember that Satoshi _defined_ a Bitcoin as a ""chain of digital signatures"" - so getting rid of the signatures would probably seriously damage Bitcoin's security model.

"You've gotten few serious answers.

> What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Most transactions require digital signatures from the owner to be valid. SegWit moves these signatures to a different part of the data structure that makes up a block. Instead of being nested with transactions signatures are off in their own area.

> What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

The ID of the transaction is in part based on the signature. There can be multiple valid signatures for a given piece of data, and different signatures would give different IDs for an otherwise similar transaction. Because most transactions refer to previous transaction;s ID that makes things difficult. Further, the signature can be changed by anybody in a way that does not affect its validity but changes its data and therefore the transaction id.

Quadratic hashing means that validating transactions is inefficient and as you add signatures to a transaction you increase the time it takes to validate disproportionately. If an attacker can make it take a long time to validate all their transactions the number of people that can validate them does down. The number of people actually validating that everything is correct decreases.

> What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition? Or does it fall in a different category?

Most protocols are designed in layers. See the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) for example. It's a protocol that uses the underlying Bitcoin protocol but requires no changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself. Bip141 (segwit) is not a second layer solution, it's a change the the first layer. But that change makes it easier to build other layers.

TCP is one layer of networking but it's harder to use than most developers want to deal with. HTTP was invented as a layer on top of TCP to transport documents and it's a lot easier for people to work with. It uses TCP underneath but handles a lot of other stuff as well.

> What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine? It seems like the ever-reducing reward for solving a block would have to be met with an ever-increasing price of coin or miners will start losing money. And eventually we hit a cap, right? Or is it that we'll always be approaching the cap, but halving the distance we move toward it so we never in effect reach 21 million total coins?

Transaction fees. Either the amount of transactions needs to go up a ton or the price per transaction does. Or somewhere in the middle.

> How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?

Bitcoin is quantum safe. Quantum computers don't help with mining at all. The worst they could do is reverse public keys to private keys but they can not reverse hashes to public keys. So as long as you don't reuse addresses there is no issues. If you do, you already have issues and should stop doing that.

"> What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Essentially it takes the ""signature"" out of the main part of the block, shrinking it.

Pre-fork, there was a 1mb block, which could hold roughly a couple of thousand transactions every 10 minutes.

Each transaction is, at the most basic level, a ""from"" address (public key), a ""to"" address (public key), an amount, and the biggest part, the signature. Essentially, the signature is the proof that the person who is sending the transaction, owns the private key that relates to the ""from"" address. Explaining the signature in detail is probably out of scope here, but the basic concept is that it's the ""encrypted"" transaction, encrypted with the private key. Because of the way the keys work, anyone with the public key (like us, because we can see the transaction) can decrypt the signature with the public key, proving it was encrypted with the private key. If you don't already understand this, let me know and I'll try to explain it in a bit more detail.

Unfortunately these signatures are big - about 2/3 of the total block. SegWit, at it's most basic, takes these signatures out of the main ""block"" and attaches them to a ""witness"" section. The idea is that not everyone needs to be able to verify every transaction: so if you just want to trust that the network has verified it and use the raw transaction data, you can run a lightweight node without them. This has a result that for lightweight nodes, a SegWit 1MB block has the capacity equivalent to a 3-4MB block.

I won't get into why that's a good or bad thing here, since you didn't ask. There are various reasons to consider it both, though. See Transaction Malleability below though, which does relate to it

> Can we get an acronym master list with short definitions for things?

Probably a bit long for this reply, but good idea

> What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

These are brought up together because they're closely related. Remember that signature we make above? Well it turns out that it's actually possible sometimes for one transaction to potentially have two valid signatures: that's okay when authorizing transactions, because you can only make either with the private key (so it's not a security flaw in terms of me stealing your money)

The problem comes because it means I, as the sender of the transaction, could change my signature later to another, completely valid signature, but one that is different to the first. It would still authorize the transaction, but it's different to the original.

So why does that matter? Well, in Bitcoin, the Transaction ID (literally, the code that identifies the transaction) is not numbered like 1, 2, 3... instead it's created from a hash of the transaction details. *Including* the signature. See why this is a problem yet? If I change my signature, the transaction changes. That is transaction malleability: the transaction is ""malleable"" - it can be changed.

Within the basic bitcoin chain this is fine, because the transactions are still valid with the new signature: but if you try to build a service on top of bitcoin that, for example, you will likely use the TX ID to identify the transaction (I mean, that's the entire idea of it). If someone can change the TX ID later, that makes it much harder to build applications on top of Bitcoin: especially second-layer payment applications. Again, I won't discuss here whether this is a good or bad thing

> What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine? It seems like the ever-reducing reward for solving a block would have to be met with an ever-increasing price of coin or miners will start losing money. And eventually we hit a cap, right? Or is it that we'll always be approaching the cap, but halving the distance we move toward it so we never in effect reach 21 million total coins?

Short answer, transaction fees.

Alternate short answer: we could move to a Proof of Stake system. This is a bit in-depth to discuss here, but TL;DR it means instead of mining, you ""mine"" with a wallet. Instead of the work costing electricity (the current method of discouraging cheats, because it costs you money to cheat), if you try to cheat then the coins in your wallet are confiscated/destroyed. It's an interesting concept for the future.

> What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition? Or does it fall in a different category?

BIP141 doesn't create a second layer solution, but by removing transaction malleability it makes them easier for the reasons mentioned.

A second layer solution/application is, essentially, a way of processing transactions OFF chain into fewer big transaction, and then only putting that final transaction on the blockchain. The idea is essentially to reduce the number of transactions on the blockchain.

The problem for many people is that they see second layer as being corporate/controlled systems for companies to profit from, rather than part of a decentralized blockchain. The simplest fact for me is that they are probably inevitable - the real question is whether they're handled in the *spirit* of Bitcoin, or whether they just become ""VISA on the Bitcoin Blockchain"" and ""PayPal Sidechains"" etc, with the same old companies profiting off us

> How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?

Rather, and absolutely. The first quantum computers will only be able to do a few things. Frankly, I'm not convinced they'll appear in my lifetime.

No idea, nor does anyone else. Most likely he was either too busy to continue in a lead role, or my preferred option, let go of the pseudonym and continued working on Bitcoin as ""himself"" as just another guy who came along later.

It's both, although in Bitcoin mostly the wealthy because of the huge costs of BTC mining. Many of the Chinese middle classes (and there are a LOT more of them than you probably think) are involved with ETH and other altcoin mining, though.

"> What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine? It seems like the ever-reducing reward for solving a block would have to be met with an ever-increasing price of coin or miners will start losing money. 

What a great question. The only answer I've ever gotten was hand-waving and double-talk. I'd love to hear the answer. Satoshi opined that transaction fees alone would sustain them, but that brings up more questions than it settles.

How about this: if Bitcoin's price doubles forever, we won't have any problems until 2140, and by then we'll all be dead.

Weekly tech jargon summary stickied on the reddit, possibly pros/cons discussion of said technology, interesting posts and links attached to said sticky, maybe examples of it being implemented by other coins and why they chose it/ did it achieve their goal? etc

Could be used to described things like:

segwit
colored coins
lightning network implementations
Algos like PoS,dPoS , Sha256 and the reasons they were chosen, further info can be linked to in wiki articles.

we could talk about upcoming and current issues that will impact the userbase aswell as the development of bitcoin.

You appear to not have a strong understanding of the reality of facts. I recommend reading without talking while you learn

Any research would quickly show you that while Satoshi left Gavin in control of Bitcoin, he did this some 6 months after Gavin told ev everyone he was meeting with the CIA. He stopped publically posting shortly after he said wiki8leaks had kicked the hornets nest.

"**OSI model**

The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model defined seven layers.

"Thanks a lot, this is great!

I have several follow-up questions though:

>  if you just want to trust that the network has verified it and use the raw transaction data, you can run a lightweight node without them.

Is this why some people say that SegWit poses a security risk?

And since centralisation is the big enemy, in the end, could you expand on what ways one could hurt Bitcoin if the network came to have a significant portion of lightweight nodes?

Overall, I understand that there is no ideal scaling solution proposal for now, is that right?

"One suggestion to improve this answer: it's somewhat misleading to explain digital signatures in terms of encryption/decryption, even if those terms make for a simpler explanation. There is actually no encryption in Bitcoin. It uses only cryptographic hashes and cryptographic signatures, but no encryption. Client-side wallet encryption does exist in some wallet apps, but that's not part of the Bitcoin network protocol or block format.

The reason it's worth it to avoid mischaracterizing Bitcoin as using encryption is that hiding information is the opposite of what Bitcoin is about. In Bitcoin, all information is open. Everyone has the same copy of the same ledger, and every single bit in the blockchain serves the same purpose for everyone -- either to move funds, to prove that the owner of those funds authorized the move, or to show that a block is valid and complete. Contrast ciphertext, which is worthless noise to anyone who doesn't possess the key to decrypt it. If Bitcoin contained encrypted data, I might have less incentive to store that data in my node. That's not the case, and the result is that everyone running a node has the same interest in preserving the entire blockchain.

There's a political angle, too. Some politicians want to ban encryption or require backdoors in it. That's a bad idea, of course, but even if it happened, it wouldn't affect Bitcoin. (I have never seen a proposal to ban digital signatures. That absolutely would affect Bitcoin. It would be surprising if a politician took such a position.)";2;0;False;sowbug;dlidkyv;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

"yes which is a purely a political argument...

do you realize if you prefix bitcoin address with c most people wont even realize?

**bitcoin already has multiple address formats, one of them hides your public key from quantum attacks.**

**Adding a simple prefix, will not be noticed by users at all, its something for wallet makers.**

Your point is shared by many people unfortunately, and no, it does not move us away from the bitcoin brand name.
