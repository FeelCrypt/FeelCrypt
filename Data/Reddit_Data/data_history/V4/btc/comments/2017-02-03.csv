"Thanks, I'm not negotiating on anyone's behalf, there is no need to negotiate anything.  

I'm interested in the analysts of the projected PR message of various stake holders and how that impacts the trading price in dark pools and on exchanges.  

I would love to comment on your r/bitocin post but unfortunately I've been forbidden. 

let me know when the #BtcNegotiate group acknowledges that the 1MB soft fork limit is not part of the core protocol.

my position on the matter is expressed here: https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-888#post-34084  

I invite you to join in an uncensored discussion on the forum linked above.

"Hi u/Riiume 

I take offence at your framing of **core protocol** in the referenced comment below it shows bias and a lack of understanding.

The 1MB limit is not part of the bitcoin protocol, it is a soft fork limit introduced in 2010 - what a ridiculous stance calling it the ""core"" protocol.

> The point is, we need to find a deal that appeals to everyone and preserves the integrity of the **core** protocol.

You should try backing the bitcoin protocol not some proprietary 1MB ""core"" protocol. 

Who exactly **needs to find a deal** in a decentralized system? It would reflect more honestly if you were more direct and call it the BS/Core protocol.

For instance, just recently when BU clients mined an invalid block, he claimed that this was an ""orphaned"" block, which it technically is, and made it look like the only damage was only the 12.5BTC reward lost, trying to shift focus away from the fact that the BU developers have poor quality assurance.

"Yes, coreboys are common trolls, you can recognize them easily by:

they will deny the Bitcoin whitepaper is important

they will use a word, and when called out for being wrong use an archaic definition of the word to try and justify themselves as not being a liar

they will allude to problems and things but never spell them out and name call those who ask them for proof

They will post mistruths as facts even after being proven wrong 

they don't have evidence or data to support their opinions.
