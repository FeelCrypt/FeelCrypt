"And similar to Liquid, the Federal Reserve Act may well be the shadiest piece of legislation ever signed by a sitting President, drafted by a minority cartel of bankers and industrialists in secret to seize control of America financially. 

Even President Woodrow Wilson later lamented he basically just sold America to bankers wholesale, not unlike Blockstream seizing control of a radically new banking system through racketeering, extortion, and censorship. I remember well how they lied initially with grand promises only to show their true colors as Keynesian centralist scumbags-

"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"". The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974. The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

"Yes, though I think that came down to a simple ignorance leading to over-reliance on Core devs, largely due to the language barrier and a level of technical incompetence in terms of not having a deeper understanding of the protocol, plugging in hardware and turning it on really doesn't require much thought. Its only been fairly recent that miners seem to now understand their role in the network better.

Thanks to massive price manipulation with bogus instruments like Tether, miners have no incentive to not mine BTC as long as it is profitable to do so. But as we are witnessing, Blockstream is trying to cut miners out of the picture, so we'll see how long that lasts.

"It is, but at the same time the original Bitcoin protocol proved that *we can and have* done better than centralized fiat, and it could indeed be done with an entirely new breed of currency backed by cryptographic supercomputing that was also turned the old corporate governance model inside out. This has the power to democratize finance the same way the Internet put an end to centralized publishing and opened the floodgates on doing business at a global scale.

This, however, is why the financial incumbents hate Bitcoin and have worked tirelessly for years to put a stop to it, unsuccessfully I might add. While they screwed up BTC they just opened Pandora's box wider, since there are now 1000s of networks.

"> What were they going to do?

First, they were going to undermine my code directly by making it malfunction at critical times. I prevented this directly first by excising someone from access to my code, then ultimately removing the source from public access entirely.

Then, they undermined my work indirectly, as well as many others, by rendering its purpose useless; in my case, there was no demand for 0-conf risk assessment in an environment that even an algorithm cannot reasonably predict (namely, multiple high-congestion events).

In that, they were successful. 0-conf risk assessment algorithms have been worthless for BTC ever since. There is no purpose in reviving that dead project. Happily, more advanced algorithms designed for BCH are already in use now, so that avenue is moot as well.
