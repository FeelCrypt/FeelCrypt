"> Sorry but you’ve fallen for propaganda.

I studied Bitcoin myself enough to understand value of running full node. Hell, I understood it back in 2012 when I started to use Bitcoin. (I'm not filthy rich because I was just playing with small amounts.) There was no reason for propaganda to exist at that time! 

> The idea that you need to run a so-called “full node” to protect yourself from a misbehaving mining majority is nonsense.

In the world without states and similarly powerful entities, you'd be right. Bitcoin was specifically designed to withstand attacks of powerful entities. I'm not protecting against neutral miners, I'm protecting against the government.

Your analogy has few problems: first, running full node isn't too expensive. Second, you think that miners are somewhat more powerful than full nodes. This is not physical world, where power makes sense. This is math. Something false won't become true just because someone powerful says so. Miners could have 100% mining power, yet their block would be considered invalid by my node, if they disobeyed the rules. Thirdly that guy isn't my enemy now, but my enemy will likely bribe him or coerce him into attacking me.

> The idea that we should keep block sizes artificially small to make it cheaper for people to validate everyone else's transactions -- at the cost of making it too expensive for them to even MAKE their own -- is insane.

I guess your priority is Bitcoin being system for small payments. In that case, I suggest you to use PayPal. AFAIK it does this job better right now. (I hope Bitcoin will catch up with LN.) If you want Bitcoin to be resistant to government attacks, you have to make it possible to work even in extreme conditions (censorship, slow Internet ...)

> The average user has absolute ZERO need to run a so-called ""full node.""

Only if you assume average user should be poor. If you have small amount, sure, SPV is enough. But once user wants to buy significant portion of bitcoins, he probably wants to verify they are genuine.

> An SPV client can allow you to verify that the transactions that you care about have been included in a block with valid PoW and grow increasingly confident that this block has been accepted by the network as a whole as you watch it get buried ever deeper under more blocks with valid PoW while remaining the longest chain.

This works well in these cases:

* There are no government attacks.
* There are no hard forks.
* If there is a hard fork, you specifically want to use the one with higher hash rate and you somehow know that the hash rate won't change.

Sadly, there is upcoming hardfork and people need to use full nodes to protect themselves because we don't know for sure which fork will have higher hash rate.

> that difference is extremely tiny, if not essentially theoretical,

It's practically the same as with digital signatures. There is almost zero probability that you'll ever see invalid one, but the moment you remove verification code and someone finds out, you'll be attacked.

> Bitcoin's security model has always been explicitly premised on the assumption that the mining majority would be incentivized to be ""honest""

The thing incentivising them to be honest are people verifying that they are. The only way to verify them is via full nodes.

> Moreover, a malicious hash rate majority doesn't need to produce ""invalid"" blocks to defraud users or otherwise completely undermine the network's integrity.

If there is a malicious majority, it'd be much more economical for them to make fake coins if nobody else verified.

Depending on how that double spend looks like. If it's miners rewriting history, then you're right. If there's transaction in block that doesn't belong there, they ignore that block. They are no powerless.

"The main concern when onboarding a new node is obtaining trust, that is to say, not being spoofed into coming on-line with false data.  This is prevented if the potential new node gets one single hash value correctly, the hash of the most recent block.  Thus it is very hard to spoof a new node.

As to denial of service attacks, that's another matter entirely.  However, this is not the normal scenario when on boarding a new node.

"Bitcoin is supposed to be efficient and robust.  This seems contradictory, and actually is contradictory if people run idiotic single threaded software, which introduces artificial tradeoffs between performance and robustness, thereby creating attack vectors and encouraging denial of service attacks.

The solution to this problem is to take an optimistic solution that remains tolerably efficient in the case of an attack, and changing gears as needed to a more conservative approach when necessary.
Thus, if the attack vector is a huge block which is extremely inefficient to verify, the approach would indicate parallel validation, so that the huge block gets orphaned, rather than grinding the network to a halt.  (This approach was implemented in Bitcoin Unlimited.)

You can verify that each input corresponds to a prior output that has not been double spent.  It does not matter where you get the block data.

"NOTHING will help you against misconfiguration, bugs and fork events: even if you run a full node there's no guarantee that YOUR node will not be the one misconfigured, affected by the bug or not following the fork.

Moreover, you CAN easily detect these events with both SPV and full: the block time will sharply increase after factoring in DA.

Also, in your extreme situation, the remaining 49% of miners will consider the block invalid, will warn the users about it, will continue mining the valid chain and will isolate colluding miners. The only result will be that colluding miners have lost money.
