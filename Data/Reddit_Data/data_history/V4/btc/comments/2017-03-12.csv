">There is some ambiguity in what a hard fork means

Let's get this straight. ""Fork"" in either soft or hard variations doesn't depend on what happens to the blockchain. It's a software development term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)

A ""soft"" fork is a fork where both resulting versions of the software can continue to use the same database (the blockchain). A ""hard"" fork results in two versions of the software that disagree on the proper structure of the database, causing the users of each branch to use a different version of the database.

BU is a fork of core. It's considered a hard fork because blocks considered valid by BU will sometimes be rejected by core, meaning that the chain will split if there is contention among the miners. At a 75%+ activation a chain split is unlikely, but that doesn't make any difference: BU is still a fork of core. It's still changed the rules of the database they both work with in a way that the original implementation will reject. This it's always a hard fork and will always be a hard fork.

The only issue with this language (which has been in the Bitcoin space since the beginning) is that the developers of core have been trying to demonize the act of making a fork of their software that isn't 1-for-1 compatible with their implementation. Don't let them control the language; there's nothing inherently dangerous about forking the software (Monero successfully hard forks several times a year with no problems, Bitcoin has previously had firmed with no problems).";6;1;False;Dasque;deu5fx9;Gavin Andresen on Twitter - Running BU is saying 'I'm ready for bigger blocks whenever there is wide consensus for bigger blocks' | Not 'let's fork ASAP';5yz7dk;https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/840940621456125952

No matter how fast your machine is, there's some size, probably around 3MB, where a specially-constructed block will take you more than 10 minutes to verify, and a 4MB block may take several hours.

"There is some ambiguity in what a hard fork means. Consider that if everyone runs BU with EB>1MB, a bigger block would not trigger a hard fork. 

So the riddle is, when did the hard fork happen? Either (a) it didn't ever happen and we don't need a hard fork to get to bigger blocks, or (b) some miners would already be hardforking as soon as they move to BU with EB>1MB, even though no blocks bigger than 1MB had yet been published. 

I would say (a) is the correct idea. Miners first increase the size of blocks they are willing to accept, then they start publishing the bigger blocks. Rather than speak of ""hard forks,"" it would be clearer to say there is a possibility of a *split* if some miners publish bigger blocks while only part of the network has started accepting bigger blocks. (So obviously miners won't publish bigger blocks until hashpower accepting bigger blocks is at least a supermajority, giving some advance warning for any minority hashpower to get with the program.) The hard fork terminology just confuses things here, as it can refer to something that results in a split or not.
