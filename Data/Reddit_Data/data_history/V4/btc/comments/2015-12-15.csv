"Recent comment by him with regards to Gavin Andresen...

>Of course he does.
He will lose, just like he lost BIP101 and XT. Eventually he will lose his MIT job once they realise he is not actually doing research but instead playing lobbyist.

"I do believe downvotes are aggressively abused here (and on /r/bitcoin).

I think it's unfair to give downvotes simply because one is disagreeing with the point of view in a comment, and even more unfair to systematically downvote every comment from persons one is disagreeing with.

/r/btc has drawn in a lot of people that are in favor of BIP101 and ""bigger block limit, the sooner the better"" - and I tend to find myself in that camp - but still, remember that the ultimate goal for /r/btc is to become the new /r/bitcoin.  It doesn't really work out when the most upvoted posts all the time are either bashing Blockstream or promoting bigger blocks, we need better content than that.

And still, aggressive moderation does not work out, because the raison d'Ãªtre with this group was to avoid the aggressive moderation seen at /r/bitcoin.

Here is some suggestions:

* Create some new sub, i.e. /r/btc_meta for discussing moderation of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, plus anything else related to the usage of reddit in the cryptocurrency scene.  Declare that all meta discussions are unwanted here.
* Declare that posts that does nothing but promote big block limits or bash the core developers should go to /r/bitcoin_uncensored

I requested of the r/btc moderators to un-ban me. This is the post I sent to them:

    I request you to re-evaluate the validity of this ban.

    I don't believe saying ""go away"" constitutes an infraction on any guidelines.
    It's not spamming and it's not trolling.

    It is my belief that the ban originated out of an emotional response to my post,
    and perhaps the fact that I voiced publicly my opinion that btcdrak should not be a moderator.

    r/btc is supposed to be what r/bitcoin failed to be. If we are not free to speak out

And it's not a ""conspiracy theory"", the ATF agent openly said they were pissed about what Roger said in his speech in front of the DA.

Edit: man, of COURSE he's not remorseful. He really did nothing wrong, was targeted for speech.

"I don't know the whole story, but the side I've seen makes me pretty sure I agree that he seems unfit. 

As a btc user with no expertise I wonder why the moderators aren't less involved in Bitcoin itself. Shouldn't moderation be based on discussion and not content? I suppose there's a grey area of on topic or not that would take a decent level of knowledge, but that seems to be what the voting system is for.

"Agreed. I'd also encourage people to mail /u/MemoryDealers and *politely* voice your opposition to btcdrak being a mod.

A mod should be non-confontational, polite to users, respectful (and be respected by the users in turn), tolerant (especially of differing viewpoints), non-obstructive (especially when users voice their displeasure on a subject, banning because you don't like what some say is childish and petty, but Bbtcdrak shows he's eager to do just that), and open minded (should readily consider the wants and needs of users, of which is clear in his opening post that he has no interest in fostering the community that currently resides, but instead wants to rebuild the community from scratch in his own image). Btcdrak is none of these things, and his ""welcome post"" clearly demonstrates right off the bat that he is not fit to stand in that kind of position nor is he respected among members of this sub's community. His posts in /r/bitcoin has clearly shown he is an abrasive personality.
