"As long as you think we should stay at 1MB as long as not ""ALL of us"" agree with 2 MB, don't be surprised to have people with a sense of democracy against you. Because you attitude implies a veto right even for the smallest group of small blockers. This is outright crazy. Don't expect to be even taken seriously.

If you feel misunderstood, sorry, then you have to be clearer in what you are writing. I can only judge you from what you are writing:

">funny how you write about manipulating nodes, when that is exactly the thing what xt and classic did

You said it yourself. it was manipulated. So your 85% number is meaningless, the nide count is meaningless, this is exactly what I said. Very funny indeed that you find this funny. You seem to have a quite twisted way of thinking.

>When you say  i have no clue, you mean generaly or in the blocksize debate or just you don't have any argument left?

I can only judge what I read in this thread. Don't know how you could think otherwise. Why should I generalize. This is not my pattern of thinking and judging. Maybe it's yours - why else should you get this weird idea?

">By not all of us, i meant ~95% hashpower and ~85% nodes voting for core and small blocks...

Of course it should have been clear, because 85 and 95 are these magic numbers everyone knows since elementary school. Sorry for my ignorance and thanks for reminding anyway.

What's this ""\~"" ? Heisenberg's uncertainty relation?

To be serious again: A 5% minority veto right is as arbitrary as any number, and much too low. And you cannot hide behind the ""\~"", because when deploying a SW with a rule set, you must decide for an exact number, not a rough number.

The 85% of nodes is even more ridiculous - nodes are cheap and can be multiplied easily by sibyl attack. Leave alone the fact that such a percentage couldn't be determined objectively and hence would be meaningless for any algorithm implementation.

">And right now, not all of us want hardfork to 2MB

Always the same boring argument. Of course not *all* (=100%) of us want 2MB. But even less of us want 1MB.

So staying with one MB is more controversial than a 2MB HF. Is this so difficult to understand?

"to be honest - as much as I hope for classic, as much I am afraid of BU which has a similarly radical ideology as bitcoin core in ignorance of the problems that it brings and self-justification - similarly extreme, just in opposite direction.

I am convinced BU won't work, would really harm decentralization, and scientists in the field as well as my own personal analysis and judgement clearly indicates the BU would be dangerous.

(Now I am expecting to get downvoted by the BU extremists for whom classic supporters and supporters of a careful bls limit increase are just as evil as core, and only the BU ideology is acceptable.)";1;0;False;Amichateur;d4x7axf;Wow, Chinese Miners Revolt and Announce Terminator Plan to Hard Fork to 2M, Big Fuck to Core (cross-post);4qk7et;http://8btc.com/thread-35645-1-1.html
