"Specifically they fanboy over Gregory Maxwell, which anyone with any sense would abhor as a person. Its not like they can claim ignorance, they added a dynamic blocksize algorithm because of the btc blocksize debate, so its not like they live in their own bubble of ignorance. Its a matter of principle, if you willingly associate with snakes and even go as far as defending their character, you become an apologist for evil, which is not what I joined the whole crypto movement for.

There's also the issue of fluffypony taking those pics with core shills wearing USAF hats and doing the D for dragons den like its funny or something, I mean seriously wheres the professionalism? They also don't seem to think fees are an issue by claiming its the price of privacy but at the same claiming they are going reduce them in the near future.

The fee problem is basically the fees have to be a static value or your transactions could be linked just by looking at what fee amounts you are sending with your transactions, so they centrally planned a specific fee value with multipliers for low/medium/high priorities. So the price of Monero goes up and suddenly your fees are several dollars each, its not like Monero sees heavy use, the blocks are real small compared to bitcoin yet the transaction sizes are roughly x50 bigger. Its already totally unacceptable fee levels, the only thing you should ever buy with Monero is expensive illegal drugs.

The user experience is still dogshit, even with the GUI wallet they made, I found out the hard way when I wanted to dump all my holdings, I had to wait 2 hours for my wallet client to sync and I wasn't even downloading the blockchain, I was using a remote node. Why I can't make an instant transaction like with exodus wallet I don't even know, its almost 2018, there's no excuse for having a poor user experience. It even crashed when I tried to do a test transaction and I had to resync the whole thing again.

They don't have the solid background in economics big blockers in btc were always known for, you can hardly claim they believe in free markets. The only consistent ideology with Monero is that privacy is important. If that's all they have, personally that does not inspire confidence in me.

"There's a very, very vocal group of Bitcoin (Core) enthusiasts who have a lot of money tied up in Bitcoin. To them, the failings of Bitcoin as a currency don't matter because they're using it as an investment. They will lose a lot of money if more people switch from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Cash so they smear Bitcoin Cash very loudly on the internet.

Their chief complaint is that using ""Bitcoin"" in the name ""Bitcoin Cash"" is deceptive because  people who intend to buy BTC might accidentally buy BCH. Basically that Bitcoin Cash is a scam trying to take advantage of the Bitcoin name. On the other side, BCH advocates argue that they're entitled to use the name because BCH is closer to the ""true"" vision of Bitcoin as laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin Cash supporters maintain that the project known as ""Bitcoin Core"" (the original Bitcoin) has gone astray from the values laid out in the original Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin Core is now more useful as a long-term store of value (like gold or real estate) than it is as an everyday currency. The transaction fees to send Bitcoin have skyrocketed into the neighborhood of $20 per transaction (unless you want your transaction to take days to go through, if it even goes through at all). If you're sending millions of dollars internationally that's a pretty small fee compared to what a bank wire would cost you, but if you're trying to buy a pizza or a purchase a game on Steam it's absurdly high.  In the past, the sub-penny fees and near-instant transactions were *the* selling points of Bitcoin, so you can understand why some people feel that Bitcoin has strayed from it's original vision.

Bitcoin Cash is a project that splintered off from the original Bitcoin project and uses much of the same codebase, with some important differences: most notably Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks which keeps fees down and keeps transactions moving quickly.

I'm not as well-versed on the arguments against Bitcoin cash from the opposing side but I do know that they take issue with us using the word ""Bitcoin"" in the name. They call it ""Bcash"" to make it seem unconnected to Bitcoin. Also any post that isn't entirely critical of Bitcoin Cash will be deleted from /r/Bitcoin so /r/BTC is the only place left for uncensored discussion of both projects.

Tldr: the original Bitcoin now only makes sense for investors and rich people looking for a place to stash their money long-term. If you're looking for a decentralized currency that can be used for small everyday purchases by poor or middle-class people all over the world (which was the initial vision for Bitcoin), Bitcoin Cash is the answer.";16;3;False;mayormcsleaze;drokixd;"Tor Project: ""Due to the current state of the Bitcoin market, our payment processor, Bitpay, will not allow us to accept donations of less than 100 USD.

"At least in traditional applications what you have when you try to verticalize is that eventually you hit a cost wall because your volume increased faster than costs have come down. For instance, the application I'm working on saw a 5x increase in volume since last year, and hardware costs have actually come up a little in my country since then. But our application is distributed and adding 5x more instances is way cheaper than buying a single machine that can transact 5x more.

Cost doesn't increase linearly with capacity increase. Let's say you have a tradicional SQL based app. The system is centralized and can process 10tps. You buy a bigger machine for 2x the price that gives you double the capacity. Then you try to double that again, but now you have an 1.5x increase. Eventually you'll end up with a machine that costs you a couple of millions and all you have is 100tps.

Now, going back to your question, eventually the blocksize hit a wall that makes it very expensive for most machines trying to process a block, because for any successful business out there, the user base and volume usually grows at a way faster rate than hardware costs go down. Home users can't just double their bandwidth contract every few months, it usually take years for most people to see an increase, while miners and mining pools can because they're getting paid and can afford it. 

Of course, that's no excuse to keep the limit so low today. ";1;1;False;likeboats;drp7c1b;Pineapple Fund Update: Homes in Haiti, Education for Girls, and a $1100 tx fee on bitcoin :(;7lnu9w;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lnu9w/pineapple_fund_update_homes_in_haiti_education/

This has more to do with the cost of parallelization, no?

Those running full nodes presumably have some skin in the game, and are doing it to verify the blockchain for themselves, while also helping out the network a bit. There is a broader issue that there is little incentive to run a ""full node"" besides to help yourself.

However, all miners also take on the role of a full node, right? Or is that wrong? My thinking is that once you've mined a block, it obviously benefits you to propagate that block to the network quickly.

[One correction with what I said. This is a pretty embarrassing oversight on my part, but a fast exponential divided by a slow exponential gives you a slow exponential, not a constant. However there is another factor - if the *price* keeps going up exponentially, then you have exponentially more justification to want to verify the blockchain for yourself. However, I don't like that this is dependent on price appreciation. Any thoughts?

>Of course, that's no excuse to keep the limit so low today.

You might have not foreseen the move to specialized hardware, but to anyone with half a brain, it was *quite* clear that people will move to specialized HW. The economic reasons for this is absolutely crystal clear.

network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to
specialists with server farms of **specialized hardware.**

"If Satoshi thought he had all the solutions and if he believed this project should only proceed according to his ""original vision"" he would've done the following:
A. He wouldn't have made this thing open source to minimize divergence from his original plan
B. He would've stuck around and forced his opinion down everyone's throats
C. Hell with it, he wouldn't even have designed it to be decentralized, he would've just made it another paypall type company with him as the CEO to guide the ""original plan""

He didn't do any of that to de-emphasize the original plan and leave room for evolution and growth.

That being said I personally believe BCH to be closer to the 2012-14 bitcoin. I am supporter of the direction it is going. But that shouldn't stop any group of people pursuing their vision of bitcoin. The ""original vision"" is exactly this; us figuring out which and however many ways to go with this thing.

"If it's trivial to get to 300tps, why is Ethereum starting to hit its scaling limit at 27tps equivalent?

Here is my math:

8,000,000 gas limit per block right now. Normal non-smart transaction costs 21,000 gas. That means 8M/21K = 380tx/block. 1 block every 14 sec means 380/14 = 27tx/sec that Ethereum could do right at this moment if there were no smart contract transactions.

Ethereum already has an increasing uncle rate; the equivalent in Bitcoin would be a rise in orphaned blocks due to propagation time.

[According to Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/31/uncle-rate-transaction-fee-analysis/), scalability on the main chain is very limited from this point on:

> There is a limit to how much scalability is possible on a single chain, with the primary bottleneck being disk reads and writes, so after some point (likely 10-40 million gas) sharding will be the only way to process more transactions.

Even 40 million gas is still only 136tx/sec. Is that because Ethereum's disk access pattern is more inefficient than Bitcoin's? Maybe, but I find it hard to believe.

"**No-communication theorem**

In physics, the no-communication theorem is a no-go theorem from quantum information theory which states that, during measurement of an entangled quantum state, it is not possible for one observer, by making a measurement of a subsystem of the total state, to communicate information to another observer. The theorem is important because, in quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement is an effect by which certain widely separated events can be correlated in ways that suggest the possibility of instantaneous communication. The no-communication theorem gives conditions under which such transfer of information between two observers is impossible. These results can be applied to understand the so-called paradoxes in quantum mechanics, such as the EPR paradox, or violations of local realism obtained in tests of Bell's theorem.

"We can go far beyond Visa just by increasing blocksize. Did you see the recent terabyte blocks article?

In any case, this idea that mined blockchains don't scale only comes from the weird notion that non-mining nodes have anything to do with the security of the system, a notion that has clearly also infected Ethereum. It looks like effectively all the altcoins are based on Core's idea there. 

Only BCH is based on Satoshi's vision, where the network is *only* a network of miners. Everyone else just watches from the sidelines; they don't ""participate."" If you wanna play (in the hashvoting=validation process), you gotta pay. No one gets a say for free. Not a democracy, a hashocracy. No vote without investment (anything else is the very definition of a Sybil attack!). 

There is no role for non-mining ""nodes"" (a silly name when they aren't even participating in the Nakamoto-consensus-process network) in relaying for, validating blocks for, securing, or decentralizing the mining network, which becomes obvious when you consider the mining network topology that arises from the incentives on miners, namely to prioritize network resources to connecting to nodes proportionally with their demonstrated hashpower. That means connections to nodes with zero demonstrated hashpower are of minimal or no priority. The network systematically cuts the sockpuppet miners (Core's darling ""full nodes"") out of the loop, as they (and their uber-inefficient mesh-network topology) are deadweight on the mining network, like shriveled leaves on a vine. Miners connect to each other in a nearly direct all-to-all topology, called a ""nearly complete graph"" or ""small-world network."" 

It is many orders of magnitude faster and harder to attack. Core and apparently Ethereum and many other altcoins have been trying to compete in NASCAR with their emergency brake engaged.

It's an important perspective (and his thoughts here are very valuable), but Satoshi couldn't predict the entire developmental process of cryptocurrencies: this is an industry in its infancy. There will be many ideas (both good and bad) that will spawn from his single white paper. Those which the market prefers (and are best supported by existing infrastructure, to help transition to a digital market) will be adopted most broadly, and become dominant in the world economy.

"What would the size of the blockchain grow to? You have to remember this was said during a peak in moore's law. Computational power was doubling every 18 months.

Since then moore's law has been collapsing. Computational power and storage capacity isn't growing at the same rate as it was in 2009. Processor speed, as well as storage capacity growth has been slowing as we reach the limits of our manufacturing ability.

If large block only blockhain saw mass adoption, the blockchain would grow exponentially, but our technology for processing and storage isn't.

Your assertions that tech is getting faster and cheaper is just plain incorrect. CPU speeds are hitting walls, storage capacity isn't growing much, memory prices have doubled in the last year alone. The average persons internet access speed isn't growing very quickly at all. Sure more people have access to high bandwidth now, but those who already have high bandwidth connections aren't seeing a doubling in speed year over year. Yet alone increases that would be needed for a massive blockchain. Moore's law that was applicable when this was wrote, is now dead. 

If large block blockchain gained global acceptance, the blockchain would grow so large that only those with access to very powerful systems would be able to handle it.

"Point is, we never ran into any empirical issues with his design (we did with Core's jonny-come-lately design), yet now practically everyone - big blocker or small - has this idea that the original design had non-mining nodes operating as some kind of defender of decentralization and security. This notion is immediately shut down by reading Satoshi. 

This puts the ""full node"" ideology in a very different light: it's demonstrably something added to Bitcoin after Satoshi left, a fundamental change pioneered by mostly the same people who stand to profit massively from the change. 

High fee coin is a dumb idea, but it is crucial to understand that it wasn't the original idea. Bitcoin Cash is the only one that follows Satoshi's vision, the one everyone who read the whitepaper should have known they were investing in.

"That’s assuming there will eventually be *zero* people willing to host a node.

Total Nodes might decrease, but there will always be people willing to run nodes up to a point. The majority of people aren’t running on a Raspberry Pi connected via Dialup.

As for me personally, I’m willing to run a node up until blocks are about 10-15Mb. That’s what I can spare *right now*. In 5 or so years, I’m sure I’ll be willing to support much larger blocks than that.

Increasing blocksize to 2Mb shouldn’t affect a noticeable amount of nodes at all. (Nobody should expect to run the same hardware for 7+ years without *any* upgrades, anyways)

Now, what *does* decrease the node count is when Bitcoin itself becomes unusable for anything other than as a store of value.

"By ""nodes"" Satoshi generally meant ""miners."" There haven't been fewer miners as blocksize has grown, but in fact the opposite. Mining has become significantly *more* decentralized, and the reason is obvious: as Bitcoin gets adopted (hinging on its capacity!), the price increases and more diverse interests start getting into mining. When we are hitting gigablocks, there will probably be thousands of mining pools with no single pool having nearly as much hashrate as a major pool today. 

Thus we have bigger servers needed yet more total. Paradox? No, because the entire pie is much bigger.

Also, miners can just switch pools if the pool doesn't do what they want. Any time you start thinking of decentralization as measuring something other than immunity to attack, you've gone off the rails. ""Full nodes"" that do not mine have nothing whatsoever to do with decentralization. ";2;0;False;ForkiusMaximus;drpqzxs;Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008: Visa processes 100 million transactions per day.

"A few things to be careful of when reading:

- Keep track of context. Some statements might seem to contradict each other, like when it says at the very end that any needed rule changes can be made through hashpower voting whereas he says earlier, ""This does not throw open the system to arbitrary changes."" In context there is no contradiction: ""This"" refers to a malicious miner having the majority of hashpower, and ""arbitrary changes"" refers to, as it says in the next part of the sentence, stealing coins or mining extra coins. All Satoshi is saying here is that a 51% attack cannot steal coins or create inflation, but ""only"" undo confirmed transactions the miner has sent. Still a very damaging and potentially fatal attack, but he is just noting it not quite as bad as you might think. It has nothing to do with how the rules are decided. 

- When Satoshi says ""node"" he almost exclusively means ""miner."" 


- Read his first replies on the mailing list for additional clarification: http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/

- Read the many comments in the original release code and associated files such as the [readme.txt](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/readme.txt) where he clearly says if you are not mining you are not contributing to the network. Bitcoin is a mining network. Nodes that don't mine are only nodes in that they could one day decide to mine; they're essentially dormant nodes, fake miners, Sybil miners. They play a role only for users needing a few perks like faster confirmation certainty and 0-confirmation transaction acceptance, not for network security nor for decentralization.

- Most importantly, read Section 8: Simplified Payment Verification very carefully and in context with the rest of the paper. Note well that the phrase [""overpowered by an attacker""](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-243.5-243.360) there refers refers to a minority hashpower attacker who finds a few lucky blocks in a row, not a majority attacker, as this changes the entire meaning of the section because it suggests SPV requires fraud proofs to work,  which changes the entire model of the system: until we have these fraud proofs we have to have ultra-tiny blocks, and we don't have them yet. But this is completely backwards. Fraud proofs are merely mentioned as a ""nice to have"" and are certainly never mentioned as essential for decentralization or security of the system as a whole. This is the very heart of Core's error. (Check my comment history for more details.)

The language gets confused just because in the beginning he could use the term ""node"" interchangeably to refer to mining nodes and non-mining clients, since most users would be mining at first, as per his first answer on the mailing list. This was never the intended configuration at scale.

Non-mining nodes don't support the network. They contribute nothing to security of the network as a whole nor to decentralization, and they cannot defend you against doublespending attacks, which are far worse than mining extra coinbase rewards since they use perfectly valid blocks. For this same reason, a non-mining node cannot defend against a hashpower majority who wants to change the rules - the majority can just doublespend your chain into oblivion even if you can get a sizable minority to mine on it.

Non-mining nodes also cannot exert a significant influence on the network, such as through supposed ""user-activated forks,"" because the mining network mainly doesn't relay through non-mining nodes: it's an all-to-all topology among all the significant mining pools, a nearly complete graph rather than a mesh network. Think what a terrible system it would be if just running a piece of software and not investing any hashpower could affect network consensus! If that were true, running a large number of these non-hashing clients would be a form of Sybil attack. Yet this is what Core developers are pushing for.

They further build on their faulty model by including non-mining nodes in the network and thus thinking it is a mesh network, when Bitcoin is actually a mining network. That is the network described in the whitepaper. The software was originally set up so that miners automatically prioritize connections to the most productive other miners over the least productive - and the very least for non-mining nodes after they demonstrate they never end up mining any blocks. In this way the network ""learns"" to route around the non-mining nodes and leave them to listen from the sidelines. It is routing around the deadweight of fake miners (incongruously called ""full nodes"").

Bitcoin is decentralized by competitive mining incentives, not warm bodies running non-mining nodes.

"I agree on the amazing white paper that started this whole new era.  It is incredible.   

I am not saying this in defense or core or as an attack against bitcoin cash, but it is extremely short sided to point to a 10 year old design to prove an argument one way or another.   

Those that believe bitcoin must be used for daily peer to peer transactions have been heard by forking off with a solution they deem safe and secure and achieves the original intent.   Why must we continue to argue day and day out .   

At this point, sad as it is,  neither bitcoin or bitcoin cash are the leading software or best tech for achieving scalable txns.   This incessant fighting will inevitably destroy both sides and enable a competitor to take over.
 
As of now,  there isn’t even a demand for a high volume of txns other than speculators lookin to get rich.   If there was a demand, why don’t we see more usage of bitcoin cash.   looks like bitcoin is seeing 10 times the activity as cash.   

All said, i love the underlying tech more than the practical use case for my personal life.  I get it has value for many different people in many different applications.    I just wish this fighting would stop.    both forums are 90% about bashing or attempting to defame the other side in some way.

Referencing satoshis original intent doesn’t accomplish much.   If the main goal is to create software that can achieve what you want, haven’t you succeeded?   The only reason i can think of to become the original / real bitcoin is to increase the worth of your investment.   If increasing ones wealth was satoshis main goal,  core is achieving that.

"I've a quick question that I was hoping people could comment on.

I sold all my BTC the second BCH went on coinbase (I know........I really should have been in much earlier but I still got a decent price). I'm just sitting waiting now.......surely it's only a matter of time until the cashening happens with the cost of transactions and mining. What concerns me is that nearly every exchange you need BTC to buy BCH hence as BTC falls so does BCH, and vice versa.
