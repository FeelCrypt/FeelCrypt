"The issue you are talking about is more for companies that want to engage in speculative activities. Most companies today (like Steam) aren’t interested in playing that game.

A typical US based retail company would more than likely convert to USD immediately and record it as such on their financial statements at the time of transaction. They must also account for the gain or loss from foreign currency transactions (which Bitcoin is) that occurred as a result of exchange rate fluctuations between the time the sale was recorded and payment was received, modern accounting systems automatically do this for established currencies and it’s usually relatively small fluctuations (per transaction) due to price stability.

"Not OP, but can help -

Currency ultimately is a tool for exchanging stuff that's hard to exchange. I want my house painted today, you want five massages next month. Those might be equal value right now, but it's a lot easier if I can just hand you $100 and then you can hand me back $20 five times.

Money supply increasing is generally good because it incentives you to use it. If I gave you a dollar and told you that you had to give me 1 cent a day until you were out of money, you'd go spend it today, not wait ten weeks until you only have 30 cents left. Inflation is less severe, but the same idea.

Deflationary currency has the problem that once someone has money, they don't want to spend it, and it's really really hard to convince them to spend it. In that situation, I buy that house painting and you never buy the massages from me. Now the town just has $100 less money going around, and money gets even more valuable, because even fewer people are spending money, so money gets more valuable.....

Currency management is largely about making sure money is growing a little, but not a looooot and definitely not shrinking.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies generally take the position that money management is bad, and are built to 'avoid manipulation'. The problem is, that doesn't actually make them difficult to manipulate. In fact, it makes it impossible to PREVENT manipulation.

If someone tried to do with the dollar what is happening with bitcoin right now, the government could just print more, and once the person manipulating it gives up, they could take the excess back out of circulation. But nobody can make more bitcoin - at least not very quickly at all. So there's nothing anyone can do if someone manipulates it.";28;1;False;KBatWork;dqvuqib;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"Maybe I didn't word what I meant to say correctly but wtf are you talking about? 

I'm saying if I had Bitcoin and it was increasing in value rapidly I'd probably still spend some of it while keeping some in savings to grow, or burst.. 

I haven't been investing in cryptocurrency, but I have followed the Bitcoin over the last 5 years, unfortunately more recently than in the past but alas.. 

I see why you would want my business, but I guess my thinking was, if someone is willing to part with a thing that only becomes more valuable the longer you hold it (temporarily) as I doubt the btc keeps going up and never down again, I'd probably rather be taking that currency than refusing it.

Idk now that I'm not also at work and I'm thinking this out, I can see where it's not really a good move for a business to accept them.

 At the same time I think if I had say, paid for $100 of btc early on, and left it alone until now, I'd have way more. Duh. There's products I want that can be bought with btc and you even usually get a sweet discount. I'd be really psyched right now to spend some btc assuming I bought in and my 100 bucks was now worth, idk $1000+ at this point? 

I'd absolutely use them sparingly but damn if there's not stuff I'd be buying if I had btc from buying in cheap. Even buying in high I think I'd be spending at this point I'm not confident that it's gonna stay above 10k, but I don't think I know anything so if I'm totally off base with my thinking, I wouldn't mind constructive criticism.

Yeah it's all on record but it's more like a cash exchange where you need to know the code for the transaction or else you can't trace it and that code is something that only the two people making the transaction should have access to. So they can tell others about it and then they can check which I guess is good for court but realistically I can't just go into some block chain and find some transaction you made buying a pound of weed from Canada without something else to go on. The problem up until now was that it was very hard to get money onto the internet without first going through a bank because companies really only accept credit or debit cards and sometimes bank wires. So buying drugs when your bank has a record of every transaction that courts can then demand from the bank isn't a super safe way to do things. This lead to the stolen credit/debit card market since you essentially had to impersonate someone else and pray they didnt trace it back to you. So yeah it can be traced but it's value comes from the fact that it can only be traced if one of the two party members wants it to be, or I guess if someone put a virus on your computer to track it. Or I should say initial value as the value that bitcoin currently has is way more than it should be for some drug currency, which was my whole point anyway. ;2;0;False;deftwolf;dqw0slr;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"> BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features

I believe this to be incorrect.  since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

Perhaps BTC isn't the crypto which is ultimately mass-adopted.  There are so many competing cryptos out there, it's very hard to predict.  Maybe it will be Bitcoin Cash, maybe Monero.

You seem to be well informed.  You're looking at this from the supply side and that's a great start.  Let's look at the demand side.

Tell me, if an opt-in money *wasn't* deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

> That's not going to change. Quote me on that. Come back in the future and enjoy your ""I told you so"" if BTC ever amounts to anything (it won't).

I first heard that in 2011.   Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.  It is still very marginal: I expect global crypto adoption to require generations of humans and possibly some wars unfortunately.  But as long as people foresee a future in it, then they will continue to devote additional wealth to it.  And as long as it is super-easy and cheap to transact (definitely not always the case, see my earlier points) then sooner or later people heavy in it will want to spend it.  And there will be others eager to accept it in exchange, because it will be widely understood to have value.";1;1;False;jessquit;dqvnabw;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

Change never comes until it's too late and it's forced upon us. Bitcoin is unusable as a currency, but because all the new people got into it because of the hype, that doesn't even matter to them. So maybe it will just keep rising for a long time... and these people will cash out with a profit and pat themselves on the back. But someone, some group of people will get the timing wrong, and it will plummet for them.

 I think it will take another, better crypto to become the new 'useful' digital currency, with mass media hype and a price rise itself, before BTC really collapses and the new buyers realise BTC is slow and pointless as a day to day currency, like it was originally intended to be. It might take so long for this to happen that they are conditioned into thinking BTC is how crypto is supposed to be, a speculative investment for life, that is inconvenient to use, just like online now no one cares that 18 months of browsing history is kept on a GCHQ server. 'Nothing to hide, nothing to fear' and all of the problems that come from that line of thinking. We've been conditioned to think that it's acceptable for a government to do that without any asking or public debate, for 'national security'. 

Maybe the next generation of people won't even think it's an issue that crypto is slow, heavily regulated and centralised on sidechains. They bought BTC and it went up, and now they can finally spend it. Fuck man, who knows what's going to happen.

"> I believe this to be incorrect. since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

This is not an **inherent** stabilizing feature.

This is stabilization based on adoption.

You're still caught in the same problem where no major retailer adopts currency because it isn't stable, and the currency requires adoption to achieve stability, so therefore it never reaches stability.

>Tell me, if an opt-in money wasn't deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

To spend it. Cryptocurrencies provide secure international transactions at no cost. There is no middle-man bank that collects wire fees. People would happily use an inflationary cryptocurrency for this alone.

Seriously, how is this even a question?

The problem is that the deflationary nature of BTC *disincentivizes* spending, and that means BTC fails at literally the #1 function of a currency.

>And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

Sure, they might prefer that.

But what you're describing here is not a currency. It's an *investment device*.

>I first heard that in 2011. Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.

**As an investment device.**

Do you understand the distinction?

People don't buy BTC to spend it. People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

It's a nice speculative investment device. It is not, however, a currency. And it will never become a currency, because it has no *inherent* stabilizing features that are necessary to promote retail adoption.

There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto.  So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented [here](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd) over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

It might one day become caught in a negative adoption feedback loop but I can't find any evidence of that.  You'll need evidence if you want to keep making assertions like that.  It's fairly demonstrable that over time, more and more people hold more and more crypto.

Yes, as a speculative investment device.   It's still in the speculative phase.  Of course I understand the distinction, I've held crypto for many years, and spent very few of them.  That's because it's rather obvious to me that its incredibly undervalued.  There are many reasons to believe that a global cryptocurrency will in fact become the next ""reserve currency.""  Will that be Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum or some other?  No way to know for sure.  Sooner or later, one of these will however hit the magic formula, and adoption will look exactly like that chart I just showed you, because all cryptos get adopted in hype cycles like Bitcoin.

> People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

Yes, more and more people do this.  Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge.  And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

And when enough people are heavy in crypto they'll want to spend them, like I enjoy spending mine, and they'll seek out ways to do that.  And as this crypto becomes globally recognized and desired, merchants will offer discounts to get it, because it costs less to transact and hold.

Traders buy and sell.  You seem focused on these.  But with every wave of adoption there are more people that buy and hold.  These are not boom speculators.  What causes these people to stop buying and holding?

"Literally everything you said about how ""BTC should do this and that if such and such happens"" is the same ridiculous fantasy that BTC apologists have been saying since its inception.

BTC will not be ""sufficiently adopted"" until major businesses are convinced that its value with respect to other assets has permanently stabilized. And its value with respect to other assets will not stabilize unless it is ""sufficiently adopted"". 

It's caught in a vicious cycle because BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features. There are no monetary levers that a government can pull to combat volatility. It is entirely at the mercy of speculation, which is why it is stuck in this limbo of never becoming a legitimate currency ever.

"Believe me, I am a big fan of blockchain tech and am very bullish on it's adoption into many industries. What I am not a fan of is speculative bubbles. Here are my thoughts:
Bitcoins have value due to the ability to trade them. They gain inherent value when more people use them. More people use them when it has a stable price. Speculation makes people who want to use it as a currency, very uneasy, hence why steam is not supporting bitcoin payments anymore. People who use it as a currency, sell it to avoid volatile prices, the people who buy are speculators. The current trajectory of bit coin makes it into a speculative medium where most bitcoins are owned by people trying to make money and not actually use it. When the drop happens, there will be less and less people using bitcoins as currency and it's inherent value will be pretty small.

"> he world has played around with decentralized limited-supply currencies before. It was called the gold standard

I thought the gold standard was the start of fractional reserve banking? ie gold became paper money, and then it was realised that they could print more paper money without people actually claiming the gold. 

Bitcoin acts nothing like this....
From the wiki article 'Gold Standard'

Disadvantages
-
The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - **Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.**

Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - **not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.**

The rest of the points seem to centre around money as debt, which is exactly what bitcoin and crypto aims to avoid. I'm not saying I don't believe what you're saying, I just can't see it yet. Can you help me understand? I don't see how money made from IOUs of gold, that add up to more than the total of real gold, is a limited-supply.

As bitcoin has grown from $0.01 to $14,000 the volatility has decreased. When the market cap is big enough, say as big as gold, the volatility will be similar as well. It is only during this initial growth phase where there is high volatility. How is bitcoin ever supposed to get to this large market cap if it isn't for these speculative bubbles? If you look at the history of bitcoin, it has had these bubbles over and over again. It will continue to do this until it is either replaced by a different cryptocurrency, or until the market is fully saturated and the market cap is sufficient to allow all trade.;3;0;False;IamSOFAkingRETARD;dqvz3u2;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

Obviously this is an extreme example.

The real reason to avoid Bitcoin isn't because it is appreciating, it's instability and risk. Because the biggest fear is that the money or investment you are holding is suddenly worth much less, people avoid anything prone to rapid fluctuations in value or boom/bust cycles -- like Bitcoin.

Right now it might be a moon rocket, but if the bubble bursts next week and the value drops in half or less, Steam doesn't want to be holding a bunch of Bitcoin and still need to pay publishers twice as much as they're worth in dollars.

"Because a currency isn't valued by how much is put into it by consumer assets or people's investments, its value is based on other currencies and the countries economy, and banks that are backing it (and also backed by other things themselves). Think of it like a very well built house of cards. It ensures, that way, that at the slightest sign of hesitation or failure, that a currency doesn't just collapse and cause a whole country to go up in ruin overnight.

To the point that nearly every major country has a central national bank that isn't for day to day loans and accounts like banks are, that is there as a ""failsafe"" in case banks fall short on their amounts or interest rates or overnight payments, etc. And basically pays the deficit so things like inflation, interest rates, currency strength, etc. Don't start changing drastically.

€: Just to be clear, here, there is *some* value put into currency through investments. I.e. Forex. It's just not navigated or treated as, say, a stock would or a corporation. The influence on a currencies well being via investments is minimal, and treated to be a lot less than what it would be through other investments. Reason for that is no one wants currencies to be backed and invested upon, solely on people's investment's and buying power, versus leaving it in the hands of the financial system and mortgaged backed securities, or banks.";3;0;False;prodigalkal7;dqw0ezj;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"**Octopus card**

The Octopus card (Chinese: 八達通) is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong, leading to the development of Oyster Card in London.

The Octopus card has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street parking meters, car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.

The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, among other things, being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

"You completely misunderstand what we're discussing here.

To borrow terminology from the redditor I responded, the ""Lightning Network"" is trying to address the issue of ""vertical"" scalability. It is essentially just layering some abstraction on top of BTC to address a network bottleneck problem. This is nothing. This is small time. It's just a band-aid. It does nothing to solve the core fundamental ideological problem that dooms BTC to failure.

What he and I are trying to argue, and agree on, is that ideological problem -- ""horizontal"" scalability. That is, the money supply is finite, and therefore the currency is inherently *deflationary*. This promotes hoarding and saving, and penalizes spending. And a currency that penalizes spending (which is literally the #1 function of a currency) is not actually a currency.

The Lightning Network does nothing to address that problem. They can add a bazillion abstraction layers to this, and BTC (and any secondary or tertiary currency based on the BTC) is still going to be deflationary in nature. Consequently, none of this stuff is ever going to become anything more than a speculative ""investment"" device.";1;1;False;bleed_air_blimp;dqvlx96;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504
">The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.

It doesn't matter that anyone can mine when the total amount of BTC available to be mined is a limited, finite quantity. Consequently, BTC is *deflationary* in nature, which promotes hoarding/saving rather than spending. And that inherently takes a big steaming dump on the most important function that a *currency* needs to perform.

>Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.

A paper currency that is gold backed is equally as infinitely divisible as BTC is. After all, there is nothing stopping the US government from stamping new coins or printing new paper that has smaller denominations than 1 cent. In fact this was one of the key reasons why the world transitioned into paper notes that were backed by precious metals. The notes could be any denomination necessary, while still being indexed to a finite commodity. That didn't stop the gold standard from being depressive on economic growth.

Ultimately, the limit on economic growth is a function of the penalty that *deflationary* currencies place on spending.  This is unavoidable. It's very basic economics. And it's why deflationary currencies can't actually be useful currencies.

I really want to stress this point: BTC is not a currency. It never was, and it never will be. It has lived its entire existence as a wildly speculative ""investment"" device. People don't buy BTC in order to spend it. They buy it to hold, and profit from the speculative booms.";1;1;False;bleed_air_blimp;dqvkd9o;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"This is a question that is not so simple to answer and needs a lot of background info, thus the long text:

Sorry, I was working and couldn't reply before. I don't know how much do you know about blockchains or how long have you been active in the scene, but am going to assume you are a complete noob in this. Don't think I am trying to be condescending, I am just simplifying everything so you would understand the situation with whatever knowledge you have.

Bitcoins idea was proposed around 10 years ago in [this whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which specifically states Bitcoin is to be a decentralized currency. Both r/bitcoin and r/btc have been around for a long time and used to be very similar to eachother. Around 2 years ago two differently thinking camps emerged around Bitcoin, having different ideas for the future:

- (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain, by making blocks in the blockchain bigger. This would mean that the currency could handle loads of transactions on the network and no organization or one group would have control over the network to profit from it (the users control the system = decentralization) and every transaction would be visible to others. This is exactly what the original idea in the whitepaper has in mind. The problem is however that the blockchain would get bigger more quickly and the nodes on the network (not ordinary users, but rather miners) would need Terabytes of storage space.

- (camp2) The other camp wants to keep blocks on Bitcoin 1MB size. This would mean limited transaction rates and thus high fees and waiting times to get your transaction through. The idea is supposedly to keep the blockchain itself small so everyone can store the data on their own devices if they want to. And moving most of transactions off of the chain onto sidechannels and something called the Lightning Network, where transactions are fast and cheap again. This move can however easily lead to companies facilitating these transactions and also benefiting off of these transactions. This is not the decentralization that the original idea had in mind and would almost be the same as nowadays banks profiting off of and controling the transactions that people make. Most people who understand the blockchain tech and want to get rid of banks hate this idea, but somehow the Core developers of Bitcoin are supporting it. A lot of conspiracies around, but people have been sniffing out some major banks and investment organizations are linked to funding the Core developers and might be pushing for Lightning Network to control Bitcoin and profit out of transactions.

This August, Bitcoin finally split into two: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin backed by the Core developers (camp2) and Bitcoin Cash backed by pretty much the rest of the community (camp1). The moderators of r/bitcoin subreddit are mostly Bitcoin developers and have been heavily censoring the subreddit towards their liking and ideas. The r/btc does not censor and thus here you can see the community hatred towards Bitcoin and support of Bitcoin Cash.

Some links:

[r/bitcoin thread in response to these accusations](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ej53t/more_information_on_the_bot_attack_of_rbitcoin/)

[The same thread, but you can see the censoring](https://ceddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ej53t/more_information_on_the_bot_attack_of_rbitcoin/)

[Bitcoin network constantly clogging up because of the 1MB block sizes seen live here.](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#2w) The upper graph shows how many transactions are waiting on the network currently to go through. Right now there are around 160k pending transactions. The average transaction fee right now is around $7. Bitcoin can never work with 1MB blocks on the chain and be a decentralized currency with low fees. The only thing it has is really at the moment, that it is ""digital gold""; ""store of value"". Bitcoin Cash with bigger block could transact much more transactions per/day, but it does not have the recognition of the average public member and not many people use it.


**TLDR**: Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash a few months ago. Bitcoin just got the name, because the original developers went that way. Bitcoin Cash follows much closer to the original idea of Bitcoin. This subreddit is pro Bitcoin Cash.

That doesn’t need to be difficult. The merchant doesn’t need to be adjusting prices of items because only conversion rate changes. So if a game is $20, the merchant just needs to advertise $20 as the price. The buyer will pay the equivalent in bitcoin according to the current conversion rate. In that sense it is not unlike paying with other foreign currency. The difference here is that the conversion rate changes happen too fast for bitcoin and by the time the merchant receives the funds, the value may be way off from the time the buyer made the payment. There is no way for merchant to be able to predict what the conversion rate will be when he receives the funds. The high fees are making it impractical to use bitcoin in retail, and that is too bad — bitcoin was not supposed to be a get-rich-quick scheme.;3;1;False;CityRobinson;dqvo20d;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
> 
> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.
> 
> We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.

"Well no shit. Some of these people literally became millionaires simply because they ran their computer over night mining Bitcoins after they heard about it on 4chan, using electricity that mummy and daddy paid for.

Of COURSE they want it to be used as a store of value because that guarantees scarceness which makes them rich.

Hell, if I held a bunch of Bitcoin I wouldn't want it to become a proper currency either! Real currencies need to remain stable and not jump up 25% one day and drop 15% the next. 

What pisses me off is I bought my first BTC and ETH in January this year. I heard about BTC for years and always regretted not getting in earlier and finally decided this year I'd dip my toes in and learn about it properly.

Later on I made a larger investment when all the alts were exploding and the $14 AUD ETH I bought was now worth $250 AUD.

I traded all my BTC for alts that sounded promising after learning about BTC's scaling issues and where has that gotten me? Stratis tanked and finally recovering slowly, Eth has gone up a bit, BAT has gone sideways... I'm probably 1.5X's more initial investment. Nothing to cry about but I would have made more investing that back into my business.

Meanwhile, if I left my entire investment in a shitcoin with no scaling, no use cases, a divided community I would have made like 5X profit.

"An ""on-chain"" transaction is just a normal transaction, it uses the block chain for validation.  This is what people mean by ""transaction"" 99% of the time.

An ""off-chain"" transaction is something that bypasses the block chain and uses some other way to validate the transaction.  Example would be the Lightning Network that Bitcoin Core is working on.

Block size refers to how much data can be included in a single ""block"" on the block chain.  Bitcoin has a 1MB hard-coded limit in the block size, which means there is a limit to how many transactions can be processed, and that doesn't scale well.  This is a problem today as evidenced by high transaction fees and slow confirmation times with Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin Cash's solution was to increase this block size.  Bitcoin's solution is to do some things separately from the block chain (""off-chain"").  One (of many) problems with this is that the technology doesn't exist to do this yet, so for now Bitcoin Cash works and Bitcoin doesn't - that's why Steam dropped support for Bitcoin.";3;1;False;wildmaiden;dqvyv80;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"Did you read their statement?

>they sell something and get 50$ in bitcoins. Bitcoins getting more expensive only gives them more money, 60$ for example

That assumes the price is only ever going up. If it is a bubble, and the bubble pops, they may lose all the gains. Generally, businesses don't like added risk. It's why they buy insurance. They'd prefer less volatility, even if they get a little bit less for it.

And the quickly moving price makes it a pain in the ass to deal with when it comes to slow transaction times and high transaction fees. You buy a game, but the transaction takes a long time, and the price drops 8% in that time. Now what? Pay another transaction fee and send the rest? Cancel the sale and have them send the money back to you? Who pays that transaction cost? Pay the rest with a credit card? That defeats the purpose in the first place

"The Bitcoin (BTC) network can handle about 3 people making a transaction each second.

Each transaction pays a (small) fee to whichever miner adds it to the ledger called the blockchain.

When there are more transactions than a miner can fit into the block that he is adding to the ledger (which in BTC has a maximum size), he chooses the transactions that make him the most money.

Because there are consistently more than 3 people per second wanting to make a transaction with BTC, they all are bidding up the fee that makes they're transaction more desirable to a miner.

So all of this means that the small fee from before is now a fairly sizable fee. While Steam isn't directly paying that fee, any time they process a refund they have to pay that fee, and they've been running into issues where they've had to do more refunds than average on specifically BTC purchases - customers would send Steam BTC but would get outbid on their fee and thus their transaction would get ""stuck"". Because Steam hasn't received money yet they don't consider the sale complete and don't give the customer the game they want, so the customer asks for a refund.

All of this costs Steam more money and hassle (which is money because you have to train employees in how to handle it) than it gains them, so they've stopped accepting BTC.";3;0;False;Dasque;dqwhqw5;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

I think the misunderstanding here is that people buying bitcoin are actually looking at it as a currency. IMO to probably 90% of people, if not more, bitcoin is an investment not a currency. To some bitcoin is currency and they think they everyone should use it and USD is satan. However I think that the true value of bitcoin is more like gold. No one actually uses gold as a currency anymore, however it is seen as like the fallback currency or an investment which is why it is worth so much. I don't know if it will continue to grow until it catches up to gold or if it will fall but no one really does. In reality most people putting money into bitcoin are doing so expecting that it will continue to grow and so long as more and more people start to think that it is a good investment the more it will grow. It does have some inherent value as a currency sure, as it is kind of like online cash that can't really be traced outside of the two people who exchanged the money which is great for things like drugs, however we're well past that point.;2;1;False;deftwolf;dqvurw3;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"> (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain

Let's take a note of something.  This was always the plan for Bitcoin.  [The project's creator was quite clear about that](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) and until 2011 or so nobody would have questioned that it would be removed long before it was an economic factor.  [The change was foisted on us.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

Now understand, one of the main reasons someone holds a crypto - any consensus (blockchain) crypto -  is the idea that ""nobody controls your currency, nobody can inflate or arbitrarily change the economics of the system without your consent.""  ""Even the devs?"" you might ask.  ""no not even the devs, if they do something you don't like, we can always fork.""

Well, the economics of the system **were** changed without our consent (this is what a soft fork does), so we hard-forked to BCH.

BTC might or might not grow up to be something one day.  Who knows.  But the system appears unusable now and in the foreseeable future.  The point is quite simple: BCH (the original plan) is still *just the better plan.*

Now maybe us libertarians are the minority now and the rest of the noobs jumping into Bitcoin BTC to get rich quick don't care about privacy or AML or ever spending them on anything but US Dollars but I think that the original idea of making onchain Bitcoin into a global currency or bringing financial sovereignty to 3 billion unbanked was pretty hip and *way* more disruptive than anything proposed from the BTC camp, which seems much more like ""banking enablement technology"" to me.

Well considering crypto is designed in part to take power away from the state and central banks that seems like a stretch. That's like an Illuminati level conspiracy theory with people thinking decades ahead. It is however reasonable to believe that governments might eventually concede to the idea of a digital blockchain currency but force their way into the system so that they can still control the monetary supply. Obviously the biggest hurdle would be that this would likely mean that the same government that decided big banks were too big to fail a decade ago will now think that big banks are completely unnecessary. I remain skeptical of how it'll get done but my cynicism tells me that we'll end up with the convenience of Bitcoin minus the convenience of physical cash and minus the economic benefits of crypto;4;1;False;Kevo_CS;dqvyk4l;As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method;7hzklb;https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/938459631449493504

"Fundamentally there is a tremendous value to an honest ledger that anyone can use -- and it's more valuable the less that ledger costs to use, and the more people it supports. Bitcoin has lost its use due to artificial constraints placed on capacity, and it's therefore worth a lot less than the market is pricing it at currently.


This is coming from someone (and from a lot of people) who have made a lot of money by correctly buying Bitcoin years ago and predicting the price increase, back when Bitcoin was intended to scale. Now that it isn't intended to scale anymore, I'm really curious why people still think it's worth something.

The market is wrong all the time, and I'm fairly confident it's wrong right now. But it will figure things out eventually. Traders make money by correctly betting against the market during times when the market is wrong.

"Who says the ""customer"" is going to pay for the LN ramps? The way I see it, your bank will have your Bitcoins for you, and they will have LN channels open with companies (Amazon, whatever) for a monthly fee + limiting LN usage to small businesses not controlled by Wall Street.

Customers won't pay fees, would have a very convenient way of securing their Bitcoins and both banks and big comanies would be benefited.

For example in case of Eth the number of nodes are growing not dropping: https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1 Having said that, BTC has appr. 4x as many as ETH nodes, which may be due to a smaller more affordable blockchain size, which translates to a much more decentralized and safe network.

The fast and cheap transactions will likely only be realized on sidechains and second and third layers of Bitcoin, because those don't require all the hundreds of millions of transactions per day (that we expect in a year or two) to be all archived on the main chain bloating it to become a monster. The main chain would only provide security for these other layers to work safely in extremely fast, like Ethereum or literally instantly. No more waiting for confirmations or looking up things on explorers. While you are not transacting on the main chain directly (only indirectly), you're enjoying virtually the same level of security, and dramatically improved user experience.";1;0;False;binarygold;dqwrly5;History made: 150k Unconfirmed Transactions;7i604n;https://i.redd.it/gtbpdz7aqh201.png

"I would agree that the mempool alone or fees alone or price alone, are not a good metrics for measuring whether Bitcoin is succeeding or not.

In the end, a lot depends on what you see Bitcoin as.  If you are one of the recent ""Store of Value"" converts, then only one of those metrics matters to you.  It would be nice, if they took time to get educated and understand what makes Bitcoin valuable, but none of us can make anyone else do anything.

If you, as I do, see Bitcoin as peer to peer cash that would enable you to transact without banks or other third parties, then the first two metrics are very important. They are measuring the health of the blockchain, though I would say that the percentage of (nearly) full blocks is also important.

So I guess, one's perspective on whether BTC is good or bad, is partly or largely based on how one intends to (not) use it.  I feel that the issues surrounding the Core developers, the censorship of the rBitcoin sub and the coercion and general ugliness of the whole lot, also speaks to how broken it is.";1;0;False;jcrew77;dqx37t6;History made: 150k Unconfirmed Transactions;7i604n;https://i.redd.it/gtbpdz7aqh201.png
"You are correct that the number of unconfirmed transactions is not a measurment of the health of the network per se. But people are exited because it is growing rapidly at the upper bands and fees are rising. Nobody cares about low fee transactions. They are irrelevant in deciding which transactions are included in the next block. Only the higest paid fees are. 

You seem to be under the the impression that there are multiple reasons for high fees and that people are acting emotionally driving the price up. This is very very wrong!

The height of the fee is decided 100% rationally by the market. If the influx of transactions (at the top) is higher than the output (fits in a block), more competition, fees will go up. If the output is higher, less competition, fees will go down.

Here you have, what I feel is very obviously, an incorrect belief.  That SPAM is blocking up the mempool and causing it to look ""scary"".  All of the available data does not support this belief.  So you have claimed that the data is flawed.  Then claimed that the means of analyzing the data are flawed.  You have the blockchain downloaded?  You can do the analysis yourself, you can see with your very own eyes that SPAM (whatever ones definition of that is today) is not the issue.  It is that transactions are coming into the mempool at over the ~2200/block that they are going out and SPAM has nothing to do with it.  That the fees are increasing, to try and compete to get into the next block.  That the increase in value of Bitcoin is driving up the value of the transactions and that the little to non-existent SPAM is doing nothing.

Another person who had similar beliefs to you, claimed the SPAM attacks stopped once Bitcoin Cash forked.  Of course no one has any evidence of any SPAM attack, they just have a belief.

"No, that's not what I'm saying.

In order to have 10 million (more realistic than billion) dollars in dogecoin: approximately 3 billion. That's roughly average daily volume traded.

Because you're buying up all the liquidity of doge on the market the price will move the market up by 5-50%, because traders will think there is a pump going on. Now, once the other party wants to sell, it goes the other way around. The market will think it's crashing and thus the price moves down. Thus your spread between buying and selling could be 10+%. Thus you lose millions in the spread to move 10 million. This is shared cost between the two parties, but still creates a problem for large transactions. The fact that you used $0.01 instead of $10 to send the doge is negligible.

With BTC the liquidity is so high it would virtually not move the price in any direction. You can get 650 BTC relatively easily. The spread will be well below 1%.

With larger volume coins, the spread is lower, but still high. So the large the amount the more beneficial to use BTC.

Now, you may ask, why do you need to buy it or sell it at all? Well, the reality is large purchases usually include at least a partial buy or sell on one side. It's unlikely / rare that both parties have the available coins and willing to keep them fully, especially not alt coins. Usually there is a seller who wants crypto for his stuff, and thus willing to give a deal to receive it, but the buyer doesn't have it yet, so he has to buy it on an exchange. Or the buyer has crypto, but the buyer needs to cover some other cost from the incoming coins, so they have to sell at least some for dollars.";5;1;False;binarygold;dqwi0r6;History made: 150k Unconfirmed Transactions;7i604n;https://i.redd.it/gtbpdz7aqh201.png

"There are limits on the mempool size which are set by each node.  Also, each node can set minimum fee levels below which it won't accept entries into its mempool.  If a node is correctly configured with regard to the hardware it's running on it should not crash when the mempool fills up.  (But this assumes the code handling the limits isn't buggy, and I wouldn't trust this.)  There is no single limit on the size of the mempool, since there are thousands of nodes each with their own limits.

As to transaction rates.  If the network can clear 5 transactions per second and transactions arrive at 6 transactions per second, then the number of transactions will grow by 1 transaction every second (on average).  This would go on to infinity, with no more increase the the transaction rate required provided reality didn't set in.  Reality would set in two ways:  the limits set by nodes are reached, or customers quit making transactions.

Today the mempool is just about to hit the same level as november in transaction count - its already bigger in MB terms and has about $1.2m in fees.

"Yeah the map is basically bogus.. or at least very very error-prone (low signal to noise ratio).

I actually don't know how they do it but if I were to design a system I would do the following: have a bunch of 'feeler' nodes connected to a bunch of different nodes located in all the regions around the world (location based on IP) and have all the feeler nodes listen for TX's.  The nodes communicate with each other using some extra sidechannel protocol so they can figure out who saw which TX first. 

Sort of like triangulating the TX's origin point based on how fast it propagated and in which directions.

This is unreliable though unless you try and connect to EVERY node on the network -- because if you miss a node a tx may appear to come from say China when really it came from a node in Australia that the China node was connected to.  Add to that --lots of tx's come in from TOR networks which are anyone's guess about actual location.

So yeah, it's mostly bogus... but makes for a pretty picture.

My point is that if you used BTC to buy a Lambo tomorrow, i doubt you would even look twice at the Tx fee because its a drop in the bucket - **but** if you were using a Credit Card it would be a sizeable amount (~$1K?)

"The reason for people to buy Bitcoin now is ""I want to get rich"". This is stated under the euphemism ""It's a store of value"". You know it's a euphemism because Bitcoin as it is, is terrible as a store of value. You never know how much value you can get out of the ""store"" on any given day. ""But it generally goes up in the long run"" - aha, so you're not storing value, you're making a speculative investment. Historically other things went up over time until all of a sudden they didn't.

Getting in to get rich is fundamentally unsustainable. Everyone is just hoping that other people do the same, but it requires larger amounts of $$ the bigger it gets. It has to have some basis of utility or it all ends badly when the market finally turns.

So I’m wondering the same thing.  If BTC is so useless (and I think it’s usefulness diminishes as its price increases), why are people still buying it up?;1;1;False;KruiserIV;dqwfr8u;BitPay CEO: “If people can’t engage in commerce, it’s hard to imagine why they’d want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place”;7i1top;https://i.redd.it/a8y5tiqwqd201.png
