"> If that's true, why would Maxwell be in favor of the witness discount for segwit transactions? Your whole argument is based on the incorrect assumption that they want on-chain transactions to be more expensive.

There are two reasons for Maxwell to favour the witness discount.

1. It allowed SegWit to be pitched as a scaling solution rather than just a major change to transaction format. Scaling was/is desperately needed by the whole community. The other effects of SegWit are mostly just useful to people building off-chain/2nd layer “stuff” - like Blockstream.

2. The capacity added by SegWit only benefits signature heavy transactions.

"As we've been saying for YEARS, under Greg Maxwell's vision of Bitcoin, anyone remotely interested in using Bitcoin without paying exorbitant fees will need to adopt sidechains, and Blockstream *just so happens* to be in a position to profit from these sidechain development efforts.

Sidechains *benefit* from a crippled Bitcoin mainnet. And because successful adoption of sidechains will increase the value of the Blockstream company's equity, people like Greg Maxwell, who've acquired equity in Blockstream, have the express financial incentive to cripple Bitcoin mainnet in order to profit.

It pains me to see lead developers of a project with unnecessary COIs like this. No one in that position deserves to be spared of criticism.

"Sadly history is replete with this type of rent seeking and it's arguably the number one problem we face as a society. The typical story goes like this.

Company X cannot compete openly in the free market so they conceive of some government regulation that will benefit them at the expense of their competitors. But you can't just go around saying ""pass this regulation so that we can increase our profits at the expense of other people"". So what do they do? They find some way of spinning it such that the regulation is really for the ""public good' or for ""consumer protection"" or ""consumer safety"".

The brilliance of this strategy is they are able to convert extremely gullible but otherwise well intentioned people to their cause of fattening their profits. Average people start calling their congressman demanding this regulation. Rallies are held. Activists flood the communication channels with support ... All for the private benefit of special interest. 

This is how we got the Fed in the first place. The public was told this was a consumer protection measure meanwhile the President of the First National Bank of Chicago, James Forgan, was holding meetings where he tells the bankers, ""The purpose of this meeting is to discuss winning the banking community over to government control, directed by the bankers, for their own ends"" (actual quote).

We've seen the same thing play out in the Bitcoin community sadly, but I'd actually be surprised if it worked long term in this case because, unlike regulation, the blocksize isn't mandatory.

"**Psychological projection**

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

"> Blockstream plans to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users off chain

Segwit was a block size increase (2.3MB in practice, potential max of 4MB). So, uh, you were wrong.

Also,  [the scaling roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) contains an additional block size increase. Just not till after other scaling solutions are tested and implemented. So again, wrong.

And blockstream does not control bitcoin development just because they employ a couple of the [90+ active contributors](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0.1). That's just conspiracy theory nonsense. Development and the decisions made are decentralized, like they should be, unlike 2x which is just one guy as far as I can tell.

"Well I've been to India. The infrastructure is up to handling bigger blocks. It's behind, but it's not 1980's behind. It's the same story in many countries the US would call 'third world'. There is no need for every user to run a full node in any case. A modem from the 1980's would be perfectly capable of handling millions of dollars a day in transactions if there is a SPV client at the end, and there would be no increased chance of that client losing funds because of it.

Stenography is not relevant to bitcoin. It's not a reasonable way to transfer a constant stream of data and it can be detected by entropy checking lower order bits.

> Please respond to my argument of small blocks in the context of censorship resistance.

A larger block size makes no difference to censorship resistance except by enhancing it. You seem to be implying a 64MB chunk of data would be somehow easier to censor than a 1MB block but that's just not true. Both sizes are absolutely tiny compared to all the cat videos, email, and web traffic going over the internet. You should understand that any kind of data can be tunnelled over any kind of channel. 64MB of data every ten minutes can easily be sent by DSL, cable modem, long range wifi, mobile networks including those installed in third world countries, or pretty much any kind of network it's possible to build with modern equipment.

The only way small blocks affect censorship is by causing the self-censorship of everyone that gets priced out of the whole system by higher transaction fees. If you charge more than the banks do you have already priced out everyone except those that can't use banks.

"> Without LN it will be, with LN it may not be. It seems like you still think I am against LNs.

So we agree that LN increases the block space available for everybody, great.

> Segwit allows a blockweight of 4 megs. That is 4 megabytes that needs to be stored and transmitted. 

Older clients that don't understand segwit only need 1MB of that.

> 
So what is in the extra 2.3 megabytes? It is bloat. This bloat can be used for things like confidential transactions, but it cannot be used to store more transactions. Did you not know about this?

">  they cannot tax you for using it 

And there, you'd be wrong.

*Given that this is true, it is easy to discern methods by which software developers can begin to extract revenue from the system: second layer systems such as Lightning Network propose to lock potentially large amounts of economic activity and liquidity outside of the blockchain in favor of non-PoW settlement systems which then rely on the PoW security to prevent counterfeiting. There is also an opportunity for potentially large amounts of block space to be “leased” by the developers: In such a scenario the developer produces a software which allows them to prioritize certain transaction channels for a contracted buyer, this allows the software provider to consume space in the block for a discounted rate and pocket the difference. In this process the miners are continually starved of fees, an increasingly unstable scenario as block rewards continue to decrease over time.*

*This will inevitably lead to miner’s margins being squeezed to the point of directly increasing centralization as only the most competitive miners will be able to derive any profit. This can quickly turn into a losing scenario and in the ongoing hashrate drop you find an opportunity to simply layer all of the secondary solutions over a low-security blockchain such as a proprietary algorithm operating on a central service whereby the computational security is trusted not by the highest difficulty chain, but simply the chain “owned” by the provider which may now be truncated, editable, and considered to be private property.*

*For reference: If the software provider is charging as much as possible for block space, and paying the miner as little as possible, eventually profitability for both will reach an artificial equilibrium. With users forced to access the blockchain via the software provider, the space available in blocks and the fee costs associated can be adjusted at will, ensuring minimum fees for the miner and no variability in competition. Compare this to an open fee market where supply and demand are forced to intersect organically and overwhelming demand for block space will drive up miner profitability insisting that the equilibrium of supply (cheap transactions) and demand (fees/block) be a moving target.*

"My only suggestion, keep reading both, and make up your own mind. 

You'll get a lot of conspiracy theories, but digging deep enough, more than one big blocker (fan of r-btc) realized which of the two subs is the really toxic one. For one, keep reading this sub and you'll soon find out 90%+ of all the posts are all about 

* How shitty BTC is now because *not Satoshi vision*, with tons of links to the white paper

* Core = Blockstream (Hint: It's not, not by far)

* Supporting any coin that could damage BTC - First it was Bitcoin Cash, now it's S2X, and eventually it'll be something else; 

* A mis-guided belief that miners are all that matter in the ecosystem... because ""white paper"" (Hint: Miners mean very little. It's not immediately clear why, but once you get it, it'll be like seeing through the matrix. Also, miners know it.)

* A broken understanding of the role of *full nodes* (Hint: No, they don't ""slow down the network"", as Roger Ver would have you believe... they in fact keep miners and everyone else honest. Also why miners have very little power.)

* An unhealthy degree of conspiracies

* Blindsided adoration of the big block preachers (Roger Ver, Craig NotSatoshi Wright, ...)

* ...

Then there's the remaining <10% of posts which actually discuss how to improve Bitcoin Cash.

Overall, you'll notice that this sub does not give you much in terms of a postive/cheerful experience. It's mainly a lot of negativity.


&nbsp;

You can probably tell I'm not a fan of this sub, so you'll see my post downvoted into oblivion. I don't care. But you keep reading both subs, and give it some time before you ""pick your side"". Ask questions on both subs, and engage your critical thinking. I'm fairly positive I'll see you on r/bitcoin. Not only you'll get to understand how bitcoin works much better, it'll also bring many more smiles and laughs. :)

There's nothing wrong with providing a service for a fee. Setting up a custom sidechain or altcoin is a service. Also, this hardly harms Bitcoin. A few funding/settlement transactions on-chain, everything else hidden in a sidechain. Fine with me.

Don't get me wrong. It's not okay to cripple the Bitcoin chain. It's not okay to force soft-fork hacks onto the users. It's not okay to stall scaling and development. It's not okay to harass users and miners.

"   G-Max has also [talked about this on BCT early last year.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/435vcw/what_is_blockstream_selling_feebased_private/) Blockstream are somewhat open about it in other venues, but when pressed on this issue in /r/btc they are extremely vague or completely silent on how they plan to actually turn a profit. The reason that /u/nullc and /u/adam3us constantly throw smoke screens in our face is because the [conflict of interest regarding their business plan](https://imgur.com/a/WMoUB) versus what is best for bitcoin is so incredibly huge.

   Speaking of deception, does anybody who isn't G-Max or Adam have any more information on exactly why and how Austin Hill left Blockstream? My understanding is that they were secretly using him for his VC connections only, and once the dipshits got in bed with Barry good, Hill was pressured to leave. Now that Barry told them he will no longer be leading or even participating in investment rounds, Blockstream turned to the East by bringing in Samson Mow who likely guaranteed them at least one more round of $50-75million. This is why they are currently on their [""world tour""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78g23a/blockstream_is_on_a_world_tour_anyone_know_what/) trying to scam some more fools.

"Nice written but parts of it is a non-problem. For instance, miners receive 12.5 BTC that is worth approximately 9 times the value of previous market value when the reward was 25 BTC. The network is VERY secure as it is, BTC network is eons from being unsecure therefore we do not need more hashing power at the time being, because that's what's it's all about in the end. If we make it more expensive to broadcast on-chain, more lucratively attracts more hashing power to the network which at this point is not needed, I would even suggest that we could cut of 50% of the hasingpower and the network would still be safe, so I don't see the point of the statement that ""it's unfairly cheap!"" Why would the great honest and superior miners suggest that we need more hashing power securing the network, we need to start from there before we make low (or even none) fees a problem that needs to be addressed!";1;0;False;Plutonergy;doxfwab;"""Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware"" source- Adam Back Blockstream CEO";78r8c6;https://i.redd.it/av045qkiw1uz.jpg
