"**Hanlon's razor**

Hanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways including ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."" It recommends a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for a phenomenon (a philosophical razor).

As an eponymous law, it may have been named after Robert J. Hanlon. There are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far as Goethe in 1774.

If you really believed in Bitcoin you would have already converted all your fiat to Bitcoin by now. See, it doesn't work like that. BCH is one effort to break out of Core's strangulatory grasp that may or may not succeed, but that doesn't mean someone who opposes Core shouldn't support it. That also doesn't mean you go all in right away. There is still a chance of a miracle for BTC, via a fork away from Core or Core somehow getting its act together, and if BCH fails we will just spin off again later. Core has to win every battle. We only have to win once. We have to keep powder dry for the long haul.;5;2;False;ForkiusMaximus;dqqa8uc;"Remember: Bitcoin Cash is solving a problem Core has failed to solve for 6 years.

"It doesn't need it, the point is that many kinds of experiments can be tried without crowding out and making impossible all the other ones.

Imagine Lightning works as Core thinks it will. It still costs 1 on-chain transaction to open a channel and 1 to close it.

Will that be cheaper on BTC or BCH?

BCH.

Lightning, if it works or not, will be better on BCH than on BTC, no matter what, simply because BCH works better as a cryptocurrency, works better because Core has hamstrung their own coin, on purpose btw, so they can earn fees off the lightning network. (And if Lightning doesn't end of working, Core is completely screwed.)

Sad that they would purposefully cripple bitcoin just to try to get rich, when this tech can improve the entire world if not hamstrung.

Running a full node is the only way you can be totally sure noone else is doing anything fishy. A full node will do full validation. We want people to participate in this validation, because it helps keeping everyone honest.

Now, the BCH narrative is that only miners need to run full nodes. But if so, then only miners are verifying themselves! I am not saying all miners is dishonest, but aren't our goal to make a trustless network, where you don't *have* to trust anyone?

Now, everyone is of course free to trust anyone they want, but the only way *you* can fully be self-dependent and verify as much as possible, is to run a full node. And full nodes will reject non-valid transactions. Don't we *want* non-valid transactions to be rejected?

"> But if it's unnecessary that means it is redundant.

Use cases can coexist without being redundant. There are a lot of kinds of transactions that should be on-chain, and why you want to retain cheap and abundant on-chain transactions.

And there are use-cases for Lightning as well, assuming it works as they claim it will.

Lightning is not a complete replacement for on-chain transactions. If it were, they wouldn't need anything on-chain at all and could dispense with bitcoin entirely and just sell the lightning network as the new payment system and who cares about bitcoin.

Maybe that's their intention long-term, who knows.

But Lightning introduces layers of trust and human intervention that do not exist on-chain. So Lightning is not a complete replacement and never can be. On-chain is trustless and permissionless, but lightning is not. Sometimes you don't care about trustless and permissionless, sometimes you do. Different use cases, not redundancy.

> You say it would work better for some things but don't provide any examples. 

E.g.: the obvious ones, buying your daily coffee or any kind of repeat corporate payment; settlement between banks, between credit card companies, etc. All the ""in system"" stuff, that is, Lightning is probably going to turn into a great way for the legacy financial system to integrate with cryptocurrency in some fashion.

> I think you just are saying what you wish is true, or trying to make bch sound better than it really is.

It's not a claim that BCH has cheaper transaction costs and more capacity than BTC, that's here and now. Those same things are a plus with Lightning too.

Lightning requires an on-chain transaction to open or close a Lightning channel. The 3rd world person can afford to spend a penny or less to do this using BCH with an on-chain BCH transaction.

They cannot afford to do this now with $5 transaction fees on BTC and with Core wanting fees to go ever higher.

It's pretty straightfoward.

The only theoretical question here in all of this is whether Lightning will end up working as they claim it ultimately will. A lot of us do not think it will. But the worst is that if it does, BCH is still a better venue for Lightning to run on top of than BTC is, because the property of the BCH chain are superior, both in cost and capacity.

You are trying to do with a comparatively shitty computer what miners are doing with warehouses full of processors. Part of the bitcoin concept is that you don't need to trust anyone as the mechanism for settlement and transaction are currently protected by $750,000 per hour of computing power.

"The core problem is that Bitcoin discussions are inherently highly technical and mostly subjective. For true discussion you need a person who is: a) great developer b) master cryptographer c) has substantial experience with crypto currency development d) is objective

Just a) & b) eliminates like 99% of people from being able hold productive discussion on Bitcoin... and then you get FUD like ""24 terabytes to support Visa network's peak capacity"". c) & d) are tricky when you get to that 1%... because if developer has experience with something, it's hard for him to be objective. You see that with current Core Dev team.

Long term it'll keep being information conflict - trying to spread ""the truth"" and reach some kind of consensus. The only thing that comes to my mind is to maybe build some kind of FAQ and point people to it when certain topic comes up. Like you don't need to guess what block size is needed for Visa network's peak capacity... simply watch this video in which /u/Peter__R and /u/thezerg1 explain details regarding scaling:

https://youtu.be/5SJm2ep3X_M?t=3m10s

There you can see that current codebase can't scale beyond 100 tx/s ... meaning that ~33MB blocks are MAX. With changes /u/thezerg1 made to codebase (multi-threaded queues and intelligent locking) you can get to approx 500 tx/s (which give you 165MB blocks). All this tells you that from codebase pov we are still far away from giga blocks.

As for Visa level capacity - Peter Rizun was talking about 4 billion people x 1 txn per day ~ 50000 txn / second. That brings needed block size to 16.5 GB.

Now - I doubt many people will put effort to even read this condensed version I've typed... let alone do their own research. Or get into scenarios that do not align with their subjective view... like how Bitcoin doesn't really need to support peak capacities, as transactions can stay in memory pool... average txn count and it's trend is much more important than one time peaks.

TLDR: Point people toward places where uncensored, productive discussion happened that answers their Qs. FAQ would help.

EDIT: Ho Lee Fuk... only now read that [piece by Coinbase CEO](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)... didn't know he was that pissed at Core Devs back in 2016.

"I hope u/memorydealers sees this as something constructive.

You have to accept that Roger as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" - that's a powerful image and moniker... He has been featured in some bitcoin movies and plays a very very very important psychological role. Now, I really see him as a visionary of sorts, but the video tarnished any logical, practical and technical debates. 

Will non-technical people remember the saliency of 1 MB blocks vs bigger blocks? Maybe. 

Will non-technical people understand Segwit, Lightning network, others and why they are bad? No, most people will see the outburst. In the same way that teens used to focus on Justin Bieber (rather than his music), in the same way that people used to focus on the Kardashians, you get my point? 

You're right, bitcoin cash is a worthy cause. But Roger overshadowed it. His personality somehow, through some lens, became synonymous with bitcoin cash 's identity? Could that perception be changed? Yes, and no.

It becomes a matter of statistics. Say 70% will see the video, and the core announcements/propaganda (as you will), they'll focus on that. 

Who was that investor who had 3 qualificatory questions for a startup? Anyway... 

First question almost always is, **""who's behind the project?""**

Not everything is logical. While Bitcoin cash is or could be the ""real bitcoin"", you cannot help people asking, ""Bitcoin cash's main proponent is Roger Ver"". He did what? Lemme see the video. Oh no. 

I would respectfully suggest him hiring somebody who would handle his social media presence, refrain from responding to troll-baits on social media, focus on delivering a message rather than attacking the other camp, focus on delivering the product. 

Just 15 to 20 years ago, people didn't care about Microsoft CEO's Steve Ballmer's antics. The critics and haters loved it, but the Microsoft team just worked on the product. There's XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10.... What made Microsoft what it is, is that they cared about how the product Microsoft Windows could make people's lives better. We really should focus on how bitcoin cash could do that.

If **Bitcoin Cash** really is true to its promises - **the product has to speak for itself.** The product has to speak for itself. It's the product and the message. 

In my country, the Philippines, the most convenient way to acquire bitcoins (BTC) is only through 1 or 2 websites. Both transact in BTC. I tried sending 500 pesos worth to a friend, in BTC. The fees ranged from 350 to 400. The fee is more than 50% the amount I tried sending. Now, we need bitcoin cash if we really want to create an impact with bitcoin, how do we go about this? How do we, third world people acquire bitcoin cash without having to acquire bitcoin (BTC)??? 

Solve that, focus on the product, focus on the message - everything else will follow.

"The whole point of Bitcoin is triple entry accounting. Triple entry accounting is what makes widespread adoption of Bitcoin a threat to people who make their money by taking advantage of the corruption our current double entry financial system allows.  

Segregating the signatures from a transaction removes garuanteed triple entry accounting for that transaction.

Allowing transactions to be processed off chain removes triple entry accounting. 

The high transaction fees and crippled network through-put are simply being used as a way to force BTC transactions onto a settlement layer, thus removing triple entry accounting and thus turning BTC into fiat.

The only thing that makes Bitcoin valuable is triple entry accounting.  That is the only significant thing distinguishing Bitcoin from fiat.

"> Cheering btc while spitting on alts lile nobody is working on their tech beside btc dev? I also support btc but still recognize tech like ETH or NEO.

I am a strong supporter of Bitcoin BTC. I do not spit on Alts, instead, I prefer to make a case of why Bitcoin BTC will regain market share from Alts again.

With new scaling solutions on the way, more privacy, etc, some Alt Coins will no longer be needed, and others will drop in value.

I do not personally like Ethereum, because so many scam ICOs have been launched on the Ethereum platform. I think that Vitalik will face major legal problems in the future, because these were launched on his platform.

NEO, I do not understand why it has value, as it was launched as being similar to Ethereum, but for the Chinese Market, which has banned all ICOs!

"I respect /u/MemoryDealers - but I also understand why a lot of people don't like him. His passion often puts him in positions where he spreads himself thin. Mt. Gox video is a great example of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0

It should be noted that he later issued an apology video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIJ_jpmwzo

But of course, look at comments on the video and see how many people accepted Roger's apology. I personally do understand Roger (easy for me since I lost $0 on Mt Gox). If anyone should be villainized there - it's Mark Kerpeles.

The long term problem is that Roger seems to repeat this mistake often. Like that recent debate with John Carvalho - I still ponder wtf was that about. John obviously trolled with ""BCash, BCash, BCash"" and yet Roger flipped out because his arguing for decency of discussion went nowhere. Worse yet, Roger switched to ""I'm millionaire, so I'm smarter than you"" route while in parallel acting completely childish. Of course, when everything was done - Roger issues another apology video.

So all-in-all - I really wish /u/MemoryDealers focused more on his strong suits and harnessed his passion in productive ways. He is obviously genius-level investor... even people who hate him don't deny that part. But he definitely needs to do away with childish parts of his characters and taking cheap shots... long term that kind of stuff hurt him way more than people he was aiming at.

He runs a subreddit called r/btc and yet when I look at coinmarketdesk, btc refers to one coin and this sub seems to support a different one and oppose btc. I held before the split, still hold all my bch and I for one think both chains have people doing excellent work. But the existence of this sub seems very duplicitous to me. Bch seems to be an excellent product. Why then should this sub not be named r/bch or r/bitcoincash?  This advertising method reeks of low self esteem. Social engineering is supposed to be the opposite of what crypto is about. Crypto is about privacy and independence. I separate Ver from bitcoin cash. I believe bch is excellent. At the same time I think the marketing of it by some of its advocates is really sketchy. I think he should change the name of this sub if his reputation is his first concern.

"I could only give it a quick glance, sorry.  It seems that he makes a highly simplified mathematical model of mining, in a highly unrealistic scenario (two miners), and concludes that the two cannot drop down to one.

I don't see how one can apply that conclusion to actual bitcoin mining. 

Suppose that he removed all references to bitcoin, mining, and resources, and just described an hypothetical abstract game of two players with those mathematical rules.  I suspect that the proofs and discussions would remain just as correct and consistent.  If that is the case, I would say that the paper is just a result (or maybe a simple exercise) in abstract game theory, with no relevance to bitcoin.

In reality, the forces that push mining towards concentration include the lower costs (hence higher profits) that come from economies of scale, better deals with suppliers and utilities, greater leverage with local governments, wider choice of locations, etc..  It seems to me that these forces will continue to exist down to the two-miner endgame -- and may be even stronger then.

"Ignoring the paper entirely, and thinking only about the real situation:

+ Ostensibly, it is unlikely that the number of pools will drop to less than 3.  If there are only 2, one will occasionally have more than 50% of the hashpower, and then the public reaction that happened in the GHash.io might happen again, forcing that pool to split.

+ On the other hand, nothing really prevents the same people from owning or controlling pools that comprise a majority of the hashpower; or the forging of secret agreements or cartels with such power.

+ If there are only two independent groups owning most of the hashpower,  it is in their interest to make an agreement to reduce their hashpower while preserving their proportions.  

    For example, APool has 40 EH/s, BPool has 60 EH/s.  APool and BPool could agree to cut their hashpower by 50%, keeping their relative market share.  That is equivalent to them merging into one pool and splitting the revenue 40:60.   After the difficulty readjusts, their revenue (in BTC) would be the same, but their costs would drop 50%, so their profit would increase, maybe even more than 50%.

    The lower difficulty could attract other entrepreneurs to set up pools.  However, unless these new pools are quite large, the cartel could drive them out by reactivating their dormant hashpower for a while.   (They could also simply orphan all the newcomer's blocks, but that would be inelegant and might soil their image...)";2;0;False;jstolfi;dqq5247;I found the abstract for Adam Back's forthcoming paper on Blockstream Tabs.;7hau2e;https://i.imgur.com/yrR6N4v.png
"> This could mean 100

The correctness of the bitcoin protocol depends on mining being distributed over a very large number of **independent** anonymous miners.  That assumption is required to make the key assumption plausible: that a majority of the miners (counted by hashpower) will care only to maximize their chance of winning the next block's reward and fees.  

100 independent miners is already too few for a network with 1000 users; definitely so for a network with 1'000'000 users.

20 *presumably* independent pools are totally too few, for any number of users.  If the top 4 pools (all Chinese) formed a cartel, they would have a majority of the hashpower.  The top 6-7 Chinese pools would have about 2/3.  That is not a decentralized system anymore.  I am quite sure that, if Satoshi looked at [this chart](https://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=4days), he would immediately conclude that the experiment failed and the bitcoin protocol does not, after all, solve the problem it was meant to solve.

(Before you say it: the individual miners do not get to see the contents of the blocks, and don't know what mining software the pool is running.  Most of them  do not care about ideology and politics, they care only about the pool's payout and other technical details that affect their profit.  If the pool decides to implement a soft fork, they will not notice and probably will not care.  If some pools form a majority cartel and decide to use their power for some plan other than selfish greedy mining, that plan is almost certain to also benefit their mining members; so actual miners are more likely to migrate *to* the cartel pools than away from them.)

> if you compare all of his writings to BTC and BCH you will see that he does not describe BTC + 2nd and 3rd layers + LN + smart contracts. He clearly states that the block size will increase as there is greater demand.

Yes.  But he also does not describe the non-mining relays that were inserted between miners and clients after he left, and which thoroughly break the protocol's key concept and security arguments.  

And he also assumes that traffic would grow much less than 50% per year.  Which has in fact been mostly true, apart from the lump increases due to drug traffic, mixing, and gambling.

The top 4 miners can do that now.  They could announce to everybody that the min fee will henceforth be a flat rate equivalent to (say) 0.10 USD/kB, plus 0.2% of the total output value minus obvious return change.  

That would be a soft fork, so a simple majority of the mining power can force it on everybody, with no voting or debate -- including on the other miners, because their blocks will be considered invalid by the majority if they contain transactions that pay less than the new mandatory fee.  

Any pool that fails to enforce that new fee policy will see his blocks ignored by both the majority miners and by all clients and services, and will have no revenue.  Its member miners would  immediately flee to pools that enforce the fee.

The majority cartel could even enforce the new min fee immediately, without telling anyone.

"> This argument has been made again and again and it assumes that the said ""mining cartel"" is going to slash its own throat to forge a chain that pays less than mining said chain.

And this response has been offered again and again, equally based on an unproved assumption: that there is no change that the cartel could impose that would make more money for them in the long run than sticking to greedy mining on the current chain.

If six  known fixed mining companies was fine, Satoshi would have said so.  But then there would be no need for PoW and all the rest.   His solution was only worth looking at -- only deserved to be called a ""solution""  -- because the *essential* hypothesis of thousands of independent anonymous miners seemed plausible at the time.  

> You only need enough decentralization to avoid censorship.

Bitcoin now is useful only for illegal payments, and only because they don't care for ""decentralization"", only for ""lawlessness"": the willingness to process payments without regard for KYC/AML and without possibility of seizure/blocking by law enforcement.  That is what is euphemistically called ""censorship resistance"" by those who love bitcoin only because it provides such service.  

But while lawlessness is almost a necessary consequence of decentralization, the latter is not necessary for the former.   If it were, then bitcoin would not be used by that population, because it is obviously not decentralized.  Fact is, they do not care at all whether there are 10'000 miners, or just 6, or just one.  All they care is that the miners will process their transactions, no matter what they are.

The totally centralized Liberty Reserve (LR) was totally fine for that market, until it was shut down.  In fact, it worked infinitely better than bitcoin.  They switched to bitcoin only because there was no replacement for LR available.  For them, bitcoin is just a ""LR 2.0"" -- slower, clunkier, more expensive,  less reliable than the original, but the only thing they have now.  They will switch again to a centralized LR 3.0 if that becomes available.
