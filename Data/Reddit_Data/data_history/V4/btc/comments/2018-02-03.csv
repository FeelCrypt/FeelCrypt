"Hey man. I have you set as a friend on Reddit and have you listed as someone smart and knowledgeable on EOS. So I can see you have some bias that would make you think like that. I see EOS and to ETH as ETH was to BTC, so I have the utmost respect for Vitalik and the ETH team, and I'm still invested in ETH as it's good to diversify.

I'm just disappointed that you hold these opinions, as you must be a smart guy. Maybe you're right and Vitalik is the best scam artist I've ever seen, but all I've ever seen from him is intellectual honesty and regular ol' honesty and politeness. Nobody is perfect, and according to my research, the resources you've provided seem to be mixed with non-arguments or very small nitpicky of where ETH/Vitalik got it wrong, but owned up to their mistakes.

A lot of those links are old and the issues have been fixed.

As for the DAO fiasco, I'm glad to have the debate, but I don't believe code can be the ultimate law when there is the possibility of unforseen consequences. After all, who would want to invest in something where all of their money can be gone because of an unforseen bug? I think there needs to be some permanent fix for this fundamental issue, but for now, ETH is in its early stages and I appreciate they forked. One investor said that's how he knew he made a sound investment. 

You could question what the rules should be for when to fork, but I think it's going back to the fundamental issue that rules cannot be hard and fast because any case can be completely different than the possible scenarios you've envisioned when creating the rules. This is why most judges rule based on the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law.

I envision the future of smart contracts to include a provision that states any party can opt for an agreed upon party / oracle (one person or most likely a group chosen by a system like Augur) to have the final say in settling the contract. Even if we're able to fix coding mistakes with proofs, being able to envision every edge case scenario for a rule / law is a bit further down the road.

Onto security: I'm not fully aware, but has there been a major security flaw in ETH's code? I'm not taking about dapps or third party code. Maybe you'd say ETH could have been coded better to prevent third party code from being vulnerable, but hindsight is 20/20, is there something you can point to that was really egregious / foolish?

As for centralization, it hasn't been a problem for any cryptocurrency yet, and if it happens, the community can and will fork to keep it decentralized. I feel like the bigger issue crypto solved was how to incentivize open source projects. As long as a project is open source, it can be picked up if a carrier falls down. 

 TBH, I skimmed the link that claimed to show ""no ""legitimate"" developer respects Vitalik, as a lot of them I know of as Bitcoin maximalists, or who I like to say belong to the cult of Bitcoin Core, which I know is a fallacy, but I don't want to waste my time either, so if you feel one is particularly insightful, feel free to link me to it. Also, saying ""no legitimate developer"" is like the no true Scotsman fallacy. Even some of those links had praise for Vitalik, such as Greg Maxwell saying he's kind and polite, but he felt he was naive (I feel like Vitalik proved him wrong in the end, but maybe you'd say ETH is still on course for a crash, I'm not going to argue), and the Cornell professor also saying he has respect for Vitalik. I mean, you also linked to a thread that said people don't respect the implementation of ETH, not Vitalik. The link to the Monero dev I found interesting, but /u/vbuterin responded with points that made sense to me here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/3wgcrz/the_ethereum_computer_securing_your_identity_and/cxwubpw/

/u/fluffyponyza made an excuse, and not saying his reason wasn't legitimate at that time, but unfortunately never replied, which I hate, because I feel like debate is the only way we can figure out tough questions. I just think many people don't know how to debate properly and end up talking in circles or past each other which makes it seem like no progress can be made.

I have an open mind about this, and I'm open to seeing your side, and I hope you feel the same.

I'm thoroughly against ""maximalists"" who treat any crypto as a religion where nothing about their favorite platform can be impugned. I've been researching enough that I know this space is way to complex to be arrogant enough to be sure of anything, so I'm always open to new ideas and criticisms,especially for the projects and people I like, which is why I find it disappointing that you have this tone and attitude like you're 100% right that Vitalik is a bad person.

I feel like if Vitalik, Dan, and /u/ethereumcharles (the leaders in the ""platform space"" imo) were to have a weekly discussion on Reddit, with community input on what questions should be asked going forward, the space would be a whole lot better and more progress would be made. What ends up happening is some form of debate is tried, there's a difference of opinion, and one person ends up leaving to try and prove their idea right. I guess it's an okay way to solve problems, but not an efficient one. If people had an open mind, they can all work together as a community and progress the field 1000x more quickly.

"First of all, nitpicking so much wastes my time and makes _you_ look stupid. When profit do you get out of it? This kind of behavior is just irrational.

Obviously, you know I was leading colored coins project that time. So what I'm saying about it is based on first-hand knowledge and can be considered evidence by itself (i.e. witness testimony, if you wish). Obviously, I can back it with more material evidence, but what's the point? Do you think I'm lying about it? What would be my motivation?

Adversarial thinking is cool and everything, but this is a borderline paranoia. You should consider visiting a psychiatrist.

Second, you wrote: ""If it were true [Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin], you'd be able to point to specifically public communication where you attempted any such thing.""

This is _non sequitur_. An attempt does not always produce a public communication. In fact, it typically doesn't. So if you want to play a ""nitpicking anal nerd"" game, you already lost it. Your logic is not sound.

Another problem with you is that you based your accusation on what a 3rd party wrote rather than what Vitalik wrote himself. This is a gross offense. Imagine I'd accuse you of being a liar based on what Roger Ver claims you said. How would you feel about it? This is a very shitty thing to do, don't you think so?

But anyway, we can actually prove that Vitalik isn't a liar. To do this, we need more precise definitions of ""attemted"" and ""any such thing"":

1. ""Attempted"". Obviously, a bad decision can be ruled out at a very early stage. So a sketch of a design and a consideration should suffice.
2. ""Any such thing"". Does it have to be a project called ""Ethereum""? Or should we threat it more openly, as design can change over time? This is up to an interpretation.

For example, I'd consider ""any such thing"" an attempt to implement functionality which is present in Ethereum but not present in Bitcoin, on top of Bitcoin (that is, using Bitcoin blockchain). This is a reasonable interpretation because obviously a project can get features over time, what shows an effort is initial significant feature.

And if we say that a ""decentralized exchange for user-defined tokens"" is such a feature (after all, that's basically how Ethereum is used now), then Vitalik definitely made such an attempt within colored coins project, for example. He wrote more than test script, as a former leader of colored coins project I can tell you that as an authority.

If you define it more tightly as a project with programmable contracts which can own assets and release them when a condition is met, he did that with his proposed Mastercoin extension.

Finally, looking at what Vitalik actually wrote:

> Not Bitcoin because the OP_RETURN wars were happening at the time and given what certain core developers were saying at the time, I was scared that protocol rules would change under me

The concerns about Bitcoin developers being unsupportive towards protocols built on top of Bitcoin blockchain are very well documented.  They were very well known and understood among people involved in colored coins project, as well as metacoins like Counterparty and Mastercoin. For example, I designed EPOBC protocol to avoid OP_RETURN because there was real concern that this feature will be disabled. Vitalik was definitely aware of all these issues as being a person in charge of writing colored coins specification, as well as consulting Mastercoin people, etc. So to any reasonable person it's clear that what he said is true.

As for what OP_RETURN has to do with Ethereum, any kind of a protocol can be built on top of Bitcoin blockchain by embedding its transaction data into Bitcoin transactions (e.g. with OP_RETURN) and thus obtaining consensus over ordering of such transactions. Ethereum functionality can be implemented as a metacoin.

Finally, we actually have a very interesting chat logs which pinpoints exact moment when Vitalik started considering Ethereum rather than ""Super Mastercoin"". Chat log was posted by Yanislav Georgiev Malahov [here](https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5). The relevant part (timestamps stripped for clarity):

     [17.11.13 01:05:01]
     Yanislav: if msc could encode itself in the bit coin block chain… that would be cool!!
     Yanislav: i mean: if algorithm changes are also embedded into the block chain… 
     vbuterins: okay, that would be cool
     vbuterins: although I would rather exploit an altcoin for that
     Yanislav: can we do this with the xpm block chain please?
     vbuterins: xpm maybe
     Yanislav: (y)
     Yanislav: let’s work together on this
     vbuterins: so, mastercoin on xpm with superadvanced features and source code updates in chain

So the idea which differentiates it from Super-Mastercoin is that the script code can implement the base protocol rather than just contracts which control assets. Yanislav proposed using Bitcoin blockchain for this and Vitalik considered it and said that an alt-coin would be better. Yanislav proposed Primecoin.

So we have direct evidence which 100% confirms what Vitalik wrote.

Is this enough for you, or are you going nitpick further, using obscure interpretations, playing dumb, etc?

"no he doesn't, Vitalik has more in common with other ~70% centrally premined bitconnect, bytecoin, onecoin, ripple and other projects that decided to [throw away decentralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/) as the very very first thing they do for personal profit. 

* vitalik has zero credibility in blochain tech outside of his censored subreddits, even his previous project was as much of a scam as ethereum - [quantum computer simulation to break sha 256](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/760gmb/lead_developer_of_ethereum_raised_money_by/). Wish I was kidding.

* satoshi didn't premine 70% of his coin, and create the most centralized project with only history of security failures

* vitalik [constantly](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/897846425593294853) takes credit for things he didn't invent and not citing, [eth has NEVER innovated](https://medium.com/@nextlevelcrypto/whats-the-story-with-smart-contracts-and-ethereum-c0d771fd9eb9).

* satoshi would never suggest using premined distribution for the horrific [Casper to make worlds most unsecure PoS](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7djclm/casper_masternode_pos_variant_to_use_70_premined/) 

* satoshi cared about security, vitalik has never once sounded like he cared about security. their rushed last minute updates, failed soft fork, chain splits from implementation chaos that satoshi specifically warned about, unsecure contract code that caused several global attacks on network itself, centralized bailout of his own investment, confiscating money bc 3rd party wrote bad code that even stated any code they write set the terms and conditions. I don't get how it gets more obvious than 0% centralized premine being altered to 70% centralized premine.

* [no legitimate altcoin developer outside of chain of liars and thieves respects vitalik on technical grounds](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7pe8ot/virtually_all_crypto_devs_and_experts_spoken_out/), for what seems like the same exact reasons people have against onecoin.

"LOL, really?

[Here's](https://github.com/killerstorm/BitcoinArmory/commit/9fd7764edaf64188f5bf81393fc28e8da9e07da2) Vitalik's commit to ArmoryX, which was [a decentralized exchange prototype](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/16w5vp/colored_bitcoins_armoryx_p2ptrade_gui_is_here/). I.e. it allowed to trade user-defined tokens for bitcoins.

Vitalik also made an attempt to write a colored coin specification, in fact he was doing it in parallel with his work on Ethereum AFAIK. [Here's doc he made](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit).

His work on Mastercoin extensions is probably less public. The only thing I remember is him mentioning that ""metacoin"" approach is superior to colored coins since it allows more complex functionality like smart contracts. (I think it was in a reddit comment so it should be possible to find it but let's not waste time on this, OK?) This implies he was considering implementing Ethereum-like smart contract functionality on a metacoin.

I'm not sure why you require work to be publicly visible. People typically do the most important part of the work in their head. Even if it goes beyond that, a lot of information stays in private repos, private mails, etc. For example, I described CoinJoin in August 2012, that is, 1 year before you did. But I described it in a private wiki which was lost. Would you call me a liar too?

But anyway, there's evidence of Vitalik's work on Mastercoin extensions. [Here's](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html) Vitalik's article describing Ethereum prehistory. From that you get to [Ultimate Scripting: A Platform for Generalized Financial Contracts on Mastercoin](https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html). 

You can see many similarities with Ethereum:

 * contracts escrow assets
 * contract is identified by txid
 * contract functionality
 * proposes use of 256-bit integers

NEVER store your coins on an exchange, insured or otherwise. The insurance would cover the fiat amount at the time of the loss, not the amount the coins may end up going up to. That's what Bitfinex did, and people lost an enormous percentage of their cryptocurrency, and they were out their money for a long time. Besides, it's beside the point anyway. It goes against the very nature of cryptocurrency, which is to be your _own_ bank. You should never tell people things that make them feel like it's ok to store on an exchange. And If they can't store their own keys responsibly themselves, then they shouldn't be in this to begin with.";6;1;False;;dtp03jd;[PSA] If your Bitcoin are not ready-to-transact in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control, then you don't control your Bitcoin;7uzz9t;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uzz9t/psa_if_your_bitcoin_are_not_readytotransact_in_a/

"It really depends on how paranoid you want to be with your coins. (Which probably depends on how many you have)

At a basic level you can just download Electrum/Electron Cash, encrypt your wallet with a password, back up your private key and/or recovery phrase, and send your coins to it and be good.

However, your private key could be leaked at the time of creation or anytime you input your password if your computer is compromised. So if you're dealing with a decent amount of money you'll want to take additional steps.

For dealing with the long term storage of no more than a few thousand dollars worth of btc/bch, this is what I'd recommend if you don't want to fork over cash for a separate computer or a hardware wallet (or reading other comments, you just can't get ahold of a hardware wallet yet):

1)Create a Linux live CD/usb, preferably with a Bitcoin wallet pre installed. I'd personally recommend Electrum/Electron Cash, but there are many suitable modern wallets. If using a USB, make sure that you don't have the option on that allows files to be stored in it's filesystem. You want a clean slate every time for maximum security.

2)Boot in to the CD/USB, and create a wallet. Back up the recovery phrase with a pen/paper (anything non internet connected is fine, a typewriter would be perfect if you have one lying around or you could even etch it into stone/metal). I'd also recommend including at least the name and version number of the wallet sofwate that you're using. Deposit a small amount of btc/bch at an address generated from this wallet.

3)Reboot the computer and boot into the live USB/CD again. Use your recovery phrase, and ensure that your small deposit shows up in your wallet. If so, you're golden! Testing your backup before you add significant funds is extremely important because any typo could result in a total loss of funds. Make (non-digital) copies of your wallet backup, and ideally you should test restoring from them too.

4)Find suitable physical locations to store your wallet backups. This is harder than it sounds, because while more is better, quality of location is also just as important. Anyone with access can completely wipe you of your bitcoins if they know what they're doing. This is essentially cash under the matress, except that losing security over even one of these can lose you everything. You also really want at least 2 completely different locations in case of fire or similar disasters.

Past that, I'd look into multisig wallets. This will greatly help with the physical security aspect of keeping your backup because now you don't have to trust any 1 individual or point if failure. If you make a 2 of 3 multisig bitcoin wallet for example, that means you need any 2 of the 3 keys to access your bitcoin. So with a 2 of 3 multisig wallet then you can keep 1 on your person/in a fire safe, 1 at your parents or close friend, and 1 in a bank safety deposit box. This is mildly inconvenient, but worth it because now you can't be robbed, your friend can't steal your Bitcoin, a rogue bank employee can't steal your Bitcoin, etc.

Keep in mind that you can always deposit to the address at your own convenience as you accumulate more coins, you only need to restore the wallet to actually send the coins somewhere.

I hope that helps, I'd be happy to give further advice if needed.";21;2;False;FracOMac;dtotg0j;[PSA] If your Bitcoin are not ready-to-transact in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control, then you don't control your Bitcoin;7uzz9t;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uzz9t/psa_if_your_bitcoin_are_not_readytotransact_in_a/

"*  Don't be TO paranoid. At some point you will have to trust SOMETHING or you can't live your life. 

* Use linux and keep your linux up to date. 

* Don't install linux programs unless they are from a trusted source and you know what you are doing. (if they need sudo you better make sure the program can be trusted!) 

* backup your seed on a piece of paper (maybe on two) 

* Keep your seed in a save place where nobody will look or if there are a lot of coins on it get yourself a real safe. If more then half of your savings are on this piece of paper better keep a copy of it at a separate place like a deposit box at a bank. 

* if there is no seed print of your encrypted wallet file and save the password to decrypt the wallet on a piece of paper. Don't ever rely only on your memory. If you don't use a password or passhrase for a  couple of years YOU WILL FORGET IT. 

* Don't forget that Bitcoin usually sends the chance (if you send less then a 100% of the balance on a address) to a change address. You better have this address backed up if it's not part of the seed!!!!! Lot's of people have lost coins because of this, don't let it happen to you! 


* [use the 3-2-1 backup rule](https://medium.com/meet-lima/the-3-2-1-backup-rule-d62b78f94238)



* Test you backups every month. A non tested backup is no backup. 

* Every couple of months move a tiny bit of your cold storage coins around just to check if everything is still working. The network also always changes a little bit, so keep up to date! (but don't get worried about every little detail and story, Satoshi knew what he was doing better then anybody else) 

* If you have coins in a wallet file or on an address that you cannot afford to loose then never expose the private keys to a computer system that is hooked up to the internet. This concept is called cold storage. You can sign transactions on offline machines (airgapped) and then manually copy them on to a online machine where you can broadcast to the network.

* When in doubt ask your questions here and learn how to recognize the trustworthy people on /r/btc 

* If you are holding a significantly sum in crypto then don't let anybody know how much crypto you are holding ... don't make yourself a target! 

* If you are using crypto exchanges make sure to enable 2FA over 2 separate devices (like laptop + phone) 

* Relax, 100% security is impossible but if you are willing to learn, even if you don't know computer to well it possible to  safely secure your own crypto.

Where the difference is that that's not the entirety of production. Rather, for example: healthcare, or school tuition, or basic income

Your definition doesn't seem particularly conventional, considering what socialism really is in countries with regular western socialized policies (in other words, not Venezuela, lol).

> All socialist nations to date have controlled and manipulated the money supply, and need to do so in order to manipulate and control markets and the population. Lenin specifically advocated for this, among others.

> The Scandinavian countries are NOT socialist. They are, relative to the rest of the world, very free market economies with a giant bloated welfare state they can barely continue to afford.

If we go according to your conventional socialism, then yes I fully agree. I'm not really sure how the discussion came to this though? Bernie Sanders is *definitely not* socialist by your conventional socialism, so where are we even going here?

> In general, they mean a system in which people say ""I want the government to control more of the economy and tell people I don't like what to do and where their money has to go"".

> That is precisely what Bernie Sanders supports. The man is no voluntaryist, minarchist or libertarian, obviously.

Yes, I agree. That doesn't mean bitcoin removes taxes entirely though, does it?

> But the corrupt banking system is an outgrowth of a corrupt state, not the other way around.

As it's clear Bernie Sanders understands too.

Why? What kind of socialists are you speaking of here?

Why does socialism have to have something to do with monetary policy for you?

No freedom? .... Let me ask my fellow Scandinavian friends how they feel their freedom compares to a country like the US.

"I'm no Trump fan, but the amount of support in this thread for Bernie Sanders and statist socialism in general does not bode well for Bitcoin.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to take the power of the printing press away from governments, and to limit their ability to inflate, regulate, censor and tax.

Of course, when you do this, you also destroy the corrupt cronyist system that is modern banking, which requires government support and bailouts to go on existing. And that's a good thing. But the corrupt banking system is an outgrowth of a corrupt state, not the other way around.

Seriously, if socialists think Bitcoin is a good idea, that's scary. They'd probably want to nationalize it and regulate it and subvert everything it's supposed to do.

"1. If you don't know who the earliest adopters and proponents of Bitclin were and what their reasoning was for supporting it, try Google sometime. It's this new website where you can look up commonly known information. 

2. Bitcoin by itself does not prevent taxation, no. But it cannot be seized by tax authorities in the same way more conventional assets can be, which was one of its key selling points.

3. Socialism, as conventionally defined, means a system in which the state (which is the organization that has a monopoly on the use of legitimized force within a society) owns the means of production (meaning businesses.) That is what I am referring to.

4. All socialist nations to date have controlled and manipulated the money supply, and need to do so in order to manipulate and control markets and the population. Lenin specifically advocated for this, among others.

5. The Scandinavian countries are NOT socialist. They are, relative to the rest of the world, very free market economies with a giant bloated welfare state they can barely continue to afford.

(And which they are finally starting to reduce in size because of how much of an impediment it has been since it began in the late 20th century, long after they created so much of their wealth through markets.)

They vary in their degree of market freedom, but like the US, they are effectively ""fascist"" in the economic sense. (Meaning a system of private ownership under state direction.) Many of them however, have freer markets than the US though, and all are among the freest markets in the world, currently.

(The world could do a lot better in regards to economic freedom, obviously.)

Anyway, theoretically, you could have a smaller voluntary socialist society within a larger libertarian society. But 99% of the time, that is not what anyone--supporters or detractors--mean by ""socialism"". 

In general, they mean a system in which people say ""I want the government to control more of the economy and tell people I don't like what to do and where their money has to go"".

None of those make any sense, you're talking out your ass. I can see a non government controlled bitcoin in a socialist style environment. The government doesn't have to control everything for a socialist.

Yeah, a quick mention of them in order to lay that at rest and get more votes. At no point did he give any details or talk about their corruption.
