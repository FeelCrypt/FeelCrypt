"Anyone who thinks we need to be diplomatic with Blockstream/Core doesn't understand the ""intransigent minority"", read Nassim Taleb: [https://medium.com/incerto/the\-most\-intolerant\-wins\-the\-dictatorship\-of\-the\-small\-minority\-3f1f83ce4e15#.sxt5mlel4](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.sxt5mlel4)

The vast majority of people will continue using BTC even though its capacity is deliberately crippled by Blockstream, and they will not know the reason why this was done. The Core intransigent minority will maintain this ridiculous limit. Only when BCH gains more adoption, value, and confidence will it usurp this order.

"That's why our voice is important. Only other voices I can prove in my post I am a real human being with a history. I am a lover and fan of Bitcoin. I was part of the group of people that made it a success. That talked about it with everybody. That told everybody in 2011 to buy it because it was going to go BIG. Those that listened profitten hugely. 

Nothing has changed. We forked to save Bitcoin, not to destroy or attack it. Our enemies are hypocrites and cowards, they gave Bitcoin a bad rap and made it look like Bitcoin can't work because of one stupid line of code that says: maximum 400 000 tx a day.

Then they use that line as an excuse to say: look bitcoin can only do 400 000 tx  a day, we need an off chain scaling solution because bitcoin has reached the maximum it can do!

"Don't you think that language like ""BTC was hacked by blockstream"" is overly polarizing? I've been in Bitcoin forever, and I really think that there's far too much vitriol \- from both sides. For example, the position that Bitcoin should have larger blocks and keep transaction on\-chain is reasonable, even if you don't agree. Likewise, the position that a hard fork to achieve that is too risky for such a large, distributed system is also reasonable, and the opposing opinions as to what extent being able to run a full, non\-mining node is important are also both defensible. 

What I'm getting at is that you don't need to tie in a blockstream conspiracy to explain Core's position, and, in my opinion, to do so makes you seem a bit crazy to your target audience (crypto noobs with limited exposure).

"> What I'm getting at is that you don't need to tie in a blockstream conspiracy to explain Core's position, and, in my opinion, to do so makes you seem a bit crazy to your target audience (crypto noobs with limited exposure). Likewise, the constant ""bcash"" bashing by BTC maximalists isn't a good look, either.

I disagree.  As I've stated before, you can't win by always backpedaling, and only playing defense. You can only win by playing offense.  Bullies prey on those who don't fight back.  I play offense.  Go for the jugular, go for the killshot, punch the bully in the face.  Play to win.

While the public leaders of the BCH community might want to be civil politicians, the rest of us need to be the SuperPAC attack ads, and win the fight in the trenches.

- When I post about Blockstream & Bitcoin BTC, I [document & source all my claims](https://www.yours.org/content/how-bitcoin-btc-was-hijacked--and-why-bitcoin-cash-was-created-24c7314b8b8f).

- When the Core trolls rant & drool ""[Bcash / Btrash](https://i.redd.it/ysx8w88gowe01.jpg)"", they're just posting gibberish.

As a result, I am basically planting flags.  Every exchange - like the above - means that I own that piece of internet real estate forever.  

Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, any neutral visitor will see one side ranting gibberish, and the other side documenting & sourcing all their claims.  I view every exchange like that as a piece of artwork that I leave behind.
