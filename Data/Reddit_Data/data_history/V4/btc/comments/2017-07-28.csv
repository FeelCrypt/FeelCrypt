"> They're more worried about food and education.

Yeah with their gov printing shitty cash, even more shitty then ""bitcoin cash"" - they have like 10000% inflation a year, no wonder their economy can't pick up.

If they would use a solid deflation money like [real] Bitcoin, this one problem is solved for them.";-1;0;False;metalzip;dktgc4t;If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.;6peqwr;https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement
"You provided a link which I read. I understand that some people technically may not like certain aspects of it, but nothing in there that I saw in the body of that article, technically justifies the rather strident conclusion with which it ended. It *seems* to raise some valid concerns, but the overplayed conclusion leaves me skeptical rather than convinced.

Have you read http://segwit.org, especially the FAQ ? They directly address many of the false claims I've seen bandied about. How about https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/ ? I don't have to relist the benefits here, because the project is already so well documented.

As for my technical ability and ""engineering mind set,"" I am in software engineering, and I went into the code to see whether I could find anything to justify all the FUD I'm hearing about SegWit2X (from both sides). Although I haven't done a deep analysis (I was looking for my personal interest), I can't see what the big fear is all about. The rearranging of data in the block reminds me of some common similar approaches I've seen and used when a project has to deal with the constraints of keeping backward compatibility intact.

Similarly, I don't see any reason to be afraid of a 2X bump in base block size.

So this is why I'm on board for both parts of Segwit2X.";1;0;False;scientastics;dktwjiz;If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.;6peqwr;https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement
Miners are not bad people and r-pi are for kids.  Virtually no kid in Africa wants to run a node. They're more worried about food and education.

"> which is basically taking the power to settle on layer 1 from the ordinary person.

No, it is taking power to sattle from **miners** and giving it to anyone.

Mining node - like 10,000 $ for any serious operation

Lighting Node - children in Africa can run it on r-pi for 80$
