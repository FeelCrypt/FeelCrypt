"Let me explain something very important to you, that most BCH people get completely wrong:
- in this pic, you say it must be used as a medium of exchange before becoming a store of value
This might be a bit harsh to understand, but historically its always been the other way around. Why would anyone want to exchange something that does not inherently have/store value? 
The way this has always worked is following:
- I like this thing i could use it as a medium of exchange!! Great...
- said thing must prove itself
- it proves itself by becoming a store-of-value, once this thing has become more popular, and trsuted for its value
- it can become a currency! that is transacted and used on a daily basis. 

The store of value MUST come first. If not, well then the trade simply will fail over time because, who is going to want to trade something that does have have a proven capacity to store value?";1;3;False;Geofinance;dx5enmf;Hodl vs. spedn;8b8ex2;https://i.redd.it/u3x8nz0763r01.jpg

I said previously that I have no problem with the forking or including bitcoin in the name. This part makes perfect sense. It's the after this part that gets really bad and shady and not just ethically but probably legally if it comes down to it and certainly financially for everyone involved. If this wasn't money and It was just a piece of -free- software then who would really care (actually people would still care but certainly from a lessor extent). I am hodling both as well but the bch tactics seem so shady to me that I find it disappointing for not just btc and bch but for the entire crypto community that I find it weakens the entire community over the greed of it and will likely shake out potentially adoption of new users over the confusion. As far as using as actual spending crypto cash - I actually prefer LTC which has a larger real world adoption than bch by far and overall similar cost and functionality and has been around much much longer. ;1;1;False;jojlo;dx3h9h9;CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey makes a $2.5 million investment in the Lightning Network, just a few weeks before stealing the @bitcoin Twitter handle;8arp51;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/

"ltc's fee are something like a penny (maybe 1.5 cents?) and bch around half a penny so I would say both are already negligible.  Who is really complaining because if a 2 cent transaction? Seriously!  :)  
  
I would say the same argument for short blocktimes... they are mostly negligible and there is definitely a case to not make it too quick.  I don't have an opinion on what the right time should be but it should be a  balance of various factors. I don't need it to be seconds to be functional as currency but sure if eth can successfully do it at 15 seconds and still be good for miners and the backend than it is superior in that point but in a minor way imo.  
  
I would say from your perspective... Both LTC and BCH are clones of btc but LTC had the balls to change the name and build from scratch and the foresight to do it long ago. It doesn't have to be complex to be good. It serves it's purpose and in business terms the simpler is almost always the better. Ask apple about simplicity... 
Is bch more complex? Is the complexity worth the cost of being complex? not sure... 
  
I missed the boat on eth and wasnt paying attention to crypto when eth came into being... Just hodling. The concept of it is excellent imo and I hope gets somewhere because of it. I think the money case for crytpo is just the first use case and eth opens the door for other possibilities and ideas and I'm curious how blockchain concept will evolve in the future. I like the idea of making use of all the miners for real world problem solving instead of just balancing a ledger and wasting all the other energy.  I guess I'm fairly pro eth in concept but I'm currently not a holder of it. It may be the facebook to bitcoins myspace. It certainly has a long way to go though in terms of the public's consciousness of it though.

"Canonical transaction ordering (mid term) will lead to graphene block propagation (long term), and the bitcoin network can easily sustain the new 32mb blocks.  I just downloaded multiple gigabytes in minutes on my shitty internet (compared to the rest of the world).

1mb blocks are artificially limiting, but ultimately 32mb will sustain mid-term until UTXO database improvements are made (also in-flight for bitcoin cash) among other ideas.  Bitcoin/Blockstream created a ""problem"" to sell a ""solution"" (lightning network) and it is a poor design choice tech/UX wise in my opinion, bitcoin cash will just always function as bitcoin always did, in comparison.  Except it will be 32x more efficient power-wise because of how proof of work, works.

That makes it superior to me, because I've used bitcoin for 8 years, mined it for 8 years, and I want it to scale naturally as designed, not artificially limited with a segregated witness and payment channels that lock funds up.  Bitcoin cash has heavy hitters like Gavin Andresen (an original bitcoin dev) at the wheel helping, as one small example.

"again, it's a strawman to try to make it tech versus politics (I'll call greed). They are both factors.  
I disagree with BCH being superior on a tech level (how so?) and I disagree with LTC not having engineering behind it. Just recent topics of innovating especially right now with litepay and lightning network and integration with btc. How is BCH innovating? It's trying to copy a model from 8 years ago. Maybe I'm missing something.  
  
I didn't realize how big litecoin was until I saw this link:
https://coinatmradar.com/  
They simply aren't even comparable period. LTC is far superior. I was surprised when I first saw it myself. It's also notable that just about every bch location also/already has ltc in the same location but not in reverse. It is valid to say that bch is getting wider adoption though but it's still from being near LTC in real world adoption. This point is worth revisiting over time. 

It seems to me that every pro bch talking point fails just under basic scrutiny compared to LTC. Ive asked this before in this sub about comparing bch and ltc and it tends to just show the same flame/meme points over an over but I never can get a solid answer to how BCH is superior to LTC with exception to one thing... it has bitcoin in the name which is really a marketing (or as you would say political) point.  It has validity compared to other alts only because it created it's value through the btc fork and btc already has a monster crypto world footprint which means bch also has that same userbase/ledger crypto world (not real world) footprint. It made money from thin air and successfully in this regard - even if way less value than actual btc.  
  
the main conversation points tend to be: They tend to be similar to equal in most ways of the tech. The real world usage is vastly superior towards LTC. Bch has the name bitcoin (and bitcoins original ledger) going for it tend to be the real primary pros and cons of each. Basically bch just has bitcoins history as it's primary pro factors which I find crazy and ironic.  
  
I'm curious how lightpay and lightning network integration will affect things in the future but I don't think it can hurt anything unless it introduces too much complexity for the end user. These topics are also worth revisiting over time.

"End of the day I'm a blockchain engineer, and bitcoin cash is the superior option right now for me on a technology level.  It's the same reason I use Linux (and thankful that every blockchain I use runs on linux equally.) I also use Linux heavily for work and income, does that somehow drive my political usage and promotion of it?  No.

Bitcoin cash just wants to be the bitcoin we were all using 8 years ago and beyond.  I have a bunch of litecoin too but I do not believe it has the same amount of engineering power behind it, not even 10%.  I also don't think it has any more adoption than BCH has managed to get in a short amount of time.

"I've bought and sold and mined for 8 years, lots of profit sure but ultimately I went through my BTC transactions from 2016 and the sat/byte and total fees were super low.

BCH fees are lower than litecoins, even though litecoin is trying to push the fees down, BCH is doing even more to drop fees below 1 sat/byte.

I honestly feel like dumping my BTC stock if it hits 19k again (if ever) but I hold onto all my old keys for sentimental value.  I even dumped my BCH initially in august because I thought it might just be a fluke, then I re-bought back the same amount around $300 after reviewing all the individual dev teams behind it.

LTC is just a bitcoin clone with shorter block times and scrypt, it is nothing special.  I only still own mine because of the name and charlie lee's undeserved hyped, the code does nothing else that I know of or can find.

And, if you want to say LTC, say ethereum, it has similar fees and *fifteen* second block times, not 150 second blocktimes like LTC.  That's because ethereum is infinitely better engineered than LTC ultimately for transactions, there is no UTXO database at all and the GHOST protocol was implemented to handle uncles for quick transactions.

"CLee has said that he will enlarge the blocksize if truly needed but its not anywhere that point in the near forecast. This is not an LTC limitation or factor. Your points are pro bch compared to btc but not LTC as far as I can tell.  I kind of agree that the negative of enlarging blocks can be very detrimental to the internet itself just in terms of the added bandwidth straining the entire infrastructure of the actual net to maintain parity across all nodes across the entire planet... In realtime no less. Ive seen the math and it isn't pretty although I haven't done the calculations myself to validate. Just because your one machine can do it quickly doesn't mean the entire internet can do it quickly if pushed to that point and maintain that bandwidth. Do you think comcast is going to allow it's network to be crushed because a crypto coin just wants to maintain parity amongst every miner on the net sending 32 megs to every minor in the world every few minutes? it's going to cause huge real world problems for everyone if this becomes an issue.   I do somewhat agree that BTC on the other hand should probably slightly enlarge the blocksize. Actually, I would think this would be an adjusting variable as needed but maybe that's asking too much. (it shouldn't be)  I do personally think that this specifically was done as a way of BTC to profit for all the nodes and miners and hurts itself as a means of being a currency crypto. This, I believe, is single handidly the diverging point of btc versus bch. It's profit motivating the back end infrastructure and hurting the point of being a currency in one -business decision. This is where I agree with you on the original vision of bitcoin but I respect that the devs made a decision to profit their back end and convert the idea of btc to be more of a storage of value. I respect bch forking to maintain the original vision. I dont see this as a pro compared to LTC which always maintains this vision and option to enlarge if actually needed and I prefer them keeping it smaller as long as possible. LTC has always been meant is a means of currency (LTC silver to BTC gold was the original slogan) so it has been faithful to it's original intent and to satoshis original vision. Again, I don't see bch being superior to ltc here.  LTC already has more capability in the current size to be bigger than the credit card network of visa an a real world example. Lightening network probably helps btc more in terms of tech but helps LTC more in the sense of getting a larger userbase/usercase. It's not fundamental for it's use as a crypto. It's an additional benefit or a perk. I'll research your other points as I am not knowledgeable to comment but they all seem to be future tech and not currently in place. Certainly proof of work is probably the smarter decision for all coins but will be a sad day for minors. Maybe that research will change my perspective but I don't see BCH being superior to LTC either in concept or tech which was my original question and unless I'm missing something hasn't been answered here.

I have not used the lightning network. I have transacted both BTC and LTC and have some BCH stored from the split. All transactions have always been great across the board in my experience. I will likely in the future use BTC as storage and LTC for transactions as currently intended so I have no plans to use lightening network at this point unless to do it just to test it out.   
  
All points aside, if you've been mining for 8 years, I assume you are very well off at this point so congrats on that. i unfortunately mined then stopped but still did pretty decent all things considered but in hindsight, of course I should have kept at it.

I have probably put in 20 hours code reviewing the lightning network daemon, the primary repo, and the golang code is commented well but the design seems awful to me personally.  As a 20 year software engineer, LN seems like a harsh sell compared to on-chain scaling.

"it was a good conversation and I'll thank you as well. I use whattomine and I use nicehash but I constantly hear people say there is better knowledge/info/numbers elsewhere but I never hear where. I recently started mining again around the beginning of the year but these days it seems to not be a profitable decision or barely profitable at best. 
having said that is why I stopped years ago though ;)  
I only do gpu mining and mostly with amd cards which unfortunately they havent provided a stable -and- superior driver so it's fairly finicky and unreliable which adds to the pain factor. I may migrate slightly more to the nividia side. I also do archviz (and had done IT and heavy scripting in the past) so I may make a renderfarm out of the cards as well.  
  
I don't know enough on how eth works technically beyond the basic concept to understand most of your comment so I'll have to do more research on that topic as well but good for you as crypto clearly is a growing industry so you are likely very well positioned for the future.  
  
As far as the block times, I don't necessarily think that super short block times are going to separate one alt from another. It's not enough to just be technically superior in business. There is also a media and public presence as well that goes hand in hand as well as an ease of use/enjoy-ability of the product for the end user/consumer that are all primary factors for any product in which alts ultimately are... Products like coke and pepsi. 

Everybody who got into crypto in the last 6 months is taking a dive but if you got in prior to that like you and I then it should still all be mostly gravy even with todays current numbers.

except bch tries to maximize it's use of the word bitcoin and minimize it for btc and in many unscrupulous ways. when you think about it, why didn't it just start a new coin like LTC using the same software? The brand value is what bch really has as it's primary motivator/selling point that it cloned from btc. By cloning the ledger allows it to be bigger than if it just started fresh. It's real selling point is that it has a presence already created from btc and I grant that is was successful in that endeavor.  ;1;1;False;jojlo;dx50q4b;CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey makes a $2.5 million investment in the Lightning Network, just a few weeks before stealing the @bitcoin Twitter handle;8arp51;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/
">call the original - ""bcore"" 

Nobody actually does this except in the context of counter-trolling the trolls who use the term bcash

>or just core 

Bitcoin Core is the only relevant client on the BTC blockchain. ALL protocol and consensus decisions are made by Core developers. Development of BTC is completely centralized under Core. Thus BTC and Core are synonymous even if they choose to brand themselves as Bitcoin and refuse to acknowledge other forks. 

>that they are trying to steal the brand.

Can't steal something that has no owner. 

>Just by using the same ledger, they are trying to steal and convert the user base. 

Bitcoin Core is also a fork that uses the same ledger. Nobody stole users. Users are free to choose sides. It's this mentality that users and the brand are property of Core that motivates people to abandon Core. 

>When whomever originally had the twitter handle only had it to disparage bitcoin as an attempt to upsell bch 

He's had the handle since 2011. It doesn't belong to Core. If he has decided that Cash is the better fork, that's his right.

>it should be revoked and it should be transferred to the correct bitcoin. 

You're advocating censorship?

>It's the same as when someone bought a web domain of an already existing company because they were first to profit off of it in the early days of the web but now there is a process to get the web domain to the rightful company or owner.

Again, the current owner of @bitcoin has been the owner since 2011. Nothing has been purchased. Nothing has changed ownership. What you are advocating is the forced seizure of private property.

>It's the same with twitter handles of famous people that now celebrities have to get a verified tag to point out that it is who it's intended to be and not a fake attempting to masquerade with a fake name to troll or impersonate. 

This is bullshit. The account is not and never was verified. It doesn't need to be as that is a decision only the account owner can make. 

Just because you disagree with the opinion of @bitcoin doesn't mean you have a right to silence him.

"Bitcoin core is not a fork. It has always maintained it's own path. It didn't change direction or codebase. BCH forked and split into a different direction. It is an offshoot of btc.  
  
Obviously btc is synonymous with the coin... named bitcoin so yes every owner of btc is being slighted when bch tries to steal the brand bitcoin and confuse the market on what is the original and actual bitcoin. This is marketing 101. Every owner of btc is being slighted when someone uses the bitcoin twitter handle and pretends to be someone part of btc but really is trying to tarnish the product. This is why no real company can claim the name ""coke different"" or ""coke blue"" or whatever. BCH tries to minimize using the word bitcoin when referring to btc and maximize the word when referencing bch. To be clear, I don't mind both sharing the name but it should be seperate and clear to the market. I do mind the confusion in the marketplace purposely and deceptively. I don't mind the copying of the ledger. It's a smart move to make money out of this air if successful but be clear that it is now and forever more a different, distinct and separate product. Ethereum doesn't have this problem because both sides are clear on what they are and that's how it should work. 
  
""You're advocating censorship?""
I'm advocating truth and honesty not ""fake news."" There is a difference. There is a reason websites get taken away when they don't belong to the real world business. Being first to take the website name or twitter or any social media doesn't mean it was first to use the name in the real world. It's deceptive to take the name and pretend to be the real bitcoin currency and disparage it for the benefit of an alt coin. You already can't do it with a website, you can't do it in social media or anywhere else without being opened to to legal liability. It doesn't matter how long the user owned the name. The name existed prior to the person acquiring the handle. Bitcoin was around long before the user took the name on twitter. He only acquired it on twitter because it already existed in the real world. He didn't just spontaneously make up the name. It has whats called ""prior art"" in the real world. I --am-- advocating seizure so the rightful owners of the twitter handle get the name that should belong and does belong to them. According to your words, since it wasn't purchased, the person the handle was seized from deserves no money as compensation for him having the handle and then it getting seized. His ""property"" has no financial worth to him and he paid nothing for it. That user is free to get a handle of something like ""ilovebch"",""ihatebtc"" or whatever and fairly and honestly cry his heart out to the world on how bad btc really is. He does not have the right to masquerade as a real world product or devs or whatever and hide behind the anonymity of the internet to troll the product his is pretending to be. It's analogous to you going in public and saying your a cop to intimidate people. That's bs and illegal in the real world but the world hasnt quite caught up with crypto since it's a new industry yet the law is grey for now but won't be for long.";1;1;False;jojlo;dx5aqgy;CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey makes a $2.5 million investment in the Lightning Network, just a few weeks before stealing the @bitcoin Twitter handle;8arp51;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/

It was offered as a condition upon increasing the blocksize later, the BTC chain will regret reneging on the Segwit2x deal, because the miners will not back a blocksize increase.

Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core are competing forks. That much is true. But you can't be a fork and NOT retain the ledger. That's the very definition of a fork. And although BTC has managed to retain the branding, it in now way resembles Bitcoin as it was prior to the Segwit fork.;1;1;False;ergofobe;dx5032u;CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey makes a $2.5 million investment in the Lightning Network, just a few weeks before stealing the @bitcoin Twitter handle;8arp51;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/lightning-labs-just-raised-millions-from-jack-dorsey-and-others-to-supercharge-blockchain-transactions/
"> It was offered as a condition upon increasing the blocksize later

Or it was a ultimatum by the USAF community.

> the BTC chain will regret reneging on the Segwit2x deal

I guess you're unaware of the horrible bug that segwit2x had, it would have literally stopped Bitcoin at a specific blockheight when it activated. I don't think anyone regrets dodging that bullet.

> because the miners will not back a blocksize increase.

Lol. They did, they do everywhere else, and they will. Besides, they don't control the consensus rules, they control the order of transactions.

> BCH will eat its lunch at that scale.

BCH will be lucky if it can stay ahead of Litecoin.

"First off, I want to thank you for having a great discussion, you seem to care about things (obviously we are both biased on financial investment side of things but that's normal).

I didn't ""miss the boat"" per se on ethereum, I still bought in at a late point from $180-320, though with current crypto prices it still seems horrible overall on everything, BTC, LTC, ETH, all performing horribly just like BCH.

Ultimately I'm a smart contract developer, so I write solidity code on the ethereum blockchain and it's really pretty amazing.  It does things even BCH won't do with the op-codes re-enabled this year... so I still won't use BCH for development purposes.  I also paid for some ETH at a price near $1000 earlier this year at a premium, because ultimately I plan on using it to cover contract gas costs.

If you want to see insane block times, look at EOS, they supposedly are moving to 0.5 second block times.  I'm not sure what those guys are doing but I'm keeping my eye on them as a potential development platform too (I don't own any though.)

As for mining, I mostly moved to ethereum after selling my bitcoin ASICs and switched to GPUs again, and I would recommend this site to tell you what to mine, when, and with what: http://whattomine.com/
