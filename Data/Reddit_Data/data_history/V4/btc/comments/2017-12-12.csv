" Bitfury created two (2) individual transactions across a total of 3 payment channels on main net. This is not ""creating the lightning network"" without segwit, it's showing that payment channels are possible today, which was already common knowledge, and that with the right software, at least a single hop tx in the right circumstances is also possible. Also from the article:

>it seems increasingly likely that SegWit could be live within a month. This would allow for a version of the Lightning Network that offers an improved user experience....“The Lightning Network will be the most effective when used with SegWit.""

No one is disputing the availability of payment channels, the challenge is trustless, multi-hop routing; malleability is a problem for that trustless part without very specific circumstances.

Also, a few people having an on-the-spot laugh about the general nature of software delays on stage is of course evidence of *nothing*, as I'm sure you know. 

Of course, that definitely doesn't mean you're wrong either, and if LN really doesn't materialize in even a rudimentary working form on main net over the next twelve months I'd admit to betting on the wrong horse. But the [rapid growth](https://explorer.acinq.co/#/) in the testate version, both in terms of nodes and channels has been encouraging to me so far.

No I don't. I think on-chain has to compete with off-chain and vice versa.

Its simple economics. On-chain competes with off-chain. The one that offers the best customer experience in terms of price, security, convenience etc wins. I actually think neither will ""win"" but that they will co-exist.

You have fell hard for the propaganda censored narrative.  LN does not work well.  I have read the whitepaper and delved deep into the slides on the Lightning Network website and I have complete understanding how it works.  It does not provide Tor like anonymity or security.  Its not as cheap as you think, you still have to open and close channels.  There are still many risks with LN and money can be lost.  People are just parroting talking points about LN and they have no idea how it works.

">When you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.

Not sure I see why that follows, or how you're using the meaning of ""risk"". Reliability and capacity are not the same thing; are you talking about the risk of the network going down from some kind of attack, which BTC has proven very resilient against, or the economic risk that high fees lead to users migrating to lower cost options? The base layer of BTC is built to be very dumb, very limited in functionality (and by extension capacity) in order to place complete emphasis on reliability and security, which has been successful so far in my estimation, if maybe a little too conservative.

>What user autonomy are you referring to?

What I'm referring to is my concern that with BCH, low fees will be great, attract many users for everything from buying coffee to microtx tipping to larger purchases, which will look great for a while as tx volume grows until we start to see average block size in the 10+MB range and node monthly bandwidth get into the hundreds of GB Up/down. This will lead to most of the nodes, like the one I run on a laptop at home to have to drop out as full nodes and switch to complete reliance on SPV, further increasing burden on nodes until only miners and a few very large BTC businesses are running them. From there, I've effectively had to give up my autonomy on which consensus ruleset my wallet and all the coins I hold has to follow. 

Just those few entities will end up controlling both mining power AND validation power. Down the line when block subsidy drops low from halving and fees are kept ultra low with unlimited block capacity, miner/validators will just decide to raise the 21M cap. Slowly at first, sure, but arbitrarily if they choose, along with any other rule changes/selective censorship that benefit them, and there will be nothing to stop them because there will be no option to boycott their network and continue on with our own, because there won't BE one that isn't theirs, we'll just be following along.

That's more or less the root of the small-blocker argument as I understand it. A smaller, more expensive network that retains all the properties that make bitcoin valuable to individuals is better than a cheap network that everyone could join that gets captured and tilted to benefit those running it.";1;1;False;Karma9000;dr49p5t;You have $100 worth of BTC.

You are your own bank, you make your choices, and everyone (*including* the banks) is welcome to build their own services on top.

"If that ever happens, my biggest advice to you is to take a deep breath and relax. Joe Rogan's podcast is a long form interview. You won't have to quickly squeeze in high energy sound bites or continually repeat yourself. You'll have lots of time to talk.

I know that constantly being attacked by trolls can put you on edge, but Joe's a good guy trying to seek knowledge. It's not about you or him, but the big picture, and the largely untold story of how the private for-profit company Blockstream hijacked the protocol. Study up and bring lots of specific facts to the table.

"good job Roger  u/MemoryDealers

some points for u to ponder on

1) by using the label bitcoin CORE , the public can find it rather misleading, first core means essence , do u really want to give that kind of inference to the untutored public to imply the  ""ESSENCE OF BITCOIN"" ?

2) calling them LEGACY has a certain elegance, they got a wonderful legacy from Gavin, and we got a wonder legacy from Satoshi, as the public are well aware , legacies can be squandered or put to use for the greater good

3) i know u'r attached to the bitcoin blank brand that u know and love so well, but trying to re-appropriate that is counter productive now . By calling ourselves bitcoin p2pcash or bitcoin BCH or other such snazzy title shows how we're different, we are peer to  peer , we are bch, we are cash , we are pop = popular .....
unlike legacy 's s2s sidechain to sidechain

4) the genie is out of the pandora's box, and the bitcoin blank brand will no longer fit back in the box...
squabbling over a BATTERED ""bitcoin blank"" so confuses the public. 

5)  legacy's model will take fees AWAY FROM from the miners who are paid to make it secure.... that's why a 1 penny fee for all  sounds great , but if we say 1 penny  gets u into the 2nd or 3rd block, that gives us  a way to grow the fees / tips for the miners

 but the bewildered public can understand the SIMPLE CONTRAST 

 ...legacy redirecting fees away from miners = less secure blockchain

....p2pcash giving all fees to miners = more contribution to security

6) no one has a monopoly on bitcoin blank, we need to educate the public that the free market gives choice 
[bitcoin] legacy / BTC versus  [bitcoin] p2pcash / BCH just like pepsi [cola] versus  coke [acola]

7) when p2pcash / BCH reaches a critical mass then having r/btc is a hindrance, because the BCH  brand will be more popular / well-known  than BTC/ legacy and trying to re-appropriate the [by then ] meaningless bitcoin blank would be a VERITABLE HOOT.

"/r/btc is a scam, do not ever go there for any information. It is essentially a blockchain replica from 1st of August.

"I can give a tl;dr version for now.

Basically, Bitcoin arose out of a radically libertarian, cypher-punk space. It was meant to be a tool for establishing a sound money unfettered by banks and governments, which itself would be a tool for freeing people from their tyranny and establishing freer markets.

Since about 2013, when Core devs came on the scene, they've steadily and implacably changed the properties of Bitcoin to no longer allow such to occur. Instead they've coopted it into the status quo. Bitcoin, as BTC, has lost almost all of its revolutionary capability.

Bitcoin cash represents the effort to continue Bitcoin under the aegis of its original mission of freeing the financial world. Imagine a world where there is not only separation of church and state, but separation of *finances* and state. That's what the early adopter of Bitcoin like Ver et. al got excited by, and what prompted anyone to buy Bitcoin in the first place. 

Hopefully this should give you some idea of why the disagreements are strong. They're motivated by deep convictions and desires. It's not about some silly game of identity or tribalism. It's about the future of finance on a fundamental level.";0;1;False;SpiritofJames;dr5ejs1;I (Roger Ver) will be doing an AMA on Monday Dec 18th starting at 10AM EST on /r/BTC because /r/Bitcoin is completely censored.;7jax1o;https://i.redd.it/7w1gmusp0i301.png

"I get that concern. But Im not sure I agree in some magical egalitarian vision of crypto you might have. I think of it more as a meritocracy. Anyone can share ideas and I think that's maybe where there's some egalitarianism. But you could say upvotes and downvotes take away from egalitarianism. So I'm not sure I totally agree. 

 In theory tho anyone can ask anything, if it's a good question the upvote mechanism is still there. This just adds a bit of gamifying for Q and A style posts. As well as security on a post that is likely to be visited by the Corey's. Or alternatively if someone doesn't have a couple cents in their tippr maybe there's a way for someone else to tip on behalf of the Q. Or even someone could tip that user then that user could go back and edit their comment to provide a tip. 

Donations could go to a charity or fund or something. Might be a good way to monetize little events like these. Its almost like that website that lets you email famous people if you pay X amount. Realistically you could probably email them or tweet them without paying. You're just paying for the increased odds.

">Do you think Bitcoin will continue to be a good investment if it cannot be used for anything other than holding?

yes at least for a while because of all the speculative fervor

however with the recent lightning test on mainnet things are looking extremely bright for its use as a form of payment

all that being said, i do not believe crypto will ever ""dethrone"" fiat and become insanely valuable

let me say it to you straight up.  all this talk that roger spouts about ""bank the unbanked"" ""think of the africans"" ""change the world"" is complete bullshit.  all he cares about is fame and power.  since he is likely the largest holder of bcash in the world he stands to greatly benefit if the price shoots up.  do you really believe he is out there making payments and conducting commerce with bcash?  he is a SALESMAN by trait, did you not notice how in the interview when he ragequit he had 0 crypto on his own wallet.  every single person who shills a cryptos transactional nature is NOT mainly using the coin for commerce - they are hodling.  sure they may buy something small here and there, they may use the tip bot once in a while, but they are mainly hodling as a form of speculation.  the entire transactional appeal of cryptos is a farce designed to increase usage and therefore increase the price for hodlers and early adopters via metcalfs law.  

now as a thought experiment lets say that the world did actually adopt crypto as a transactional method (meaning they actually set up the infrastructure to actually accept crypto, so far the only vendor to do it is overstock.com, all the other vendors use 3rd party intermediaries which instantly convert to fiat defeating the entire purpose).  i would still back bitcoin over all others.  i know you are trapped in the rbtc echo chamber but the reality is that bitcoin has all the nerdiest smartest dudes working on it.  look at the main proponents of bcash - roger (the largest holder in the world gee i wonder why he would pump it, also a salesman and completely non-technical).  jihan (also non-technical, just like roger he is making a play for power/influence by supporting bcash).  craig (infamous charlatan and scam artist, has not contributed anything to the crypto scene).  if i go down the list of the people who support bitcoin it's literally a who's who of the smartest mother fuckers in the crypto space, maybe even the world.

"It was my understanding that a UTXO was a subset of addresses, of which when traced through the chain can be shown to have some value ""in"" them. (Ie ""unspent"")

Thus a UTXO is an address, but an address is not necessarily a UTXO.

If an address A has 1.0 of coin X, and spends 0.5 to address B, 0.4 to address C, and 0.1 as the miner fee, then address B is now a UTXO with a value of 0.5, and address C is now a UTXO with value 0.4, and address A is now ""spent"".

In the converse situation, if address C has 0.4 and B has 0.5, they can be two inputs to a new output, D, which would have 0.8 (while 0.1 is a miner fee).

Thus... if AA uses a vanity address which thousands of people send small amounts to, the value ""in"" this address is the summation of all inputs.

In the event AA spends from this vanity address, the vanity address is *the* UTXO, as all of the thousands of small amounts were already spent *to* this vanity address.

If I am mistaken, could you point me to a resource that illustrates my misunderstanding?

"I have no idea how Ethereum works. Can't comment.

I think you're still misunderstanding me.

I wish I had a whiteboard..  haha..

Ok.. say you just created a wallet. You ask your friend to send you $100 in BTC. You receive $100, but your friend is sad because they also spent $10 to send it to you. (And therefore is out $110).

So, now you have $100 in BTC, and some miner somewhere is $10 richer.

Now, you ask a different friend for $50, but give them a new address. They comply (wow, what nice friends!). They send you $50. But they are also sad, because they had to pay a $10 fee to send you $50.

So now you have two addresses, witch a total of $150.

And somewhere, another miner is $10 richer.

But now you decide these people aren't your friends.. because they are silly and like to spend $10 fees.

So, you find a new friend, and they ask you for $130. You comply (pay it forward, right?). So you send $130 to your new friend. You pay a $20 fee because you are sending from two addresses.

And somewhere, a miner is $20 richer.

And you have no money.

Now, rewind.. when you are about to ask tour second friend for $50, you mistakenly give them the same address you sent your first friend.

Your wallet again, has $150 (but only one address).

Now, you again find a new friend, and they ask you for $130. You comply (pay it forward, right?). So you send them $130. And pay a $10 fee. So your new friend has $130. And you paid a $10 fee.

Your new friend buggers off now.

Boo! You have no more friends..

But yay! You still have $10! Sweet!

Oh shitz. In order to spend it, you need to pay a $10 fee.

You have no money.

You have no friends..

"Yeah, it doesn't quite work like that. [Here is a good explanation of transactions and inputs and outputs.](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-transaction-really-works/)


If you have Address A that's received 1.0 BTC in a single transaction, that address has one utxo. If you send 0.4 BTC to Address B, you take that utxo and use it. Once you use it, it's not unspent(the U in UTXO) anymore, so you have to use the whole thing. Your transaction would take that UTXO as an input and the outputs would be 0.4 to address B and 0.5 back into your change address. Anything leftover, in this case 0.1, becomes a reward to the miner and that's how fees are paid.


Edit: reread and it wasn't very clear. This example tx is creating two UTXOs, one to B and one to your change address. If you've received two transactions, you can spend both UTXOs as two inputs to a single transaction. The more inputs you include, the bigger it makes the transaction.

"That's not correct.

If AA's address holds funds received from 100 different tx, then he has to pay fee for those 100 inputs to move the total sum. If he moves these funds with a single tx, then it's the next address which has one input and pays only ""1x fee"". 

As said above I had a mining contract where a miner sent me ca. 0.0002 BTC daily to a single address. My adress had accumulated over 500 inputs from these miner transactions, which made it ridicilously expensive to spend. I tried to swipe it all to a new address (so it would create only one input.) with a lower fee than recommended (recommended fee was more than the address held) and it got stuck. Even tx accelerators were asking for over $1000 to accelerate it.

"Yes, more inputs is more fees. But those fees are paid by the sender not the receiver. Anyone thinking of downvoting now, needs to read the rest:

From AA's perspective, if he does spend from his address, *his* address is the unspent transaction output, or ""input"". (He has a single reusable vanity address, and does not create a new address for each person donating to him)

It makes no difference from AA's perspective if 1 person sends him 1 BTC to his reusable vanity address, or 100 people send 0.01 BTC. His vanity address will have a value of 1BTC either way.

No, you're mistaken. An address is not a UTXO. An address has many UTXOs from all the transactions they've received. When you send a transaction, you take a collection of UTXOs and send them to multiple places. Each recipient now has an additional UTXO that they can include in future transactions.

Bitcoin is different from Ethereum. Ethereum doesn't have UTXOs, from what I understand. They have accounts and balances. When you send $0.01, it increases the recipient account's balance like you're describing.

That's not how bitcoin works mate. When you spend, the input part of the tx is all the UTXOs you're using to spend, and the output is the UTXOs you're creating to transfer the value. So if your ONE address has 100 UTXOs worth 1 cent, your transaction for 1 dollar will contain 100 UTXOs, so the tx size will be VERY large in terms of bytes.;4;1;False;xModulus;dr4jea9;Here is someone sending Andreas Antonopoulos a tip of $1.50.They ended up paying $13.46 in transaction fees.;7j7ain;https://twitter.com/WolfOfBigBlocks/status/940223153967681536
Yeah, receiving a large number of small transactions isn't a great idea because each transaction received is an individual UTXO. Your outgoing transaction then has to reference all the tiny UTXOs in the address which makes the transaction take up a lot more bytes and more bytes = more fees. It gets to a point where the cost in bytes of including a particular UTXO in your transaction is greater than the UTXO is worth.

Your first paragraph is correct. My address doesn't care how many UTXOs you used, there's only one input in my address now. BUT.

"Things are starting to become clear to me, I think... Here's my understanding on why my prior understanding was seriously flawed... Following my PRIOR understanding, the following could happen:

If you control Address A, and want to send to address B, and change to address C, that cryptographic signature of that transaction would be X.

Now.. say someone sent you more coin to address A.

If the owner of address B was malicious, they could just re-transmit the *SAME* transaction, and steal coin from address A, sending coin to address B and C.

Clearly, this would be a terrible design flaw... THUS.. it seems that the design is such that if new coins are sent to address A after the first transaction, address A now has *different UTXOs* associated to it. Thus, invalidating a re-broadcast of the first transaction.

I'm not seeing why a transaction would need to include historical data of prior transactions, rather than simply state the associated address those prior transactions relate to.

No problem. Generally it's good practice to create a new address for every new transaction you receive, maybe that's what you're thinking of. If you're creating a new address every time, each one will have a single UTXO that you can use as input to a transaction.


>I entirely get that you can't spend a portion, and all must be spent..  and this is why some transactions have accidentally had massive miner fees because the person making the transaction didn't realize any un-defined spending was automatically presumed to be a miner fee.


Yeah, nearly every wallet software calculates this for you and automatically creates the change address. Some of those had to be custom software or someone crafting a transaction manually.

Every Bitcoin transaction must reference every Bitcoin *transaction* that funds it. The address is used only for signing and thus it doesn't matter if addresses are reused or not.

If so, is that tip identifiable by an address?
Is the number if UTXOs equal to the number of ""tips"" of transaction chains?
Is an output identifiable as a destination address?
Is an input identifiable as a source address?
Does a transaction represent a list of inputs and a list of outputs? (Among other things like the hash ID)
Is the size (bytes) of a transaction dependent on the number of inputs and outputs (plus some effectively constant overhead)

>Is an output identifiable as a destination address?

Yeah, the tip of a chain of transactions is a pretty good analogy. Mostly all of that is correct. An input is not identified by an address, but rather a UTXO. Transaction outputs belong to an address, and an address can have many UTXOs. You can't just say you're spending X amount from Address Y. You have to specify which UTXOs to include in the transaction. To spend a UTXO, it requires a signature from the address that owns the UTXO.


This enables nodes on the network to keep just a ""pruned UTXO set"", which is essentially just a just of accounts and balances. The balances come from adding up all the UTXOs that belong to each unique address. When blocks come in, your UTXO set gets updated and you can delete most of the history. I don't think many nodes use this, but it's possible.

"I'm also on a quest to better understand the protocol, so I don't know either, but:

From my understanding you don't really send BTC to an address. You publish transactions that are unlockable with the recipient wallet's private key.

No the number of inputs into tx only matters to the sender. In a standard transaction you would receive the payment at your address as one output. The inputs are combined by their tx into a single output. That single output is then available by you to spend. But the important thing to recognize here is that coins aren’t kept in addresses per bitcoin protocol. Coins are kept in transactions. So an address could have one bitcoin at it, but that may be tied up in one one bitcoin transaction or in ten 0.1 bitcoin transactions. They spend that money by collecting the transactions. New transactions use old transactions as inputs on a protocol level, not address balances. ;2;1;False;DangerousGame9;dr4mazz;Here is someone sending Andreas Antonopoulos a tip of $1.50.They ended up paying $13.46 in transaction fees.;7j7ain;https://twitter.com/WolfOfBigBlocks/status/940223153967681536
"From a basic level, isn't a transaction effectively:

"What's funny is, the bigger the transaction the cheaper this is to do, because the size per output would make the transaction cheaper for each extra output.

AA's address is one address. If 100million people sent 1 Satoshi to that address, it would not create dust.


It *would* cost $1 Billion in fees to send it, but it would be spendable. Since it would *accumulate* in the one (reused) address.

Edit 3:
I'm starting to understand the down votes.
It seems that normally, a UTXO is associated with a single address. However, a UTXO is not actually an address. So, a single address can have multiple UTXOs associated to it. Thus, when multiple independent transactions are sent to a single address, the number of UTXOs *still* goes up.
Spending from this one address still utilizes the multiple UTXOs associated to that single address.

Hence, a 1 cent donation to AA's vanity address still creates an additional UTXO, which will count as an additional input upon spending.";-15;4;False;laskdfe;dr47coj;Here is someone sending Andreas Antonopoulos a tip of $1.50.They ended up paying $13.46 in transaction fees.;7j7ain;https://twitter.com/WolfOfBigBlocks/status/940223153967681536

"Unfortunately, that's not how Bitcoin works. Ethereum does work like that, afaik, but not Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions use the UTXO(unspent transaction output). When you send 15 transactions to one address, there's 15 UTXOs (not including the UTXOs for change back to the sender). If you want to include more UTXOs in your transaction, it costs more fees. It's as if it costs $5 per bill to spend cash. It's not worth it to spend $1 bills if a $5 item costs $25.

"If it ever works.

The more I learn about IOTA the less sense it makes. There isn't even any incentive structure to ensure every node actually bothers verifying transactions.

The game theory analysis I have seen are based on good vs bad actors. But lazy actors (free loaders) are actually a huge problem, because they appear to be good but provide cover to the bad. I haven't seen any mechanism in IOTA to prevent free loaders which is worrying.

Then there are all the other issues that people call FUD, but I still think are real worries.

"More like make them accidentally waste money if they don't pay attention to tx sizes / fees before sending and/or make it inconvenient to send if they do notice/know what to do.

The Bitcoin Core windows client makes it relatively simple to work around this so it wouldn't make my wallet useless if you did it but I guess my first step to fight it would be either:

* wait it out, if I thought TX fees would come back down (wait for fees to be near the 7 day low would be the least I'd wait).

* Send an TX out manually using all the small tips and not care if it confirms or not just to get my wallet back to a more convenient state

"Relying on Moore's Law is a fallacy.  Moore's law is already starting to fail in terms of transistors on a die, and it never applied to storage or networking in the first place.

Running a node with a 100GB blockchain isn't too expensive: but running a node with an 800GB blockchain is a lot more. And, most importantly, it isn't 8x more: server costs don't usually scale linearly, with high end servers and large bandwidth allocations costing a premium.
