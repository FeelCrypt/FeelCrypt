"Words are cheap. Actions matter. If you use a censored forum you implicitly are agreeing that it's not bad enough to use an alternative, especially when one like this place exists.

And to make matters worse, you never ever ever seen him or any other 'champion of free speech' in Blockstream attack Theymos or a mod directly. If they really don't like what's going on and think it's bad, why not say it to the guy's face?

Either they're cowards afraid of being banned by a child, or they're complicit and saying things to win political points without any real cost to them, which is *exactly what politicians caught with their pants down do*.

They don't financially benefit at all. Bitcoin Core devs, including those involved in Blockstream, are heavily invested in BTC, and Blockstream as a company is heavily dependent on growth in the Bitcoin userbase for growth in its market. Both the value in BTC and the size of the userbase will suffer with community strife and a heavily restricted block size.;1;0;False;aminok;czbynw2;This is a public call to Core to renounce Theymos' censorship of /r/bitcoin;42kmlw;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42kmlw/this_is_a_public_call_to_core_to_renounce_theymos/

">2:04 am gmaxwell phantomcircuit: **pedantically**, it would no longer be free software; and doing that would be imposing a huge analysis cost of anyone else using the software; not a good tradeoff.

How the fuck is this being ""strongly denounced"". He basically said that saying the code is no longer open source is just being ""pedantic"" and that the problem with doing this would be that it would have higher analysis costs. i.e. if the analysis costs would not be high would be a good idea.
