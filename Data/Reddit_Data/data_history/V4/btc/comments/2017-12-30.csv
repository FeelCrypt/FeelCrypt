It’s also worth remembering that Bitcoin Cash already has the block size increase and the lower transaction fees, so it’s entirely possible that it will render BTC useless.;1;1;False;tjmac;dryvt8j;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead;7mbote;https://imgur.com/Fo8rZQi
"Oh no, it's always been in development. The creator and lead developer is a great technical lead and focused on making the software. Marketing was never a priority. There aren't many places for crypto discussion. The only ones that I know of are 4chan, Reddit and Twitter. I don't use the latter.
Lately Raiblocks got popular in all of them (check solume.io).

My point about Bitcoin was that it's now too big to double in a week (I'm referring to 20k-40k, 10k-20k does not count because it already happened). In my opinion the upside of Bitcoin is low compared to the risks. Mainly because I don't believe in it anymore. Core did a horrible job with it, and now it's an old piece of tech that isn't even usable... Now its future is completely dependent on the LN, which I don't think will work as promised. Hence during this year I sold all my Bitcoins. I buy Bitcoin only if there are pairs I'm interested in that only have BTC as numeraire.

It could go to 50-100k or 0 and I wouldn't care. I want to focus on solid projects like XMR and XRB. And in the periods of bull markets I'm flipping shitcoins, which is fun and delivers very high returns.";1;0;False;yoyoyodayoyo;dry2pe5;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"Alright admittedly didn’t know that.  But why I has no one mentioned it until this most recent wave of noobs?  I don’t spend much time on Reddt, which is the only semi-public place I’ve seen where XRB discussion is prevalent.  Seems as if there has been 0 development for quite some time.

As far as talking about BTC - it literally doubled in a week, and will be $50,000+ next year.  So I wouldn’t count on the notion that it can’t happen again.";1;1;False;FICO08;drxkcye;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead;7mbote;https://imgur.com/Fo8rZQi

"That's just tweaking the constant, not improving the tech. Neither 8mb nor 32mb nor any reasonable block size will be able to handle 10K to 100K transaction per second.

You are right to say that bitcoin cash would be able to handle the current bitcoin volume of transaction just fine. But if BCH were to become the new bitcoin, it would hit another capacity limit just a few orders or magnitude about the current bitcoin capacity. Since adoption is increasing exponentially, we're taking a time line of a few months or years in the best estimate, BCH really isn't much more scalable that bitcoin. **It is, and remain, the same core technology**.

Wikipedia: The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger,[14][15] a web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.[16] Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver, and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger's first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com,[17] debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[16][18];0;0;False;1001bricks;dry8mih;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"Big business are centralized, the market is centralized. This is what most people know and are comfortable with. Most still don't get what ""cybermoney"" can do other than appreciate like a tulip bubble (see, for example, that incredibly ignorant article today by a veteran financial advisor in a veteran financial publication - Forbes). Ripple's business plan is different but smart; they appeal to the quasi-informed masses and can masquerade as a traditional third party processor or a disruptive cryptocurrency as needed depending on their client. They offer a comfortable solution and entry point for traditional businesses. Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency, it's more like a stock share, but it provides a service and has a centralized epicenter that won't dicker for 3 years over whether or not to have 1mb or 2. Big businesses like having someone to call when their transaction fees increase 1000%. I suspect there's room for Ripple in our new world economy that coexists with cryptocurrencies, doesn't exclude them, and may even *help* them by bridging the banking - crypto chasm. That, and BTC is a dead man walking. A broken toy whose market share is getting radically redistributed. Further, if Bitcoin BCH burns out like a tulip pyramid, which it's hell-bent on doing, other brands will appear more attractive, and Bitcoin Cash may, in fact, **not** want to associate itself so closely with the tainted bitcoin brand, and may actually *benefit* by branding itself as something like... Bcash. I know, but if people think of the DMV when they hear the word ""Bitcoin""... Lastly, other cryptos benefit from the ugly BTC - BCH battle. Ether, Ripple, Dash...

"Who says that 1mil XRP is worth 2mil USD... <- the market, the exchanges. 

Does that mean if I had 1 million USD of XRP and the current price on Coinbase was $2 and I wanted to sell .. would I get $2million USD -- possibly.. 

It depends on **liquidity**... or how many waiting **buy orders** there are at $2 price. 

If there are > $2 worth of banks/people wanting to but at $2 then .. yes I'd get $2 .. 
but if only $1million buy orders at $2 then $1million at $1.90 then I'd end up with an avg sell price of $1.95.. so my $2million of XRP is actually worth $1.95.

**Don't be confused with the mkt cap of crypto ccy...** 

**Removing $200BN Mkt Cap from Bitcoin only takes 3 things**

As an **extreme**.. if Bitcoin were to have a mass -ve troll campaign that spread FUD .. and no-one wanted to buy... or say the crypto algorithm got cracked.. 

Then the price could go from **$15000 to $1 with a single sell order** (if all persons with buy orders cancelled them) and my $1 buy orders are there...
So you could wipe off $200 BN of Mkt cap with:

a) A single $1 buy order

b) A mkt sell order for 1 bitcoin 

c) News of a reproducable crypto hack.... 

where did the money go???
Well that's another post :-) 

You are correct that during the 6 seconds of transmission of XRP, that the price could fluctuate.
However this is not very different from the current FX Spot market, which also can fluctuate in 6 seconds. (at least in time as adoption/liquidity increases)

The International Settlements scenario is somewhat dependent upon there being sufficient liquidity to keep the price of XRP near constant ... at some point in the future (or at least stable over 6 seconds time periods) -- with the fluctuations, being more FIAT ccy fluctuations than fluctuations due to the fundamentals of XRP. i.e. say the Fed Reserve interest rates move... this will cause a change in the exchange rate of the USD.. so the price of XRP will change.. 

Many advantages -- 

i) cheaper than the swift network. 

ii) faster the the swift network

iii) Less support intensive than the swift network

iv) Less counterparty risk of default whilst Bank As fiat CCY is in Bank Bs Nostro account.

I could see how this would be done but it could be done with any cryptocurrency, not just ripple. The value changing during the transaction would cause issues.

>What real world use? A few hundred bank branches in Japan?

Yeah, for a start. Those few hundred bank branches in Japan will handle transactions for a large part of Japan's 120 million + people.

This mass crypto adopting bank free utopia you speak of sounds nice, and if we make it there i'll buy you a fucking cappucino or whatever with some doge... but again with that point you answered your own point perfectly: Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms. In the mean time we live in the real world, with banks, and they will perform insane magnitudes larger amounts of transactions than this whole little crypto world will. Maybe in a few years things will be different, but there will probably still be banks, and I bet they will be using Ripple or something like it.

>Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee

Yeah dude. That's a fucking trillion dollar a year business. Hence, my entire point... and 30-60% is kinda a big deal to these banks.

"> The fact that all the consensus nodes are controlled by one entity and that nobody else can join in the fun is also a strong hint.

That's not even close to how it works...validation nodes are responsible for reaching a consensus and there are already 3rd party validation nodes operating in the wild...not only that but anyone can create a validation node.

No, the banks can utilize the liquidity added by the markets though. But if the banks only intend to use it for submitting IOUs then the amount of ripple required is minimal. Basically it is just as speculative as any other cryptocurrency, with the knowledge that banks using XRP makes it cheaper for them to perform transactions. So the more normal people that own XRP the more incentive banks have to purchase it from exchanges if either A) all the 1 billion released for the month was already purchased or B) The entire pool of coins is accounted for and release to the wild, so the only option is to purchase more from exchanges. Put pinning an accurate value on the worth of an XRP isn't any easier than calculating the true value of any crypto.;2;0;False;AtlaStar;dryv0ga;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"Truth is, they don't need to. If they wanted to use the XRP ledger and network for transferring only IOUs they could...but it requires more work to do so than using XRP as the intermediary...plus doing so is even cheaper than not doing it...so you have profit motive to use XRP.

The main thing that adds liquidity is the Rippled flag you can set on an account...the tech behind it is interesting and worth a read since I can't do it justice here. The other component is market makers trading it on an exchange and having others buy it in secondary markets and continue to trade it or find places where it can be used as a currency as more adopt its use.

As to the fundamental economics of it all...well that is hard to pin down...currently fiat transfers use nostro and vostro accounts which are literally money just sitting there for the purpose of settling fiat conversions. The intent is to allow that money, estimated to be around 27 trillion dollars worth globally, to enter back into the narrow money band along with ensuring that XRP transactions are able to settle quicker than the current method....and the fact that transactions settle quicker via the Ripple network makes it more liquid than those accounts and SWIFT transfers...hence why SWIFT is looking into blockchains for the purpose of liquidity making them a possible competitor with Ripple Labs if they don't simple adopt the use of the Rippled network. So placing a value on that is difficult imo, but I would say using market cap to determine any currencies worth as seems to be the norm right now is a piss poor method and ignores the fact that the intent of cryptos is to replace fiat currency...which cryptos only make up a very small percentage of currently meaning they all have a lot of room to grow if used as intended.";2;1;False;AtlaStar;dryumpv;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"To your first point: Ripple isn't the one that can freeze funds unless it was from a direct connection between them and an account. I know there is a lot of fear after hearing about the amount frozen due to a holder trying to liquidate the majority of their funds, but it was done to protect the holders from a massive price swing hence why the initial contract stated that the holder could only sell a certain amount every month...the individual violated that contract so they froze the account to prevent a ton of XRP being dumped on the market.

Your second point is valid, I am not 100% sure what that statement means in context. It could mean needing to remove anonymity, or it could just be talking about the protocols used to ensure a non-existent account doesn't place false transactions on the network. I will have to educate myself further on that matter.

The third part is really simple: Ya know how you pay miners transaction fees? The wallet reserve serves that purpose and that purpose alone. The thing is that validating nodes can fee vote to lower the XRP reserve amount at any time. But the intent was to prevent creating numerous accounts to congest the network and to prevent other attacks.

Trust me, I have been following the crypto scene since around 2010 at the latest...I understand the end goal. The thing is that the biggest issue with the old banking structure is mistrust. Making money transparent will get rid of a lot of that mistrust. Making the currency not controlled by any government will remove mistrust. That said, XRP isn't even close to banker controlled...and it is no more centralized than any other crypto where a few mining pools can completely take control of the blockchain if desired. So if you dislike XRP that is your choice...but cryptos aren't overthrowing banks anytime soon as evidenced by the fact everyone is using cryptocurrencies as a security rather than as currency...gonna take a few years minimum before that starts to really happen, and at that point what do you use to derive the value of the coin from?

Hey, that is fine. Everyone is allowed to make their own decisions and I am not going to berate you for wanting to hold onto the more purist reasons for backing cryptocurrencies. I just see XRP as being the first step towards achieving true decentralization, that can eventually be replaced by a more decentralized coin once all (or a majority of) broad money becomes liquid...but XRP I believe is going to have a head start if they are the only coin working with the financial institutions to solve the problem of illiquidity that exists in certain transaction types.;24;1;False;AtlaStar;dry19sc;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"Earlier this summer, I listened to a podcast with the Ripple CEO that was a couple years old. I wish I'd saved it, because I haven't been able to find it anywhere since.

Anyway, he talked about the amount of money that banks keep in overseas branches in various countries that just sit around not making interest and unable to do anything, because of something to do with helping international customers or transfers or something. I don't remember the specifics, but I do vividly remember that he said that banks keep something like $10 TRILLION just sitting around collecting dust because that's the only way they can move money quickly and efficiently across borders. And Ripple integration with their systems is a way to solve that.

It sounded extremely convincing at the time as a business model that was solving a very real problem, as OP said. I recommend reading up on the company before judging too harshly, because it sounded brilliant to me. 

That said, I'm not defending the price of XPR itself. The CEO did specifically say in the interview that banks are not obligated to use XRP even if they're working together on this international business type stuff. I don't know how/if that has changed at all, but the business application is wider than just helping a few Japanese banks move money. You have to think of it in much broader business terms. 

Also worth noting that banking is as slow as any industry to adopt any new technology, so the fact that Ripple has been around for several years means that their deals may start to actually take shape. A brand new crypto could come out with the exact same promises and better tech, but then not finalize a single contract for 5-6 years. 

Anyway, I'm just trying to clear up a few things based on what I heard him say on the podcast. You can knock XRP, but the company and it's solutions seems to be pretty on point, IMHO

((EDIT: adding that I just saw further down this thread that the amount of money just sitting around doing nothing is closer to $27 TRILLION. I knew it was an absolutely unbelievable number when I heard it. Not sure where that commenter got his source, but the rest of the comment was pretty detailed, so he may be correct. That's the scale of money this company could potentially help banks free up. One hell of a pie.))";11;2;False;fitzrhapsody;dry2gqq;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"This is part of the problem, everyone lumping all cross border payments together and using trillions to base their valuation assumptions on. There is a massive difference between xCurrent and xRapid.

Use JPMorgan as an example, unlikely to use xRapid to any great degree, may possibly use xCurrent. To the extent they do use xCurrent, XRP would be the cost of processing a message it doesn’t feature as a cross currency. If the cost of sending that message is greater than say Swift for example or alternatives, then they are less likely to use Ripple at all.

"This is my main issue with XRP token. There are only two stated use cases. 

The first is an anti-spamming measure, which would require accounts to hold 20 XRP. That's not enough to create significant demand.

The second stated case is as an intermediary asset to replace the US dollar, which is stable and liquid, whereas XRP is not. The intermediary asset could have been something like the Dai Coin, or even Tether if Tether were honest. 

But instead, we have XRP as an intermediary asset, which would (A) need to be inflated to provide $5 trillion in liquidity and (B) then stabilized somehow. Banks are risk-averse and have no incentive to do this.

"> Second, the amount they hold is frozen in an escrow contract

You realize what the word ""escrow"" means, right? Escrow is when something is held by a third party so two other parties can complete a transaction. If Ripple Labs is one party, who is the other? It sounds like that was just a word inserted to make the situation appear more palatable which is: they hold over 50% of the pre-mined currency supply, but only give themselves access to 1 billion of the units per month, then if they decide to follow through on their own promise, which isn't binding in any forcible way, they'll lock back up units they couldn't sell off for a profit in some other currency to be released to themselves again at a future date to try again.

Would that be a fair assessment?

>Third, you can't give yourself something you already own....but it is of no value if you don't do anything with it and is only money on paper

I agree. It makes no sense to control 100% of a currency supply if you're the only one that uses it! What gives currency, ANY currency, value if the fact that many others also value it. It does, in that situation, make sense to control as much of the currency supply as possible, if you're the one in control.

"> But the intent was to prevent creating numerous accounts to congest the network and to prevent other attacks. I can understand disliking it, but it serves a purpose.

No, it doesn't. Not in cryptocurrencies. You should be able to create as many accounts as you want. In Bitcoin there are 2^160 possible accounts. The universe will freeze before we consume them all. Creating accounts is not an attack vector, as obviously for an account to exist it needs to have money in it. Plus a transaction needs to be sent and payed for. So an attacker can only do so many. 

Convince me this requirement was not purposely added to undermine privacy, please.

"Thanks for writing that up man.

I see it as problematic at least that xrp fluctuates and thus the asset I receive as a bank always has a different value in the end than the one that was supposed to be sent to me.

You say this situation is not very different from the current FX spot market, but isn't that the whole reason parties decide to transact in USD so that always 1 USD = 1 USD. Even if you want Euro's, FX markets are closed on the weekend, giving you a somewhat stablepriceview to trade against.

I just don't see (I am an economy noob so maybe the bankers see something I don't) why I as a money handling party - let alone a big bank - would make myself vulnerable to something like xrp in light of the above.

EDIT: Thinking of this just now. Also as a bank I wouldn't want to hold xrp very long before sending it, because if I buy 1mil usd xrp now on the open market, I might be able to send that tomorrow to bank B as only 900k since the price has gone down. The same goes for the receiving bank. i would want to get out of xrp asap because right now I can still get 1 mil for it but maybe tomorrow I won't. Doesn;t this create an extra hassle of having to deal with some kind of exchange mechanism, party that would have to able and want to exchange those xrp to usd pretty much immediately, or give the bank an IOU for the same amount (but then hello to IOU's again).";1;0;False;Tyanuh;dryylg4;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

The people behind it are donating their coins to charities and otherwise reusing profits to expand the Ripple infrastructure. If you don't see how putting your coins in escrow for timed releases stabilizes the value of the currency then you're missing basic economics at work. Further, the fact they premined their coins and can make a profit is like arguing tax cuts for corporations means they won't reinvest in their corporation, product, or employees and will only HODL the gains for stock options. I suggest you look into Adam Smith and Keyne's economic theories in greater detail. Along with taking a basic psychology course.

"I very reluctantly purchased $100 worth of Ripple earlier today for my girlfriend on her instance, and placed it into a wallet that she downloaded to her mac.

This is my experience:

What a sad and dangerous joke ripple seems to be... there are only 2 wallets of any relevance... the first is written in javascript and is only available on github https://github.com/jatchili/minimalist-ripple-client (which has not been updated in over 3 years), the second is based on that same javascript version... which you download from toastwallet.com (which has only been online for a couple of months now... yikes!)

And what a joke that toastwallet was... first they ask you to create a pin... then they ask you to pick a password... then you are forced to pick a ""seed"" which is only 6 random ""words"" madeup of random characters like ""hewue"" and crap like that (terrible seed word practices, the eff does an excellent writeup on the matter at https://www.eff.org/dice ) 

And THEN (get this!) they tell you multiple times... ""THIS SEED WORD IS USELESS WITHOUT A BACKUP! PLEASE TAKE A BACKUP"" (why the fuck did they force us to pick a 6 word seed then? What is it seeding? Why doesn't the backup just seed itself?)

So by now we have created and saved:

a 6 digit PIN number

a password

a seed phrase

a JSON ""backup of the wallet""

Seems a little redundant... or seems like the person who wrote this wallet has no idea what a seed phrase or a deterministic wallet even is.

So we bought the $100 of ripple, and now we have to send it to her account. No fees, GREAT! This is the future (tm)!

I sent it as a withdrawal from the exchange 3 hours ago now, and her wallet still isn't ""activated"" yet.

Oh, and this is the best part! $100 only bought her ~57 ripple (she's made a few bucks and she is through the roof happy which is awesome!) ... but she is forced to keep 20 ripple in her account to ""prevent spam on the network"".

So really... she can only ever spend 37 ripple.

And if the 20 ripple are in her account to stop spam on the network... why has it taken 3 hours for the ripple she purchased to show up in her account?

tl;dr ... buy some ripple if only to profit from the bankster pump and dump, but their technology and their values are absolute CRAP... and they should be removed from coinmarketcap.com imho.

"Some info:

- xrp is not used by the banks

- Ripple (the company) is promoting their network (not xrp currently) to the banks, the Ripple network is basically swift 2.0 to transfer funds (again, not xrp atm), so banks can build their apps on top of their network and allow users to send funds faster using Ripple network instead of swift. Note: the banks can allow xrp option in their Ripple network but it's stupid to do so since it's very volatile 

- Ripple network success has nothing to do with XRP, I believe xrp price rise is fully speculation and confused people thinking banks are using XRP.

"Very little detail to reinforce one's own ideology in hopes of driving up the price of BTC is transparent. It's okay, though. Not going to trash other coins, each are here for different purposes, but one common thread is to make money for whatever purpose that may be. 

EDIT: The reality is that everything literally everything that exists outside the mainstream and makes it into the mainstream (especially something that threatens the very system that has been in place for decades) eventually gets integrated into the system and this includes BTC and every other altcoin out there. XRP just happened to have been developed to integrate into an already existing system and will in some way revolutionize the banking system something you do not want to hear, but true. 

I feel your pain man, ideology and a vision of what the world could really be like by destroying the system is a great vision to have. Take it from an old punk rocker from the late 70s and early 80s who wanted to fuck the system up in a big way. We were wildly naive. Over time even punk bands were integrated into the system because it became mainstream and record companies saw it could make them money. This is one such example. 

I am not saying give up the struggle, just don't be blinded by ideology to the point of making mistakes. If you want to make money, make it then use it in alternative ways.

"I would tend to ignore XRP. As you say, it is not decentralised, their blockchain is useless since the company can change whatever they want, and XRP is unused.

How to ignore it: removing it from coinmarketcap. Stopping its spread over exchanges (for instance, it is so far from the definition of a cryptocurrency that GDAX will not offer it, it does not fit their guidelines).

I cannot actually find anything that explains how the tokens are distributed, other than reference to some ""giveaways"" in the early days.  In most regards, Ripple/XRP is not centralized (despite the FUD), as no central authority selects ""chosen validators"".  But it does indeed look like Ripple Labs minted the full supply of the tokens and distributes them ""on a schedule"" to parties of their discretion.  Do they sell them?  Give them away?  My Google-fu is failing me.  Either way, that does indeed put them in a role of central bank.  That doesn't give them power over transactions, but it does allow them to effectively gatekeep the system (until the last tokens enter circulation, anyway).

"I hear a lot of bash going back and forth on what is better so lets just put this into perspective.

RIPPLE IS NOT A CURRENCY. period. It is mainly used from my understanding for liquidity and the transfer of currency quickly and cheaply which will be very important for all your bitcoins, shitcoins, unicorncoins or whatever fiat fetish you are into since currently banks still control the 99% and until THEY fully accept cryptos the world as a whole will not. Until the day I can go to my bank and purchase a crypto currency all of this is worth nothing but speculation and a hype train. 

I cant see why people are trying to bash ripple as being worthless since it isn't a currency, but in my opinion you are investing in THE COMPANY not the COIN. Ripple offers a service to banks which seems much more valuable then what is currently being used and IMO it has the highest chances of entering this tiny crypto community and into the stock markets.

"Look, there's a hell of hype now surrounding Ripple & XRP, right now the market cap on XRP is more than every other crypto save BTC and do you know why?

Because it will probably get used more than every other crypto, and I would honestly guess it will get used more than BTC eventually too.

This space, let's be honest, is speculative as fuck. While I love it here and have made a lot of money and hope to continue to do so for quite some time, again if we're honest, this is a really small little world. It is mostly filled with geeks, nerds, tech heads, early adopters who now claim to be investment experts, a whole bunch of people talking shit and an astoundingly large number of complete fucking idiots who have no idea what the hell is going on. Yes the space has gotten bigger, yes it has attracted a bunch more people, and yes there are also the idealists, the visionaries, the genius revolutionaries, and so many incredible minds and awesome people.

I also love the idea that crypto will change the world, revolutionize the economy, bring peace in the middle east and vastly improve my vehicle situation...

But outside of this little world, is the real world. That's where the bankers live, the big institutions, where most people haven't even heard of this world and those who have, have only heard of bitcoin and ethereum and couldn't explain the difference between the two if their lives depended on it. 

Despite the claims, I don't think most cryptos are going to be adopted anywhere near as much as the hype suggests or most people are gambling on, and that's what most of this is, to be honest, speculative gambling. I highly doubt people are going to go to the store and scroll through a list of their BTC, BCH, Dash, Monero, or XVG wallets to see what they will use to quickly pay for their coffee and croissant that is easier and cheaper than handing over cash or swiping your paypass chipped card. Because if we're honest, its not easier. 

Sure many of these cryptos will grow, perhaps some will die, some will get adopted more, and this is the early days...

But XRP doesn't really give a fuck about that idealized, romanticised crypto-fuelled Utopia and has never pretended to. It is a private, centralized company, with massive institutional backing, solving a real-world problem and addressing a real-world need, in a more efficient way than is currently offered. 

XRP is kicking ass right now yes, because of hype. Yes, because of speculation. But mostly because it has real-world uses that are far far greater than this tiny little world. The thing about this little world is that the longer you spend in here, the more important you think it is.

Just my two cents worth... ";712;33;False;King_Chickawawa;drxxq7n;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"For being so educated on XRP, frankly you don't seem to either not be able to answer your own points but rather make them questions, or present falsities on some matters.

1) Ripple lab's XRP ledger is a blockchain, but each node takes the place of what miners do. So if XRP doesn't use a blockchain, I could easily say BTC doesn't because a ""trusted network"" is the one verifying transactions.

1.5) Those trusted nodes select which they trust, and transactions are sent across the shortest path of trusted nodes between one another. So it is like using a trusted individual to act as an intermediary to give funds to someone else, while allowing them to also hand it off to an individual they trust until it gets to an individual the person you are sending to trusts.

2) There is no mining, 100 billion coins is the maximum that will ever exist and currently over half is in an escrow contract meaning that it is frozen for so many months and 1 billion is released monthly...anything that isn't purchased by financial institutions is put back into a 54 month escrow contract. On top of that transaction fees aren't paid to anyone, they are burned into the ether making it a deflationary currency.

3) You are correct in that XRP isn't fully required...but in order to open an account on the XRP ledger you have to fund the minimum reserve which is inaccessible funds used solely for transactions. Nodes can use fee voting to raise or lower this reserve as prices increase making the XRP usable by the account for other purposes.

4) Yes it is somewhat centralized...but it also isn't to a degree as well. The only real centralization issue is when one party controls a majority of XRP...which is an issue with all currencies. Them working with banks to solve real financial problems isn't what makes it centralized. Right now Ripple labs is removing 1 of its nodes for every 2 third party nodes that come into existence in an attempt to not be subject to a 51% attack and has the goal of being more decentralized that bitcoin. Yes it is a goal on paper and may be a false promise so I can understand being bearish about those claims.

4-5) Also, posting a few words and raising concerns isn't explaining how those things are problems...it is showing your lack of information on those matters.

Overall, if you don't like XRP, think it is a scam coin, or just dislike the fact that Ripple Labs is a fintech company working with the banking industry....that is fine...but I personally am bullish on the coin used in a technology intended to free up the 27 trillion dollars locked up in nostro accounts, which would almost double the amount of narrow money available to use globally...because once you add liquidity to banking and ALL fiat currency has the ability to be liquid, every legitimate crypto is going to fair better as it fills in as a substitute for fiat...because right now what good is replacing fiat currency if most global wealth is just sitting around as it is and not moving? In my opinion disliking XRP and Ripple labs is short sighted because what they are doing is the first step in making cryptos actually have the ability to *replace* fiat.

Plus I enjoy having 5 second transaction times.

EDIT: Also, if you are coming over from the Ripple sub don't engage in brigading...not only is it hella childish but some of the concerns individuals are raising over XRP is valid...all we can do is try to inform individuals who are lacking in information...the goal for all of us should be to legitimize cryptocurrencies as what they were intended for: a currency. That can't happen though if the different communities are too busy fighting with one another to address their preferred currencies own flaws in order to push for innovations. But that also means we should listen to others concerns and engage in rational conversation that isn't muddied by our own personal opinions and emotions.";765;35;False;AtlaStar;drxzno6;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

Any extra XRP from the 1 billion not distributed (gifted or sold to investors/banks) in 30 days, goes back into escrow for the remaining 55 months. For comparison, Ripple has sold on average 300 million XRP per month for the past 18 months. https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/

"**Ripple Directs Bitstamp to Freeze Funds of Former Co-Founder Jed McCaleb**

McCaleb and Ripple signed a contract in the earlier days of Ripple that  basically stated that McCaleb was only allowed to sell or trade weekly batches of XRP worth at most US$10,000. 

According to Ripple, however, McCaleb tried to trade 96 million XRP worth around US$1 million in a single batch, which they claim broke the agreement. Ripple instantly demanded Bitstamp reverse the funds and return all 96,342,361.6 XRP to McCaleb.

All that is required for Ripple to freeze user funds is to notify them of suspicious or unusual activity in their accounts and to simply ask the gateways to freeze or even reverse the funds.

"I have always been a bitcoin maximalist. Ultimately I think there will be one crypto that takes the lions share and is most widely used as money. It is inefficient for people to be using many different forms of money and I think one day we will settle on a single crypto. I think it will be based on the bitcoin ledger due to the network effects and history, but I am not convinced it will be BTC. I only hold BCH so I may be biased but I think that is the version of Bitcoin that has the best prospects to become the one world currency. 

I dont have an opinion on XMR. It obviously has utility and therefor value for private transactions but I dont hold any.

I dont know a lot about the details on STEEM but the concept is interesting. I struggle to comprehend how a token that is for a specific purpose will have an advantage over a token that is widely used as money. If BCH becomes the #1 coin and is widely used and accepted, what would be the purpose of have site specific tokens? Couldnt a site integrate BCH to reward all readers and contributors and eliminate the conversions from STEEM-BCH and back? Maybe I fail to understand the steem incentives and model.

Smart contracts seem to be useful and have a lot of potential, but again I don't see the value of having a separate token. I believe that if the Core developers were more inviting and easier to work with, Vitalik would have built Ethereum on top of the bitcoin block chain.

"AFAIK and if my memory serves, Ripplepay was created even (far?) before BTC.

BTC is literally killing the ""small"" users in having both a high price, a high fee and a high delay; it has progressively killed attemps to open crypto to the markets (Steam, Newegg, spaceshift...)

BCH has one (only) default: to be in concurrence with Bitcoin, BUT still having a relatively close name: so, is it an enemy, a friend, a replacement? Communication may be complicated.

Somewhere - I guess people are get bored of all this shit.

Regular users use a crypto to send 50 or 100$.

They don't give a shit about premine or 51% attack or LN or maternodes or EDA or whatever geek technology.

They don't care about security/risks, or just as much as you use a bank note, is it a good one, a copy? We normally should NOT have to care.

In short, I think saying ""this Ripple shit is ridiculous"" is at the same level of /r/bitcoin saying ""bcash is shitcoin"".

What's funny is every aspect of this currency (Ripple) that is unlike Bitcoin is every added reason why this coin will survive as a cyrptocurrencies digital currency for small transactions on a large scale. Meanwhile Bitcoin can't even function optimally as a large scale large transactions currency. Bitcoin is a failed experiment, like Yahoo. Meanwhile Ripple is focusing on a singular utilization, doing it optimally better than any other currency, and the centrality of control Ripple as a company holds over Ripple will only lead to more unified future developments and they will seek deals that benefit the corportation and currency as a whole. Meanwhile the Bitcoin developers are divided and all seeking to exploit the protocol for their singular benefit instead of seeking to make decisions that will benefit the currency.

"Banks serve legitimate purposes in the market and will continue to do so until decentralized services do a lot more than what any single cryptocurrency does now.

No, the point of bitcoin is to become money...not just another payment network. Commercial banks do not hold a monopoly on money or the issuance of currency. They can be in fact, currency-agnostic.  Only governments and their central banks monopolize money and have the legitimized power to initiate force against peaceful people. 

The state is, and has always been the enemy of freedom and decentralization. Bitcoin is inherently anti-state, and its time that new bitcoiners realized or learned this. If banks are capable of harming us, it is only through the state.

This juvenile anti-banking zietgeist needs to die. Many of the functions of banks will be just as necessary in a world where bitcoin or another crypto becomes money, and fractional reserve mechanisms will become necessary in a free-banking and competitive money environment, in order to accommodate shocks and alleviate deflationary ills like price and wage stickiness.

"Your missing the point as well as many others. The bickering amongst the btc and bch communities is childish and caused a great divide over nothing. At the same time btc has proven useless because it requires second coin, ltc and it’s fees are through the roof. So attention has been removed from the technology and focused on too much Jerry Springer crap. Meanwhile XRP has kept their heads down and focused on a solution that banks want and is attempting to offer a product that banks can use to lower fees in their business model as well as other features.

So if btc or bch would like to gain back the steam they had maybe they should spend less time arguing amongst them selves, spouting negative marketing and message board fodder and instead focus on providing a usuable product to the consumer or businesses? That would be: a product that is faster and easier to use than PayPal or Venmo, accepted everywhere like visa, and has lower fees than traditional banking options or credit.

Instead of using nostro accounts and basically trade IOU's between banks the video (I watched in the comment below) says you can now use xrp which is an actual asset with value. Who decides what value it has? Say ripple is worth 2usd right now and you send 1 million xrp to me.

Who says those 1mil xrp are worth 2 million dollars?

Did you buy em for 2 million usd?

Can I sell them for 2 million dollars?

What happens if the price fluctuates even 1% in the time of sending?

> Ripple Labs asked Bitstamp, one of their many payment gateways, to place an “individual freeze” on the funds of McCaleb on March 21, after the company discovered that the former co-founder tried to trade 96 million XRP.

> McCaleb and Ripple signed a contract in the earlier days of Ripple that  basically stated that McCaleb was only allowed to sell or trade weekly batches of XRP worth at most US$10,000. According to Ripple, however, McCaleb tried to trade 96 million XRP worth around US$1 million in a single batch, which they claim broke the agreement. Ripple instantly demanded Bitstamp reverse the funds and return all 96,342,361.6 XRP to McCaleb.

"People forget that Ripple actually exceeded Bitcoin in market cap once back in 2013. The market cap metric is completely bogus for something like XRP where Ripple Labs holds a gigantic premine. For example, I could premine a trillion ForkiusCoins, sell one on Yobit to a friend for $1, and boom, instant trillion-dollar market cap. 

We know Ripple is not at all comparable and doesn't have the resistance to attack that most other cryptocurrencies do. It was Ryan Fugger's 2003 idea that Ripple Labs (then called OpenCoin) revived and tacked a totally superfluous coin onto in a crass effort to raise capital by riding the altcoin wave, then marketed the heck out of it to big financial institutions and governments who were clueless about this stuff. It's a boondoggle that will go nowhere except maybe making a more efficient SWIFT, but I doubt even that as they haven't solved the decentralized trust issue that Bitcoin solved. 

We can keep building the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem without worrying about the nominal market cap of massive premines or whatever the pump of the week is. The best coin will win.

"I think a lot of what you said, which I liked in that it was very blunt, can bring most people down to earth; Although lets not forget what is still happening. You have to remember, Bitcoin is solving issues already in other countries, people are saving their money while their economy collapses - as well in Asia they are already preparing for digital currency. Also, tell someone from 2013 that the price of bitcoin is $14,000 - I am sure they will think the governments across the world were collapsing and that bitcoin was for sure taking over. 

Ripple might as well keep growing - but really it's more like a crypto-coin-stock than what true cryptocoins are. It has it's place, which is great, I for sure own some in my portfolio. But because of it's rise, it does not all of sudden reveal how insignificant, fantasy, geek like the rest of crypto is. We have NO idea what the whales are trying to stir up.

But let's put that aside... Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee... Pretty much every crypto can do that. Fuck, DOGE can do that, with even lower fees and it's a freggin meme coin. Only difference is Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms.

Banks are going to be able to save 30-60% in fees, whilst crypto can bypass banks and (excluding Bitcoin) can save 99%+ of the fees. Guess who's going to win out?

Oh and did I mention that all the margin profits that Ripple Labs will get from banks for implementing their product goes 100% to Ripple Labs and company and exactly 0% to XRP hodlers? Yep.

"> Look up what their escrow contract is and does before pulling out definitions of words please

Why do I have to look up what it does? It sounds like you're trying to make the concept complicated so people can't argue well against it. Let's keep things simple, shall we? :)

I repeat: the DICTIONARY definition of escrow is something held so two parties can complete a transaction https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/escrow

If Ripple Labs is one party who is the other? If you can't specify who the other party is why use the word in that way? 

>As to your other arguments, it is no different than mining pools hoarding Bitcoin and selling it later at a profit

Umm, yes, its VERY different. Mining pools compete openly in a free market for a supply that NONE of them controlled initially. 

>That said, your concerns are valid in a sense...

Thank you for admitting this.

>it is easy to mistrust something, especially when that something is dealing with another person/group/thing you already distrust.

I don't trust nor distrust Ripple Labs. I'm looking at the entire situation objectively. If I meet you on the street, and I don't know you, and you ask me to hand you all the money in my wallet it seems like you're saying I'm at fault for ""distrusting"" that you would give it back. My point is, why should we start things off with  you getting all my money in the first place? Trust has nothing to do with it. There is no point putting you in such a controlling position, is there? Sure you might see the point since you're in control, but what if we switched things around?

This is exactly right. This is what these haters are missing. Ripples focus is not peer to peer or decentralization.

"Superb response.
Was aware of the 5 trillion per day in x-border settlements...

And this, coupled with the non-banking use case can lead to an xrp price of around $5.60 -- see post xrp's Drake equation.

Was not aware of the nostro acccounts and that xrp could free up 21 trillion of fiat ccy that is locked up.

That surely benefits everyone... as fiat is debt issued and we are all paying for this locked up debt.

">  Ripple lab's XRP ledger is a blockchain

No. call it a distributed ledger if you want, but a blockchain that claims to be trustworthy without having access to some of its earlier blocks is by definition not a blockchain. The fact that all the consensus nodes are controlled by one entity and that nobody else can join in the fun is also a strong hint.

It's not a blockchain, it's barely a cryptocurrency, it's a centrally controlled database that borrowed just enough of the blockchain concepts to ride on its buzz without doing any of the actual work.

That doesn't mean it's a bad product. Paypal, Venmo and all those guys are all doing terrific fintech things, and I'm sure some of the many Ripple announcements will translate into visible products someday too. But folks should spend a little time understanding what it is they're buying when they decide XRP is their next big bet.

"> but is it probable?

That's kind of why I wanted to get those numbers out of you. But let's talk probable: Worldwide growth of bandwidth availability will continue along with worldwide decrease in bandwidth cost. That's HIGHLY probable.

But will BCH get to Visa-level transaction traffic (2,000 txs per second) before bandwidth can catch up? Processing that level of traffic will require 300mb blocks, or 16 terabytes per year of data added to the Blockchain. How much bandwidth does the average developed area of the world need to have in your eyes to handle this in a decentralized manner?

Absolutely. 

I haven't had time yet to read the details but I have seen talk of $21T missing / unaccounted for over last 10 something years. Modern central bank fiat was invented to enable war making and given the number of wars lately it is likely (if that money is really missing) it was put into advanced weapons and intelligence related work. 

If cryptocurrencies ever manage to penetrate the real economy at even a marginal degree it would be catastrophic for the military industrial complex and nation state military. That is a very big concern to western intelligence I am sure.

"**Development of Duke Nukem Forever**

The video game Duke Nukem Forever spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a first-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, developed by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996.

">People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

XRP tokens are not only centralized and private but also useless, they were meant to be a web payment gateway. And it was used like that in the early days. Bitstamp for example would accept deposits in XRP that you would buy directly from Ripple that would be converted to USD. You could not trade XRP at Bitstamp, it was just a gateway to USD. Then the payment gateway original concept was abandoned and those tokens became legacy in Ripple's system.

Let me assure you, they do not make anything close to that from their private blockchain products. Their products are sold as fee-cutting, so they really can't charge more than few cents per transactions. So they make maybe few million dollars from that.

XRP is their cash cow. They created a myth that Ripple Inc. relationship with banks will create a lot of use for XRP in the long term, and crypto traders were happy to buy it.

As virtually no transactions actually make use of SegWit, that really isn't relevant, nor does it change the fact that BCH will not have comparable fees if it has the same transaction volume LTC does today, which was your original claim.

Roger is ""pumping"" it the same as he was ""pumping"" Bitcoin for years already. By doing PR and building companies around it. Consider that he has a lot of wealth in BTC and now also BCH. It was never in his interest to simply ruin Bitcoin. Nor would it be in the interest of Jihan Wu (Bitmain). Instead they have bootstrapped a fork and are slowly transfering their wealth there.

They could have simpled HODLD their coins, watched as investors drove Bitcoin much higher and had a more liquid market to sell into later. But they didn't. Instead they are emptying their own BTC pockets slowly and at some point, should they not decide to stop, they won't have any left.

The actual reason for the fork was a long debate, which was not open and fair but often censored and manipulated. BTC devs don't care about Satoshi or the original vision we had going anymore. It's not the main chain that they want to see adopted. They are in it to build a product on top of the blockchain, which is likely to be more easily censored and shut down.

"False. BCH will not have the same fees when it has the same transaction volume as LTC, and LTC doesn't have the same fees as BTC did at the same volume.

---

BTC 1MB blocks per 10 minutes = 6MB/hour

LTC 1MB blocks per 2.5 minutes = 24MB/hour

BCH 8MB blocks per 10 minutes = 48MB/hour

BCH 32MB blocks per 10 minutes (soon) = 192MB/hour

---

Today, BCH can handle twice (48/24) LTC's maximum transaction volume before fees become important, and once the planned fork to 32MB goes through, it will be able to handle (192/24) 8 times LTC's maximum transaction volume before that point.

BCH's blocksize is below 100k still on average, meaning it can handle at least 320 times the current volume before we run into any kind of scaling issue causing the fees to rise.

The roadmap for BCH is that the blocksize is scaled _before_ transaction volume exceeds available space, keeping fees below 0.2 _cents_.";2;1;False;Bootrear;dry4r59;Thank to this community's effort, Forbes has corrected Kyle's Torpey's LN article to clarify LTC tx fees is much higher than BCH.

"No. Miners want fees and zero fee transactions permit a lot of spamming. Technically you can send no fee transactions on BCH as could you with Bitcoin. Don't expect them to go through (or in the case of BCH to be very delayed).

One of the things  many miners on this sub forget about is miners want fees they also don't want their blocks to be orphaned. So miners impose soft caps on the block size for the blocks they mine and only up those softcaps as they feel necessary. So again only the highest bidders can work their way into the blocks. This earn miners more fees and it reduces their orphan rate by decreasing block propagation time. Miners will only up the soft caps when they feel it necessary to prevent users from abandoning the blockchain their mining and when they feel the risk/reward of increased orphan rates are worth it and to be made up for by higher volume of transactions.

"Most receiving wallets are not smart enough to show a tx as RBF. And even if they are, the merchant needs to specify a complicated payment process where they tell the user pay in crypto, but dont use RBF. Then the user would say: I dont know if I have RBF on. The merchant would then need to have some tech support to help the user figure it out.

This is high amount of friction and will cause most merchants to ""Nope"" out of accepting such crypto. Imagine a merchant accepting $100 cash needing to check if the Ben Franklin on the note is winking and if so, the cash could just disappear from the register over the next 4 hours. Its simpler to not accept $100 than to create a process and train all cashiers on how to properly handle $100 bills.

Again, aren't RBF transactions clearly flagged as such, especially if the merchant uses a payment processor like Bitpay?... ;1;1;False;Disgruntled_AnCap;drymsnq;True winning is not about the coin price.

"I don't know about the US, but here in Europe cashiers definitely need to be trained to handle €100 bills, they always check them for counterfeits... But anyway, that's besides the point.

The fact that most receiving wallets are not smart enough to show a tx as RBF is indicative of a problem with most receiving wallets, not RBF itself, and honestly, I don't think we're at a stage where **most merchants** can use **most wallets yet**. I think we can agree that we absolutely need to get there eventually, but I don't think neither BTC nor BCH, nor any other crypto is really there yet.

Besides, while the market is still so volatile, payment processors like bitpay play a very important role. There's not going to be more people arguing with a merchant that's telling them that their payment processor doesn't take those kind of transactions than there are arguments because a merchants POS won't take American Express.

As more adoption of crypto continues to spread and the prices consequently begin to stabilise, merchants will be able to move their slider on their bitpay account page to keep ever higher proportions of crypto. And such adoption will require software such as wallets to improve greatly. Meaning that by the time *""most merchant""* are willing to go full crypto and stop using processors, wallets should definitely be much better.
