"Compare the mempool. Sure, maybe same amount of tx's/block (due to 1mb+SW limit) but not the same amount of tx's in queue to get into a block.

"Of course it's not the same txs in the mempool, that's the whole point of increasing capacity, to reduce txs in the mempool. Since txs today = txs one year ago, this proves beyond doubt that SegWit did function as a capacity increase. (Fees, btw, are ridiculously low.)

Wanna try again? Hint: Usage = Txs in blocks, NOT txs in the mempool.
