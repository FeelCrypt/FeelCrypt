The bottom line is none of this would be a problem if mining was still being done on millions of people's CPUs around the world. 

Large quantities of people tend to make proper important decisions.

The only reason the developers have any pull right now is because mining is so centralized and too few people are making the decision whether to adopt what core wants.

And that goes both directions. If there were millions of miners making the final decision, it may go full-bore towards SegWit. 

But at least then I would feel comfortable that a large number of really smart people (with probably some dumb ones mixed in), made the decision.

"Thinking there is a fixed hierarchy is where you went wrong.   CEOs code, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates are probably the most successful ones.  Then theres the Steve Jobs, Woz combo, which again defies your worldview because without Woz's passion for building cool shit, Jobs wouldn't have anyone to lead the technical aspects.  

If anyone here is overrating their importance in society, it's you. 

Scientists build cool shit because they want to, and the rate of innovation is only accelerating because we've been actively reducing the barriers to entry by encouraging FOSS.   Did CEOs or managers think FOSS was a good idea???   Nope, It was a threat to their profits!

FOSS is a movement of people that don't need permission or top down guidance to innovate and change the world.   Bitcoin is just another one of those projects that break the barriers to entry and allows the next generation of coders to build on top of our hard work for free.

Our fight for decentralization ensures that Bitcoin remains accessible to developers in as many countries as possible for innovation.   We're still in the early days of Bitcoin, and focusing on hardforks and 20 cents fees is completely missing the forest from the trees.

Miners will come and go,. eventually they'll be commoditized anyway.  I'm not worried about their health.  They appear to have entered into the game without understanding the system.  They're locked in an arms race(dynamic difficulty), and a race to the bottom at the same time(reducing block reward).

They'll try fighting us a few more times before they realize they are powerless to the consensus.

"> Where does Ryan X Charles say that?

I'm not sure if you know this, but Twitter is a public social media platform.  When you tweet something, everyone on the planet has a chance to access and engage with that tweet, unless blocked by the user.  Ryan X Charles doesn't afford me that right, the nature of Twitter does.  Block is meant as a protection against harassment and it was just abused by Ryan X Charles for whatever reason.

>You'll now no doubt argue that /r/bitcoin doesn't make such claims either.

No doubt: Where does /r/bitcoin say that?  Hint: it doesn't.

>That strongly suggests that it's a discussion forum for bitcoin rather than a very specific interpretation.

Unfortunately, reality doesn't operate in the way that you think it should - it operates in the way that it does.  A specific person founded the subreddit and it's controlled by moderators that were trusted by that original creator.  They get to decide what discussions take place there - not anyone else.

Do you see how I'm using your own arguments against you?  Are you willing to concede that Ryan X Charles is a disingenuous hypocrite yet?  Again, the nuance is important.

>You may not accept that view but surely you'll concede that the act of deleting comments without trace (without notifying the user as you found out yourself) is underhand.
