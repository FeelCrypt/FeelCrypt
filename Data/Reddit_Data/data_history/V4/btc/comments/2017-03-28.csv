"I've proposed a plausible model for:

1. What happens to Bitcoin (it is being destroyed)
2. How it happens (community sabotage, lies, deceit, etc.)
3. How people involved in it are motived (by personal greed, bribery)
4. Who profits from this despite them losing money on it (the establishment)
5. How it will affect future prospects of other cryptocurrencies (not well)
6. How it is not a grand conspiracy but just the normal way society is patterned to work (shaped by those in power)

And all you have to offer in the way of logic, reasoning and indpendent thought is dismiss it as irrelevant.

">O yes... the China Firewall...

it takes less than 7 seconds to get a 1MB block to propagate from the West through the  ""China Firewall"" we have 10 minutes. 

looking at these 6 inerrant features that limit block size miners have all the tools they need to manage block size if we remove the limit.

These are the 6 intrinsic limits I have not seen dis-proven. they need to be debunked or understood. BU allows the network to come to terms and understand them in time.  

1. Compact blocks and Xthin blocks need to relay increasing missing transactions with growth - the closer the block size gets to network capacity the greater the number of transactions that will have not fully propagated the network. Missing transactions need to propagate before they can be validated in a block. When transactions are missing orphan risk increases as the number of missing transactions increases validation time increase as does orphan risk. - *there is a very real cost that deters including more transactions than the network can handle.*   

2. There is headers first mining and it can be abused to mine higher capacity than the network can handle - it comes with significantly orphan risk, - the optimization here being all headers are the same size, in this case validation times increase orphan risk making this practice is very risky, - *there is a very real cost that deters this practice.* 

3. Compact blocks and Xthin have to communicate information in the bloom filter that increases with the quantity of transactions in the block - bloom filters describing more transaction are larger, and larger amounts of information take longer to propagate and validate, larger blocks increase orphan risk. - *there is a very real cost that deters including more transactions than the network can handle.*  

4. Another optimization is parallel validation, here too smaller blocks are advantaged by propagating early increasing the risk of orphaning larger blocks when two block are found at a similar time. - *there is a very real cost that deters including more transactions than the network can handle.* 

5. There is an inherent mechanism to processing very large blocks that may take over 10 minus to validate, - firstly they can be orphaned by any previously mentions method, or can be built on and secured by mining empty blocks. in the later case fewer transactions are processed creating a backlog and a technical limit and a fee market. - *there is a very real cost that deters including more transactions than the network can handle, and an incentive to cost optimize available network capacity*

6. Like the majority network today miners will not deviate from the 1MB as the majority of users would reject that block, the same is true of use adjustable limits, BS/Core and BU depend on relay nodes to enforce a network limit.  Although with a user set limit when transaction volume increases above capacity miners can be fooled with a sibil attack into making bigger block, miners have a very big intensive to avoid orphan blocks. 

In all of these cases there exist counterarguments - however if you are aloud to explore them honestly you will see the counterarguments are superficial. I have explored every one I'm aware of on bitcoi.in/forum over the last 3 years. - the only obstetrical I see now is an opportunity to discuss them in a constructive and analytical environment. - one free of censorship and trolling 

The rebuttals to the criticisms of these points have been censored from r/bitcoin Bitcoin IRC, Slack, bitcointalk.org and other pleases. if there exists valid criticism they must withstand critical analysis free of personal attacks and censorship.

"> Why would you not invest a tiny bit in crypto?

Because I believe that the expected return is negative, for one thing.  (If reducing risk was the only goal, the best strategy would be to convert all my savings into cash and burn it.)

Also, the high volatility would imply that the investment would have to be very small, and would reduce the overall risk only a little.  Not worth the hassle.

Finally, investing in crypto seems to impair one's reasoning abilities.  Makes one believe in fairy tales like ""economic majority owns the network"", ""full but non-mining nodes protect against bad miners"", ""miners can be fired by changing the PoW formula"", ""the LN is ready, just waiting for SegWit"", ""the 21 M cap will never be changed"", etc...";2;1;False;jstolfi;dfiftce;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

"I'm saying that non technical users like myself should not be allowed to lead development, nowhere in my post history you will find me advocating for or against any of the dev teams.

Because it ends up in mob mentality. We are at it now. People choose sides not based on technical expertise but based on politics.

I fail to see how a developer that has produced code that is widely accepted and reviewed from his peers should have a less valuable opinion from me that i only have money to spend on startups. 

I am not trying to take a side to the debate, because (at least in my eyes) the people who are competent technically have spoken.

Look at linux in contrast with Apple/MS. 

While the two latter have a gigantic share of the PC markets in their pockets, it is the linux community that is far quicker and more adaptive to solving problems/bugs. 

I am not a coder to be able to evaluate the kernels in each product, but apple/ms have far less developers than the linux community. 
Therefore my trust lies with the open majority of linux.

Same applies to the issue at hand. On one side you have btc and its developers, that belong to more than one team, on the other hand you have a vocal majority of users that attacks devs on the basis of their subjective beliefs of who is the cutest.

Do users of fiat have a say in the monetary policies of central banks? Should we trust the mob in making monetary or fiscal decisions?

If we dont allow that, why should people that have a balance in their wallets be allowed to have a say in how bitcoin is to evolve?

Should we allow one mining company dictate the fate of the network? Should the network allow one stakeholder exercise control over it?

"> The protocol implementations and the technical decisions should be left to the various developer teams that exist in the ecosystem.

Which should always be Core, right?

> No matter how much i disagree with Core/XT/Classic/Unlimited i cant allow other non-techical users exersice control over it.

There are plenty of ""technical users"" who have supported each project. Just none have had the network effect and money behind Core.

> The rift the community is in was created because non technical users tried to apply political solutions to technical problems.

No, the current rift happened because the lead programmer stepped down in 2014 and was subsequently shut out of any future development. Gavin knew the blocksize was going to be a problem, and didn't think a non-technical issue would block its increase. Who was in charge of Core when the last hard fork happened? Who was lead dev from 2010 - 2014?

So who is pushing a political solution on technical problems? One side wants to keep the protocol largely the same but increase some artificial limits (which would require careful planning for a fork), or another side which is bolting on new pieces to the block (while promising an optional soft fork).

> And it does not work like that, does it?

I don't get what you're saying. You're last comment was disparaging the previous comment for wanting leaders.

This push is necessary, because the layer 2 network (whatever it turns out to be) will not be usable, and will not reduce the on-chain traffic, unless most bitcoin users switch to it.

"> I hope I am wrong.

Each to their own. But I strongly believe that you are wrong.

IMHO (really, just my 2 satoshi here) you're apparently jumping into another implementation in the belief of cryptocurrency equivalence and comparing that to facebook vs myspace. I don't think that comparison holds. I do think that Bitcoin with a released block size limit will improve and perhaps rather rapidly. Could be that you later find you jumped just at the wrong time.

Appreciate nonetheless your work in this forum as moderator, and I wish you every success.

"I think that article is confusing effort with Proof of Work.  (I'll use ""effort"" just to help distinguish from PoW)

Proof of Work focuses human effort into creating specific hardware for specific computations in a manner that allows for centralization.  Bitcoin's PoW is also doing it in a way that has a large built-in incentive to do this through the block subsidy.  In effect, there is a large hurdle to have capabilities to manufacture ASICs, but then there is a large reward for anyone who does this.

Other systems for block validation may balance the theoretical equation of expended human effort rising to equality with the system reward - but not necessarily with the same initial hurdle or with the same relative reward size.  Even this discussion in bitcion will change over time as the block subsidy decreases (and when blocksize limit changes).

"Ethereum and any other altcoin can be as many ""steps further ahead"" as they want. Fact is real world companies already accept Bitcoin and they dont care about anything else.

If Bitcoin gets dropped by those companies, then crypto will get dropped altogether.

"Well for example, one could reason the current low price of bitcoin (yes I know the market cap is at an ATH, but in relation to the massive boom in altcoins, bitcoin is struggling comparatively, you have to look at the bigger picture here) is due to uncertainty. Uncertainty is what keeps investors worried and reluctant to invest in anything because there's no telling what will happen in the near, medium or distant future.       
Right now, it's unclear what will happen to bitcoin, will BU win? Will Core win? Will someone else win? Will no one win and the stagnation continue? No one knows. That's what makes it scary.    
No matter which side you want to win, or even if you're neutral, investing right now is risky because there's no guarantee anyone will win at the moment.         
If any side shows clear signals of having won the debate, and the debate ending, then that alone removes uncertainty. The potential investors who agree with that side will then have the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is and invest in the side they truly believe in.     
The ones who are neutral and just want bitcoin to succeed will also invest.    
The ones who were of the opposing side but don't have a strong opinion on the matter might also think that even though they don't like the winning side that much, it's still better than altcoins, so they invest anyway, or at least a little.   
Only the truly die-hard supporters of the losing side would switch to altcoins (which would not hurt bitcoin that much) and maybe even short bitcoin or actively fight bitcoin. Which may hurt bitcoin a little at first, but if they are truly the minority they will not strongly affect bitcoin.       
I think it's pretty likely to play out similarly to that, because honestly, a lot of people don't care a lot about which side wins.     
People who care are more likely to post, people who don't care don't post, so they're the non-vocal majority.       
I think BU should win, and if SegWit wins I'll move most of my bitcoin towards altcoins, but I'll still keep a few bitcoin just in case. And I think even if SegWit wins, the price will rise a little. At least at first.     
But I think it's still far healthier for bitcoin, both short and long term, if BU wins.";1;0;False;zimmah;dfield6;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

Probably because Dash has no developer community, or community in general. Has an almost inactive GitHub in comparison, and exhibits several properties of a ponzi-like scam.

The best way to end this is for core to stop banning and censoring and engage  in actual honest discussion with the big block contingent. Does anyone think that is going to happen? No?

Show me a real life company that accepts Bitcoin that actually has a significant amount of clients using this option. Only dark net markets come to mind, and they support ETH and XMR too. In fact, a lot of companies ditched or are ditching their Bitcoin support due to lack of interest. Some are moving to Ethereum.

"[Not necessarily](https://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/).

ETC does seem to be in decline these days, but I suspect that's largely because the DAO fork did indeed turn out to be just a one-off aberration. Since there was no other difference between the two chains ETC started diverging from the Foundation roadmap in other regards (a lot of them are keen on keeping PoW indefinitely, for example) and the Foundation roadmap looks good to me so that seems like a bad idea.

Still, the fact that ETC survived the fork and made a decent run at sustainability is heartening to me. And since then Ethereum has added a chain ID that would allow easy replay protection, so forks like these could be even more sustainable in the future.";6;1;False;FaceDeer;dfhlxs7;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

"Good point. 

Back in 2013/4, by the way, I wasn't waiting for or being asked to wait for confirmation relating to micro payment - just transferred and walked away. And - though I didn't myself do more than a couple of larger transactions - no-one seemed to consider waiting 5 or 10 minutes for confirmations to be a practical issue when making much larger transfers. I'm imagining Bitcoin can go back to that with BU. And then to side-chains sooner than later too.
