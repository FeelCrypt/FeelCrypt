"I guess Andreas has to re-write his speeches. 

**""Banking The Banks Again""**"
1 megabyte is not a lot of data at all either. Its actually a laughable size of data given today's technology. Why are people against increasing it? 
It's not. Makes you wonder who would be pushing such an obviously false narrative, and for what purpose...? 
"Here's the current status of the global internet:
https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q1-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report.pdf

Highlights :

* Global Average Internet Connection speed reached 7.2 Mbps
* 45% Global 10Mbps broadband adoption
* The global average Internet connection increased 15% in the past year

Global connectivity and storage space prices are improving faster than we can increase Bitcoin's adoption. even before we do all the optimizations we know are possible today.

And we're arguing for the last 2 years whether sending **the equivalent of a low res cat picture** every 10 minutes is burdensome! If that's not madness, I don't know what is."

I think its important to note that even businesses don't need to download the entire blockchain with just minor changes to the block header, which would increase decentralization of non mining nodes.
The dude that invented bitcoin is said to have mined about 1,000,000 coins. At $2,800/coin that's 2.8 billion dollars. Reminds me of a pyramid scheme.
The software limits itself? Or the protocol? Because couldn't someone just fork it to *not* have that limit?
"Bitcoin isn't here to change human nature, we have to do that ourselves, individually and collectively. Bitcoin is here to provide an alternative to the onslaught of totalitarianism and the trampling of privacy globally, until we can all mature as a global species, and finally learn to take responsibility for managing our own ""ledger"" as a society, instead of delegating it to for-profit institutions that have no checking mechanisms to seigniorage and usury, and have been enriching themselves and their court, through inflation.  

Will it be equitable ? Probably not, as nothing is in life. Those with foresight and those that take risks are always rewarded to some proportion of it, but without using them, you're just a bagholder, so the proverbial ""spice"" must eventually ""flow"", regardless if you mined early or bought in 2010, or just bought your first coins. It will be a long and winding road, but this is the ledger of ownership that's kept society lubricated since the first man traded a bushel of wheat for a silver coin, and the clock's been ticking ever since. Will it be transparent, *yes*; will it be governed by a majority instead of a minority, *yes*; will you have the exact same opportunities to participate as everyone else, *yes*. 

I, and probably many others, consider even these facts alone, to be a big step forward.
The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the second best time is now."
"Like you said bitcoin needs to stabilize itself. Also if the transaction fee is 5 USD no one will use it to buy a product below 100 USD.

Also, Bitcoin isn't  a commodity. You can't build something with bitcoin and you don't use bitcoin to show off like you do with gold. Bitcoin at the moment is a bubble waiting to pop."
Its both. For an outsider you have to convince me to use this as my new cash and provide a reason for me to use it. If the practical side is fucked, you have ti convince me its unfucked
"Not my OP. I was answering your nonsense on $2 for electricity for full node.
"
Who are these people who can afford $5 transaction fees but struggle to pay for basic internet and a hard drive?
"Nonsense again. 

I will be paying for Internet even if I do no use Bitcoin. So, this cost I will ignore. Same thing with storage."

Why are you lambasting me? I am complaining about the blocks.
"Your answer is completely wrong.

...and yet you had to post anyways."
You know if it wasn't for Andreas I never would have heard of Bitcoin. I mean eventually maybe yeah, but I heard about Bitcoin when he went on to the Joe Rogan show and he's been on the show multiple times. Couldn't you argue he's reaching out to audiences that normally wouldn't have been reached? I also took the free MOOC he taught and I greatly appreciated the time he volunteered to teach Bitcoin and answer the students questions. 
[deleted]
"Nonsense? 

I am simply pointing out the true cost in the same way an accountant would. 

Your hard drive space taken up by the block chain cannot be used for anything else, so you can't say you would have it anyway. 

The ongoing bandwidth that you use cannot be used for anything else, even if you would have internet anyway. 

You can ignore these costs if you'd like, but the  you are forgoing an accurate calculation of the costs. I would say *that* is nonsense. "
My words are never nonsense. (:-)
"thought you were playing the ""it's fine, I do blah blah blah"" game, sorry, a lot of us are on edge here because we understand what needs to happen but there is a strong force at play against us "
I messed up my sentence. I agree with you. My disagreement is with those that say that people won't migrate to other coins.
It will, when everyone in the world is making 10's of transactions a day. 
Is AsicBoost the exploit that allows miners to skip part of the process, making the network less secure? Or am I confusing it with something else?
:)
Can't Core just get fired then? Who runs Blockstream and why are they still employing Core? 
ltc isnt the bubble its bitcoin. and when bitcoin pops ltc will fly. its the one with the highest chance to go up during so. thats when you offload ltc then buy at its lowest point of that fly high sell off. 
Kraken is pretty good. Then you can still buy Eth and exchange for an alt.
"I don't recommend polo.

Check my post history. "
For many coins, yes, right now I believe it's not possible to buy Sia with Ether for example.
What are you all saying 
[deleted]
"I don't, I tried several times and backed off, when I saw the fee of over $4. 

Waiting for Sunday."
"That is the cost: time and effort. Of course it's not as big of a cost as bitcoin which is why the shift is much, much slower.

> I don't agree, there are now many sites (digital exchanges) where one can very easy switch from bitcoin to other coins, and many are doing it right now.

What don't you agree? what you say is what I'm saying. We are currently seeing the switch from bitcoin to alts happening because it is much easier than ever before. Now you don't even have to get bitcoin first to get eth. You can do fiat <-> eth. It doesn't help that merchants are discontinuing the acceptance of bitcoin.

edit: to add, myspace -> facebook, you lose all of your history, comments, photos etc. so I'd say depending on how invested you were, the time loss could be pretty significant to move over, so they might have been one of the last hold outs."
dBanks.
"That right there is why there's an enormous schism in Bitcoin. 

You are correct that virtually no end user needs to download and verify the entire chain.

You are also correct that a few MB every ten mins is also a very small amount of data to be worried about. 

Isn't it amazing how clear this all is to someone that hasn't yet been brainwashed by rbitcoin? "
Unless you are a miner or a business, it's not necessary. There are a whole class of people who will try to convince you otherwise. And they are the ones who pushed for fees to be this high.
Because the inventor, Satoshi, was a computer scientist, not an economist. His idea for  a fee was to be proportional to the data required for sending a transaction, not the amount sent.
And it can all come crashing down with a 1 bitcoin transfer.
I have never used bitcoins for anything I could use Fiat currency for. Probably never will because of its volatility. It's good for black market things though
"IMO for crypto to be taken seriously as a universal currency, it *needs* to have stable value and not be treated like a stock. Early investors just end up becoming the new 1%, and late adopters in less developed countries will remain if not end up more financially disadvantaged in the global economy.

TLDR: same problems with unregulated capitalism, different flavor"
The argument that I have heard is some people in the world have slow internet or pay per GB and it wouldn't be possible for them to run a full node. I'm not sure how true that is though.
It's not a pr issue, it's a practical issue. As it stands bitcoin is useless as a currency due to its volatility. It's essentially a speculative commodity at this point. Imagine how unsustainable it would be if the cash in your bank account could drop or increase in value 30% over a month at the whim of traders.
You're ignoring the cost of internet access. As well as the cost of storage. 
Why do you insist on setting us straight with the truth?  
"You cannot read the graph. I'm sorry for you.

I have not mentioned past months. I mentioned the past week."
"Perhaps you want to look again. https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx does not show any backlogged transactions above 40 satoshi/byte. Since they lump 20 to 40 together, you cannot see 30 there, but the graph I linked to shows it more precisely, including the recent backlog.

They also recommend higher transaction fees, which I had already mentioned. But that is because they want to stay on the safe side. De facto you only needed 30 satoshi/byte, i.e. some 20 cents for a simple transaction.

I never talk nonsense. (:-)"
"you can not be guaranteed to get into a block like that. Wait until the first time you get caught in the backlog, won't be so fun anymore as you wait to get your coins back until you can spend again. 

Then you'll realize we need bigger blocks. "
"I'd show you the transactions but we'll... Reddit ;-) Anyway you can take my word for it. "
[deleted]
">Why is it necessary to download the whole blockchain?
>
>And if you have 10 minutes to mine a block, what difference does it make if it takes a few seconds to download several megabytes of transactions? 

Blocks don't generate after exactly 10 minutes. The incentive is set for miners to be constantly looking for the next block. Having the full block downloaded and verified is a prerequisite to mining the next block. 

It's seems complicated because there is no centralized control. 

Basically there's a math problem to be solved in order to publish a legitimate block. The math problem has a certain difficulty level. The difficulty level is periodically set to match the global hashing (computing) power so that blocks come out about every 10 minutes. 

Sometimes blocks come out 45 seconds after the previous block. Sometimes it takes the entire world's hash power 19 minutes. 

The difficulty level generally goes up, but has on occasion gone down.  "
">Why aren't more miners appearing to handle these extra transactions

It is not a question of there not being enough miners. The problem is that the Bitcoin Software itself limits the amount of transactions to 1 megabyte every 10 minutes. There are only so many transactions you can fit into 1 megabyte of data, and the network is consistently at that limit, thus the big backlog of transactions."
There is a limit to the size of a block (1 megabyte). Difficulty also increases to make the time to process a block approximately 10 minutes.
Crypto doesn't rely on a bank to handle transactions though
I was joking but essentially what you said
Thats only because Paypal has first-mover advantage. They had over a decade to establish their business
Maybe they were given a cut of the ICO or premine of another semi popular crypto in exchange for their betrayal. Maybe the banks threw money at them? Why be a millionaire when you can be a billionaire by simply destroying the one you help operate?
"Who does Bitcoin threaten most? Their investments are not in Bitcoin, but in ""not-bitcoin."" 

When trillions are at stake, a few million spent to throw a stick into the spokes of an open source software team is chump change. "
"Who said they have a large investment in Bitcoin? Most of the Bitcoin ""core"" dev team doesn't own or use Bitcoin. They're employed or contracted by a company called Blockstream which got 76 million dollars from AXA. Bitcoin's success runs counter to their plans to push users to secondary protocol layers and sidechains. 

Not to mention that bitcoin could make banking businesses (trillions of dollars) obsolete. 76 million dollars to stall this eventuality and preserve the business model for a few more years sounds dirt cheap to me."
You would be stupid to buy into a bubble.
Hahaha no thank you 
"Where do you trade? I see some more available on Polo but not the ones I want
Add: with ETH. Looking for growth, not just a ""top ten."""
Tbh you could probably just use ethereum as an intermediary with other alts
Yeah except thats assuming Bitcoin is a perfect coin which only fuels Blockstream's power (or desire for it.) Fact if the matter is I don't need them or that coin, we have a free market of currency.
His demeanor, how he inserted himself onto a stage to sell us on something that can sell itself, the guy's like nails on a chalkboard.
probably because he's a disingenuous sell out
"He says one thing and does another. Slowly he's becoming a hypocrite. 

permissionless innovation - not allowed to innovate without Core's permission (AsicBoost.)

Banking for the unbanked - limit the number of transaction so they can't use the blockchain and are forced to use ""banks""

He pushes the BC/Core narrative for Segwit and ignores the downside. "
Not particularly knowledgeable here but I believe it has to do with the difficulty of hashing the next block in the chain.  With every new block the hash becomes more and more difficult and at this point, it's not a trivial or cheap thing to get into mining for profit whereas in the earlier days, just using idle CPU and GPU cycles was sufficient.
"We're in the middle of a very bitter war about how to upgrade bitcoin to make it scalable for the masses.

When it becomes usable again, you won't need anyone to convince you. Bitcoin is both a store of value and a mean to exchange it frictionlessly across borders. It's decentralised and trustless, so it's resistant to censorship by any third party, including governments. It's non-inflationary over the long term.

This is a revolution in money in the making. Right now it's far closer to a speculation asset, you're right, but it's these properties that are driving the speculation. The US legislature just repealed Dodd-Frank, how long do you expect we have again until the next global economic recession? And if the world continues inching towards the extreme right wing and totalitarianism, how free do you expect you'll be able to be with your money, in, say, 30 years?

Bitcoin didn't emerge or of thin air; like all inventions it's a response to the environment in which it was created."
"Right now, using my BTC and requirinig no ones permission or legal sanction, I could initiate a transfer of wealth to someone in a shithole (let's say 'Venezuela') which no government would be able to prevent and which would be complete in about 15 minutes for five bucks. 

There is tremendous value in that.  That you give that no credence, but instead go on about how gold is better because you can ""show it off"" is a common opinion amongst the unimaginative these days, and they will miss the ride to the moon those with vision who understand the potential for crypto are and will take as crypto gains market cap, gains acceptance, and gains  stability"
That's what happens when you base your entire country around a non renewable resource
"Right, and I agree with most of those sentiments about human nature and decentralization. My question is more ""is there a better alternative global currency and financial system that doesn't promote if not exponentially worsen the same ridiculous wealth inequality that we have today?""

These early adopters getting crypto rich aren't providing any real value to society that justifies their newfound wealth. Most of them are just gaming the markets with a mix of foresight, luck, and the inherent privilege of having internet access and spare investment money."
Cool, thanks for the clarification.  Been meaning to really read up on it but just haven't had time lately.
"It certainly would. This is why a simple blocksize increase is required, however there are heavily entrenched forces (Bitcoin ""core"")  at work who have a definite conflict of interest with Bitcoin functioning as intended, unfortunately. I am sad to report that so far they are succeeding in their bid to stall the progress and usability of Bitcoin."
Agree. This is in fact why we in rbtc have been advocating for removing the limit / making it a floating cap. If the cap floats, it's much harder to conduct this flood attack. 
"When the 1MB limit was introduced seven years ago, it was purposely placed high enough to be able to handle several thousand times the amount of median retail/consumer activity actually happening on the blockchain. It was never intended to be something that limits the amount of growth Bitcoin can experience. 

See here: http://gavinandresen.ninja/One-Dollar-Lulz"
"I certainly agree that the inherent flaws of capitalism are a symptom of fundamental human nature. Maybe it's overly optimistic to expect a more utilitarian system of resource distribution to be realistically possible and sustainable.

That being said, now more than ever mankind seems to be teetering on the verge of a transcendental/transhumanist evolution/revolution of sorts with the rapid advancement and adoption of internet, AI, and VR tech, global currency and culture forming online, and even the resurgence and legalization of therapeutic psychedelics. It might not be that unrealistically optimistic to expect the shackles of ""human nature"" to be unlocked, so to speak, within our lifetime.

Thanks to you as well for the quality discussion! "
Username checks out.
Ah ok. I didn't know that. Thanks stranger 
It has gone up tremendously since created, but still is nowhere near its potential. Less than 1% of the population is using bitcoin right now. If the scaling problems are solved (which is hopefully only a matter of time), transaction fees are reduced, and mainstream adoption occurs, bitcoin value could increase greatly. With a market cap of $2 trillion, 1 btc= $100k. I think that is possible. 
15 minutes vs who knows how long
Many places have bitcoin atms where you can trade cash for bitcoin and vice versa. There are also websites where you can buy and sell bitcoin using a credit card. Hopefully over time more merchants will take bitcoin directly. This is already common in places like Japan and online services like steam and VPN providers, but there’s a long way to go before it’s common in real life

"Yes... they read Satoshis white paper like some sort of religious manuscript.

But come on, how was that dude in 2007 (or group) supposed to know how things were going to be 10 years later!?

Bitcoin core are made of an exceptional group of coders... they have Bitcoins best interest at heart. "
Easy - each group is trying to fatten their wallets in the short term, but one implementation choice impedes the other in achieving that goal.  IMO, at least miners fattening their wallets means bitcoin is more secure.
"To be fair, the BS-core team has every incentive to paint the ""not-BS-core"" crowd as evil and ""against progress"" because it is far easier to demonize or dismiss an enemy, and far less reasonable to do the same to a ""group that has different opinions"". 

At the end of the day, it is the protocol which by design is fueled by the miners (see: original Satoshi whitepaper) which will decide the software implementation, despite the wishes of the BS-core team to retain their power as ""they who control the protocol."" Note that miners were not ever labelled as the enemy and stallers of progress until the Hong Kong agreement fell through and alternate protocols such as Classic, XT, and Unlimited started gaining traction via hash rate. Now miners are practically reviled in r/Bitcoin and viewed as greedy and sneaky with all those fees that aren't their fault and AsicBoost which is a total non-issue. Funny how that worked out..."
I just declared my assumption, because you don't know what you are talking about.  Mining nodes are needed to process the transactions and that consumes electricity. You are not running a mining node, and therefore you are not processing transactions...so what is your point exactly?
"Oh, how smart are you.

I see you edited your top comment. I'm glad I quoted the original line."
"No, it actually isn't. There is an inbuilt cost to including every byte in the block payload. This provides an automatic disincentive to bloat the chain. This is confirmed by the years of history before the limit was hit.

I have no idea how easy it is to exchange bitcoin in Venezuela specifically, but you’re probably right. All it takes is one local atm or one local market that accepts bitcoin though, which could very easily start to happen if people lose trust in the value of their local currency

Yeah. I've read the white paper and I've seen the antimining rhetoric far too often unfortunately. 
Pretty good point to be honest 
Something that lets people process more transactions for the same effort when the demand is high. I guess the hard part is defining how that would scale. 
Moneygram is instant... 
">Hopefully over time more merchants will take bitcoin directly.

Isn't the whole point of this thread that this will never happen as long as the transaction fees are so high?"
So the Venezuelan guy is still fucked?
I'm running a node on a 7 years old desktop, and it's slower than my laptop.
My i5 laptop can easily keep up with it.

I believe him. I paid the same too, three times within the last month when I transfered funds from coinbase to trezor. 
I'm so confused. Half the community says the miners stall progress. The other says core devs stall progress. Both have progressed Bitcoin, both have maintained Bitcoin, and both share responsibility in key technical choices. Why is everyone so convinced its us vs them?

I've read a bunch of stuff about people having problems with disappearing deposits and frozen withdrawals since the DoS like a month back? Are they actually functioning?
Oh wow that's shitty, sorry you got stuck in that. I came across a comment yesterday that mentioned it but quickly forgot - I haven't been trading alts recently, just sort of mouthwatering for them.
Bitcoin bad. Ethereum good.
I don't know why you're being downvoted. I think I was vaguely aware of it before Rogan, but on a (relatively) mainstream platform getting to hear someone talk about this new interesting thing for 2+ hours I'm sure got a lot of people interested. 
"He's done a lot of good. I've seen him in action and he's brilliant. But I can't ignore the what's happened. He's dependent on speaking fees and book sales and the book is full of BS/Core authority and the un-banked are not paying the speaking fees.

The Banking 2.0 Elites building new transaction networks on top of Bitcoin are the ones paying the new lobbyist. "
"Easy. You control the major dev team. This by itself is not enough; anyone could submit a new protocol proposal for the community to vet. So, you combine this with full mod control over the major Bitcoin discussion places. Bitcointalk forums, r/Bitcoin, etc. You use this control over the discussion places to censor any positive mention or neutral discussion over other protocol proposals. Establish your team as the ""one and only TRUE source of expertise"" and badmouth all others. No one can badmouth YOU because you can just ban or censor them. Over time, as the ""true believers"" leave in droves to other subs, or worse other protocols, you have created an ever more insulated bubble of group think that agrees with you. ""Core team is the only legit team. Anything that they don't agree with must be inferior and wrong.""

And thus we see that the weakest point of a decentralized protocol like Bitcoin is the users themselves. Through a clever and dastardly plan of social engineering and propaganda BS-core has gained a very tall soapbox to stand atop of, and an unfortunate amount of users (and shills) who look up to them and parrot their talking points. Even better, these talking points are so designed so as to make BS-core look like the good guys (""sure we want a ""size"" increase, that's what SegWit does!"") and make the rest of the proposals seeking a simple blocksize increase as Satoshi intended look like the bad guys (""Miners just want AsicBoost! Just want your fees! Bitcoin Unlimited is buggy and their team just wants power! Funded by the devil, Roger Ver!""). 

And that's where we stand. Bitcoin is unusable as it was intended to work as long as BS-core is at the helm. There is a growing movement to restore the protocol to functionality, but is it too late? Time will tell."
He was once a hero to me too. Then something​ happened to cause him to go back on the ideals of crypto and start shilling for a corrupt team that hopes to stall Bitcoin progress until it dies.
So why not explain how he is wrong then? 
Ok?  So why not give the correct answer to the question?
And yet you didn't explain what is incorrect...
Yes but it costs a lot of money and ends as soon as you run out. In the meantime all that money is a wealth transfer to the miners who can use the income to build out their infrastructure. So the attacker is literally paying Bitcoin to scale up against his attack. 
"Satoshi has most likely either died, gone off the grid completely, or is in some secret prison somewhere.

It's extremely likely that he/she has lost the private keys to those addresses, meaning there's nearly 3 billion dollars that nobody can ever touch.

Besides, people are watching those addresses. The second even a cent moves from one, the price of Bitcoin will tank, and they will no longer have 2.8 billion worth. It's lose/lose to even touch that money. They would have been better off starting an exchange, mining operation, or simply just buying additional Bitcoin over the years and using that profit instead."
">The dude that invented bitcoin is said to have mined about 1,000,000 coins. At $2,800/coin that's 2.8 billion dollars. Reminds me of a pyramid scheme. 

And those coins haven't moved. It's largely believed that at least 3 million coins have been permanently destroyed. If those coins ever move, you'll see a tank in the price of Bitcoin. 

I don't believe a person has the kind of self control to sit on 2.8 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin for over 6 years. Even at a tenth of the price three years ago, I wouldn't believe that someone has that much self control.  "
No, you got it. Its making the network more centralized. r/btc seem cool with it though. 
The community has been bamboozled into allowing a centralized development team to control the agenda. Rbitcoin is a big part of that. Other cryptos have learned from Bitcoin's mistake and chose to support competing dev groups to create a healthier, low-groupthink ecosystem. 
">you will not be processing any transactions

Why? You mean it is not powerful enough for 1MB per 10 minutes? 

It is, and most of the time idling."
I am running a full node on an Odroid XU4 and it uses 2 watts. What are you talking about?!
He got the mining process very well, the wrong part is that difficulty is readjusted not at every block, but after every 2016 blocks  that have been mined.
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6gek0z/average_bitcoin_transaction_fee_is_now_above_five/dipwkr6/
"For someone not knowledgeable in bitcoin mining, your answer was pretty close, and understandable. 

The mining difficulty re-adjusts every 2016 blocks, not every block. That's the only point I need to correct."
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6gek0z/average_bitcoin_transaction_fee_is_now_above_five/dipwkr6/
"> So the attacker is literally paying Bitcoin to scale up against his attack.

Except no scaling on the miner's part will overcome the 1MB/10m.  Unless, I guess, if they start to signal for larger blocks."
But it comes at the cost of retail usability during the attack. Meaning people trying to use bitcoin as consumers can't, and that might drive the overall interest in the currency down. 
"I'm not sure we'll ever find a better alternative, or that even if we did, we won't revert back to some level of long tail inequality eventually. This has been the norm throughout history. I feel unless there's some vastly transcendental experience far in the future, people will always be the people we've been throughout it. We'll trade, risk, lose, win as well as lie, cheat, coerce, censor, and wage war to achieve all of the previous.
                        
What Bitcoin does, perhaps for the first time in the history of any monetary system, is harness this inherent greed, so that as you serve your own self-interest, you serve the collective interest of the rest of the participants as well (imo). A speculator will short the highs and long the lows, bringing less volatility. A black hat hacker will eventually teach us better opsec at a cost, etc. The risks of the very early adopters (because I feel anyone getting involved now is still an early adopter), or the work they did in creating it, believing in this system, explaining its intricacies and evangelizing it to others or investing in mining (which in turn protects the whole network for a reward) is worth the potentially asymmetric reward. Maintaining the veracity of a potential global society's ledger, nurturing it from fragility into robustness, building its immune systems, and teaching it to others may be an activity built on many privileges, and perhaps some luck, but I feel its value is unquestionable.

Thanks for the great discussion, already very late here, hope I've helped clarify some elements!"
Nah, that's what happens when capitalists sabotage an economy.
I don't know dude.  Seems like Bitcoin's already been around the moon a few times.  How much further does it have to go?   For something that has a few glaring flaws why should it be worth so much?  Also the community around Bitcoin isn't all that great.
With the exception that gold is a physical object that you can barter with.  Bring your. It pins with you and try to travel the world and tell me how far you get when you reach a place with no internet.
There aren't many countries where the inflation is on Venezuelan level or anything near them. So there is no reason to switch from your local currency to BTC. Also, Venezuelans won't use BTC to buy their daily stuff because of the 5 dollar fee.
Ethereum does it cheaper and faster and the community is united in its scaling plans.
You can go to 7-11 and send a money gram for 3.95$ to Venezuela totaling $3003.95. Cheaper than bitcoin and no one can tell you when to go to bed or brush your teeth. 
Explain to my like I am five: How does that person in Venezuela go about turning that Bitcoin into cash they can go buy food with?
IF it becomes usable again.
Do you know why?
"Easiest way would you buy coins at your favorite exchange (for me coinbase).

Then send them to either poloniex or bitterex. From there you can exchange them to a bunch of different coins. I think Bitterex has near 100. Polo has like 20 big alts but I could be very wrong.

It's only a 0.25% fee per buy/sell. "
So that means that anyone with enough money can flood transactions increasing the cost of a transaction? Basically a denial of service attack?

at this point why even use bitcoin
I'm sorry, but I do not believe you. I tried sending with Electrum and Mycelium several times last few weeks, and they never recommended less that 0.0015 btc for next block confirmation. That's about $4.
I send small transactions on medium speed and it's still $3....
I've been paying lots of times recently and never payed more than 1.20 usd for speedy transactions.... 
People living on less than 10 dollars a day probably won't be using bitcoin to be honest. 
"You are talking nonsense. 

Transaction count always goes down over the weekend, but fee now is far away from 20 US cents. More like 80-100 US cents.

Just tried Electrum, normal tx, 1 input, 2 outputs, wallet recommends a 0.0017 fee for next block, 0.001 for 25th block confirmation. It over-estimates by 100%, but even this calculator doesn't show 20 US cents:

https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx

    The current best transaction fees 
    261 Satoshis/byte | 0.00261 BTC/KB "
"Have you even actually tried sending a transaction these last couple of months?

I've got 500-600 sats/byte tx fees and I need HOURS to even get a single confirmation.

Your 20 cents is the nonsense figure. You've drank so much of the Core/Blockstream Kool-Aid you're completely out of touch with reality.

"
"mempool is supposed to empty after every block.

https://bitcoinfees.github.io/

look at the 'tx byterate' line, that is the network capacity. The network is overloaded, 35x its capacity."
This is a total joke.  Satoshi's brilliant design allows miners to be compensated by built in value of appreciating price.  Is ~$36,000 every ~10 minutes (not even taking into account the much higher value if bitcoin succeeds) not enough?  
One thing that I find amusing is a lot of people on r/conspiracy hate the Federal reserve and fiat money but will immediately turn around and tell you to invest in BTC even though all crypto currencys are the end all of fiat currency. 
"If this question has been answered please link me to the thread...

Is there a possibility that BTC becomes a holding coin for smaller coins? As in trading a cheaper in bulk to both transfer value to an expensive coin while making the cheaper coin available on purpose? What would that do to the holding coin over time?"
Just so you know, the mempool was never intended to remain full, or half full, or even in necessary usage for extended periods of time at all. 
"> But, I guess people are getting rich for nothing but speculation and moving money around, so that's a thing

What is stocks?"
Instead of complaining, take actions: Move on to alt coins or just shut the fuck up. 
[deleted]
It's infuriating, I refuse to take part in anything related to bitcoin right now... no alt trading (😒) or anything. Wish we had another intermediary!!! !!!!
Hardfork it. Problem solved.
Back in March I made a transaction and it took forever. I used to make about one a month for a few hundred dollars with what I thought was the average fee. Never had a problem, it was handled within 30mins at most.  The one in March was when 1 btc = ~$700. Is this crowding of the transactions why that happened? 
"What a nonsense! Required fees have shrunk from 50 satoshi/byte to 30 satoshi/byte over the last couple of days.

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1w

You currently need a fee equivalent to 20 US cents to get a normal transaction confirmed. Of course it is wise to add a bit more, but those $5 are a nonsense figure.

Quite possibly some wallets calculate far too high fees, so it may not be the users' fault that they pay too much."
Noob Question : How do you buy alt coins directly? 
Can someone give me a quick rundown on how this all took place? I'm subscribed because I love cryptocurrency and I'm a hardcore libertarian but I'm missing out on a bunch of this. I have a rough understanding of Segwit, and I'm not sure if that's related to this. Can someone explain how these monstrous fees came into action in the first place?
It's called speculation.
If Transfers are so expensive then mining must be fairly profitable right now. I imagine that if mining were to continue to gain popularity we would see transaction fees go back down again.
I've never paid such a big fee. Never been over a dollar.
Awesome subreddit
"> Is there a possibility that BTC becomes a holding coin for smaller coins?

Why hold BTC when you can just use the smaller coins? It made sense with gold and silver because gold became so valuable that even a tiny amount was worth too much. You don't need to do that with bitcoin because its very divisible, currently up to 8 decimal places.

The thing with cryptocurrencies is that it is both a store of value and, very importantly, a medium of transfer. All things being equal, why would you hold a crypto that is harder to use?

> As in trading a cheaper in bulk to both transfer value to an expensive coin while making the cheaper coin available on purpose?

There is no reason for you to pay to convert the cheaper coin to the expensive coin, pay some more to send the expensive coin, and pay again to convert back to the cheaper coin. Just use the cheaper coin to begin with. As more people realize this, the value of the cheaper coin will grow as more people buy it and eventually eclipse the expensive coin.

> What would that do to the holding coin over time?

Right now, bitcoin has the network effect by being first. Like mySpace. You use it because everyone else is. But bitcoin is becoming slow and tedious to use because upgrades aren't happening like mySpace. At some point, enough people get fed up and switch to a different crypto like how people moved to facebook.

That's why I don't think the logic of bitcoin being digital gold makes any sense."
Bitcoin is slow, expensive, and unreliable. I moved on, but always fun to come back and read the whining.
Why don't these people just use Alt coins?

Though, transaction times and fees make my dog slowly start looking for alternatives and a lot dark market vendors already accept alternatives. But it will take time until more people transition and until then I guess it's still a good investment

"> Electricity for a full node can cost around $2 per day

"Bitcoin, right now, is worth less (by market cap) than PayPal.  

If you don't think Bitcoin has greater potential than frickin' PayPal, and has the potential to offer tremendously more value to the consumer, we have nothing further to discuss.  

PayPal won't let you do transactions they don't like for moral reasons.  Want to buy eCigs with PayPal?  So sorry, no can do.  Are you behind the Great Firewall of China and want to  use a VPN and transact with PayPal?  Forget about it... there will be no evading the dictates of the Chinese government using PayPal.   Want to use PayPal to contribute to a cause they don't like (for any reason, or no goddamn reason at all)?  Nope... not on PayPal, buddy.   Are you a retailer, and want to add PayPal's commission to the price of what you have sold?  Nope.  Forget about it.  You as a seller have to swallow PayPal's load and cannot cost out their charges, even if the buyer thinks that would be fine.

 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies require no ones permission, and requires no ones trust.  They requrire no license or permission from any government.  They require following no corporate rules... the only rules are those the individual traders decide is best for them.  The potential upside to that change in paradigm, and the freedom to transact business as the traders wish, and not as governments and corporations wish, is immense. As a form of ""digital gold"" and as a storehouse and transport for wealth the upside is huge and will leave the PayPals of the internet eating their dust.  

"
Well bitcoins isn't going anywhere after all. 
"Wasn't cryptocurrency about removing banks and their fees from the equation and making the exchange fast, free and anonymous?! This should have been made illegal from the beginning.

So, congratulations, you played yourselves. Rule of Acquisition 10: Greed is eternal."
">That's why I don't think the logic of bitcoin being digital gold makes any sense.

Some argue that it is not exactly as myspace->facebook. Creating a new account at facebook is easy, doesn't cost anything, except time to build your new profile. With bitcoin, there is financial involvement, and people are more reluctant to switch. I don't agree, there are now many sites (digital exchanges) where one can very easy switch from bitcoin to other coins, and many are doing it right now."
wtf, I thought one of the main points was no transaction fees
how are small secretive groups of unelected people making arbitrary decisions on block size ANY different to traditional banks and reserve currency trading? Yes secrecy is good (and its how i get goodies ) but lets not delude ourselves shall we? Humans are in charge of btc and humans are shitty and greedy.
"The mean transaction fee really doesn't seem like a reasonable figure to report on. It is biased high by large transactions.

You should go with the median transaction fee."
How dare you throw the truth in our face! Reported. See you in ban land.
"DM;GFB"
Why not just take down the major pools for a few weeks to set things straight? No one wants a user based civil war, it will essentially set BTC back years. Fuck with their transaction fee income and maybe they will stop ruining btc.
"Bitcoin has the promise of being upgradeable, censorship resistant, and immune to capture. 

What you are watching is an attempt by a special interest group to block upgrades, censor small transactions, and capture the tech. This is Bitcoin's trial by fire. If it succeeds, anyone holding Bitcoin will be amazingly rich.

"Bitcoin is above capacity, which means that all new transactions can not be processed within the first 10 minutes anymore. The miners, who do the processing, can choose which transactions they will include in the next transaction block. They also receive the transaction fees of the chosen transactions. Miners, therefore, choose to prioritize the transactions with a high fee included. This results in people including a higher and higher fee to outcompete the rest for the probability of having the transaction completed as soon as possible. If you do not include any fee, your transaction may never be included because there are transactions with fees coming in all the time.

An option is to increase the size of the Bitcoin transaction blocks themselves, and thereby increasing the number of transactions that may be processed. However, the community is not agreeing on what to do. Increasing the size requires people to have better internet connections, and bigger hard drives to store the blockchain."
"There is a transaction fee that goes to people who put their systems on the network to process transactions, in order to incentivize people to contribute their processing power to the system. 

This used to be a negligible fee that you would barely notice, but it has increased to the point that transaction costs make Bitcoin impractical for normal exchanges."

I don't know, you tell me?
"I just can't wait to see the shop windows with 50 different stickers on them showing which crypto currencies they accept, and the little atm in the corner that lets people exchange crypto currency A with crypto currency B, for a small fee of course. 

Or how about the gigantic businesses that will need to be created to handle all of the transactions and makes sure they go through quickly and efficiently. We'll call them banks. "
"Avg. Transaction Fee Bitcoin - $ 4.54 

Avg. Transaction Fee Ethereum - $ 0.83   

Median Transaction Fee Ethereum - $0.12

Avg. Transaction Fee Litecoin - $ 0.16

- will be more affordable with atomic swaps.*

*edited for accuracy.


IMHO these are all too expensive for many developing countries but it does show the ETH and LTC at least have a chance of being affordable in some, while BTC in its current form does not. :("

Not that he changes his mind by becoming more educated, it's that he was probably compensated to push broken BSCore roadmap. Don't listen to me, listen to some of his earlier speeches. All the main selling points of Bitcoin he promoted in 2015 are gone. Still keeps using the same selling points that once were valid, lying to his crowds. As if he were a speaker for OneCoin seminar, bumping a pyramid scheme. Other topics of his speeches in 2017 include labeling initiatives to increase block size ""attacks on bitcoin"", and insulting competitive alt coins that have better development road maps."

"Also, running a full node costs far less than 5 USD per day in terms of bandwidth and electricity costs. So their ""but everyone needs to be able to afford running their own full node"" argument has been ridiculous for quite some time now."
This was predictable. The amount of processing to perform a transaction goes up over time based on the way bitcoin works. The cost of computer processing these days is mostly energy - to power and cool the computers. Basically, computation is a heater and a cooler fighting each other. And bitcoin is computationally intensive and will get more so. Some advances in tech have increased efficiency, but not as fast as the requirements of bitcoin.
Thanks! Edited.
This is what does it for me. The whole system already has just as many, or more problems than the current one. But, I guess people are getting rich for nothing but speculation and moving money around, so that's a thing. 
"But you can buy a lot more shit with money on paypal, maybe one in ten companies I use let's you buy things from bitcoins, there's also a huge transaction fee.

Why didn't they implement the fee as a percentage of the transaction? $5 is a reasonable fee on $5000 transaction.
5 bucks gets you 3 days to confirm, 10 bucks minimum if you needs it now
[deleted]
Why aren't more miners appearing to handle these extra transactions and push the price back down closer to the cost of mining?
Transactions used to be prioritized on more than just fee.  Time and age of coins mattered too.  Thank core from removing that important feature too.
Increasing the block size is going to be necessary if we want more adoption, especially in poorer countries where bitcoin would actually benefit the people. 
It is like banking, but worst
 Curious, why do you not like Andreas? 
But with Ethereum you can still get your transaction mined in a few minutes for 1 cent USD.
I agree with you but /u/nullc claims that this model will fail in a few short years. I'm sure he will share his research on this since apparently he knows what Bitcoin will be worth in the future. 
"Actually bitcoin needs the people who want the original vision to take part in preserving it.

You don't have to use bitcoin to trade alts at this point.
Litecoin is the same thing, but bigger block sizes and has Segwit already. We're an optimistic, but welcoming community. :)

Very appropriate. In fact, I have seen a lot of (justifiably) negative posts regarding exchanges lately where this probably applies.
Is there more to the Chinese? That character can be a name, but alone it can also just mean *yuan* the currency, basically a $ sign. Which is slightly unusual.
Just ignore the people saying don't store money on an exchange.  They are technically right but you can't fix that now.  If they don't get you your coins back the best thing you can do is a PR blitz to their users that this is an unsafe exchange to use.  If they even think that they might lose their exchange over the issue you might just get your coins back.  These exchanges all live and die on their reputations and if that becomes compromised they seriously can lose millions.
Sounds like a possible glitch in their website's code where your database row got overwritten with the information of another user.
