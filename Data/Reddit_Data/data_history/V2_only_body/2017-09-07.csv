I didn't understand what you were saying until I realized you meant r/noncensored_bitcoin. Was there a reason you didn't link to it?
You're the guy who bought some beers for 100k in 2017
"
It is not.. 
"
"I think there's a lot of times in my life where if someone asked me, ""Do you want a burger now or $2k in 4 years?"" that I'd choose the burger."
Smart play. I sent an ETH to my Dad a few months ago to show him how easy crypto is, and immediately bought 2 more.
Obviously you have to set up an account with bitcoin.com? My account is on another platform. Does bitcoin.com recognize other accounts or how does that work?
Enlighten me then senpai, what is the reason?
Well afaik it's not a legal payment - otherwise wouldn't there be more merchants and also big companies accept it as payment method?
I feel like everyday we are making this choice knowing the potential of crypto and choosing to get drinks and or burgers to enjoy the now. There is something to be said for living in the now just... live responsibly. lol
But where do you draw your line? Maybe it's $2k in 4 years but what if its $10k in 7 years?
No, they receive via a qr code. OP is saying he personally uses the b.com wallet.
They became slow because they got so much new users so fast and didn't got time to scale appropriately. Of course this sucks right now but on the other side they have a very good history and were the first to release BCH to their users. The API works great during low congestion times but is a nightmare during high congestion as I experienced it too. That's why I also opened an account on bittrex (the process was done in under an hour) because their api is pretty fast & reliable and you can buy BCH from BTC
Its considered barter.. And companies are more than legally permitted to barter. 
 That line is very much dependent on how hungry I am at the time. 
"The money he saved on transaction fees pays for itself in free drinks.

Literally."
Ok so my wallet would have its own reader of the qr code. Presumably. New to this. Sorry about the dumb questions.
Even with the true history of Tienanmen Square written in the blockchain? If you run a full node there, you have ownership of censored material. 
well ok so why does no big company accept it then? they did in 2013 like baidu afair
Wise choosing of reasoning. I feel the same.
Also important is which burger shop is the burger coming from? I mean, if I was hungry enough, 2k for a double double, I could see it happening. But 2k for 5 guys? Sounds like a porn title, and their burgers taste like one too.
"Yes, most mobile wallets have their own qr readers.

No worries, this is what forums are for. Bitcoin is a complex system to get your head around."

that doesnt stop big companies in neighboring Japan
[deleted]
Sure but it still stops the users who would actually want to transact in BTC. Japan is excited about Bitcoin, no doubt, they want it to succeed, doesn't change the fact that no one is going to pay a $3 fee to buy a $8 meal, still useful for bigger purchases though I suppose. 
Should i be the heretic suggesting that Jesus doesn't cut it and it's Japan's move to recognize Bitcoin as legal payment? Maybe I shouldn't.
well there are big companies in japan taht offer btc payments and NONE in china. fees wouldnt suffice as reason.
so why didn't they accept bitcoin in 2013 or 2014 or 2015 before fees got prohibitively expensive? hint: the legality of it is very much in question as the statement made by the chinese gov in 2013 was intentionally very vague. 
I'm not arguing with that, but the fact that the whole thing doesn't work most of the time (at least for me) sucks. And their UI, compared to others, it's also not the best one.
Kraken
Except Kraken is so fucking slow and API calls fail constantly.
japan fully legalized btc, china allows mining, trading, but doesnt want to see payments within its borders.
At least you know you're not paying with something that is going to be worth twice next year. So it's better that way, in a way.
None, Jihan does all the transaction processing for them.
I need tacos for some reason now.
Which are the best BCC exchanges to buy it?
How did they accept the Bitcoin Cash?
"How many Chinese girls does it take to process a BCC transaction ?

There's a joke there somewhere...."
"This is just proof we've been going about this all wrong! *Coffee* isn't Bitcoin's killer app. Coffee is boring.

Now **beer** is where it's at! Beer will motivate the masses!"
You mean you are not actually using it to buy coffees?
wow nice. but i think officially it is illegal to offer bitcoin payments
"Use it. Then replace it!!!!

PS - speaking from experience as someone who bought a burger and beers with btc in 2013

PPS - just did some rough calculations - that meal cost me almost $2000 (assuming hodling instead)."
"Did you wait 10 minutes for the transaction processment to take effect? Not enough gas! 
(pun intended) "
What are the mechanics of this?
I'm disappointed the B logo isn't the proper BCH one lol
If everybody uses bch as long term investment tool than its going to take longer to get us to that year
[deleted]
Just send from Bitcoin.com wallet to QR code
I'll let them know
Who's face is that in the O?
Taco shop owner. He's a Bitcoiner
In all seriousness, we shouldn't discourage people from actually using cryptocurrency. A the end of the day, a crypto is only as valuable as it is used.
You need tacos.
BeerCoinCash ftw !
"Holy shit, even *you* were banned? You're one of the most reasonable and level-headed posters I've ever come across. Can't say I'm surprised.  At least I got some satisfaction for my banning when I suggested to crazy Luke that bitcoin is set up to severely punish those who break consensus. He didn't like that. Looks like r/bitcoin is entering the hallucinogenic third act of ""Apocalypse Now."" Starring Adam Back as Kurtz.  "
"Holy hell, my friend, your Apocalypse Now reference is golden! LOL!

Thank you for the kind words, as well!

Given my open support for SegWit2x, I can't say that I'm at all surprised by my ban... those guys are just seriously beyond all hope and reason at this point.

I'd like to think that karma and Darwinism will handle it from here. :)"
And 25m more a few hours ago.
"If the market cap is $150 billion, I don't think it's that crazy to have less than 1/500th that in tether. During last weekend's NEO news, I sold all crypto for tether. I held onto it for a few hours and bought back in when prices were low. 

Don't think of it as 1/500th of people are holding tether. It's people using tether 1/500th of the time"
