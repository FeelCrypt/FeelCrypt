"Geographical distributiuon is why the partition is possible.
I don`t really know what the effective bandwidth of the BItcoin network across the greatfirewall is though.
In an emergency, you could presumably use a modem link. But then somebody (the miner presumably) would be paying long-distance charges across the pacific."

Solutions will be like  https://www.rt.com/viral/383321-kim-dotcom-megaupload-bitcache/
No segqit no block size increase needed!
fees will not matter since BTC will be used as store of value... MU 2.0 will start in august.
if you want to transfer from btc to LTC to pay and change from LTC to BTC to store thatwill be solved , like shapeshift does now...
so YES bitcoin is fine.  https://bitcoinfees.21.co/
M.U basicly does segwit w/o a update , it will write multiple transaction back in batch like exchanges do no creating high miner fees :)
It the moment you stay off chain and change to a other coin. you can limit on chain transactions very well.

"> https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ M.U basicly does segwit w/o a update 

segwit proponents should switch to that."
"> Its not aboiut small and b blocks , if BTC is unchageble and IN REVERSIBLE that makes it the best as a store of value. 

if Bitcoin was unchangeable people would not be pushing Segwit. 

Its about the transaction limit. be skeptical of people who insist the 1MB limit must stay. 

>yes it will be high fees 

yes until teh limit is removed, high fees make bitcoin less fungible, add transaction friction and centralizes control and ownership. 

there is no inventive to enforce higher fees with an artificial limit. "
I agree
Thanks but unfortunately I have neither the time nor the inclination to spend the next 90 minutes watching Andreas Antonopolous YouTube videos. Can you engage with my argument yourself and explain (even briefly) what errors I've made in my analysis?
"There's no such thing as a ""store of value"" whose utility exists separate and apart from its use as a medium of exchange.

Also see this post which outlines several ways that an arbitrary capacity limit is doing serious (and ever-increasing) harm to Bitcoin.
