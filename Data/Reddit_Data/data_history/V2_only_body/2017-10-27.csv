Like all assets, present value is based on discounted expected future value. The market isn't pricing bitcoin based on how it's performing today (if it was the price would be in the toilet). Instead it's based on expectations about the future. And we know what happens when things fail to live up to expectations. "

I was seeking a source for that James Forgan quote.  Do you know one?
"Agreed. What's been unique about bitcoin was actually how difficult it was for them to setup rent-seeking, and how easily it has been for us who were not bamboozled to 'route around damage' created by Blockstream by forking off BCC and the like.

In most software projects, they would've had no trouble doing this sort of thing. But bitcoin as a protocol is more resistant to this kind of dev-capture tactic, and it is by no means certain that it will work for Blockstream long-term.

These days, most corruption comes in the form of 'if you do X you'll be rich.' And Blockstream devs are just proving the rule. To think all they've put the community through was for anything except to try to make themselves millionaires is a grave mistake. They were willing to sell out everything that made bitcoin bitcoin, in order to become rich themselves, to rent-seek on their control of the main repo.

He may be talented, he may be highly skilled, but he is the sort of person that should never be in charge of anything. Employed for his talent and skill, sure, but in charge? God no. 

The great thing about the internet is history is saved in perpetuity. Greg's posted under his real name or under identified aliases for a long time.

Core, by making the network more stable and reducing the barrier to entry to run your own node and claim full autonomy over a new form of money, and in-so-doing making the network more robust against attack and regulation, are the rent seekers, and the people who want to increase the barrier to entry are the ones distributing regulatory power to the end-user?

In many market-driven economies rent-seeking exists regardless of the harm it may do to an economy.  Unless there is bribery or corruption rent-seeking is not illegal.  Core's rent-seeking is enabled by others.  When miners use Core they give political power and create a moral hazard.

"> reducing the barrier to entry to run your own node 

You don't need to run your own node. Nobody has ever been defrauded by using an spv wallet. Full nodes really only serve one purpose ― to disincentive any miner collusion. That's it. But average users don't need to run them to get the desired effect. Large transactions creators (think businesses) are probably sufficient for the purpose. 

> and in-so-doing making the network more robust

The utility of the network is falling day by day. Bitcoin has even lost its original use case of darknet purchases. They all prefer monero now. The more fees rise and the more unpredictable confirmation times become, the more people switch to alternatives. 

As I write this I'm waiting over 3 hours now for a purchase I made on OpenBazaar to confirm. I paid $1.62 fee. This is a horrible UX and almost certainly you'll be adding OpenBazaar to the list of apps that have dropped bitcoin if there aren't fundamental changes.

">     It is bloat because it is being subsidized.

> How?

Segwit makes signature data cheaper. That means the network is subsidizing Segwit transactions. Since the data still needs to be stored and transmitted it should cost the same as other transactions.

>     If you simply increased the blocksize users could still submit transactions with signatures that size but pay per byte like everyone else.
> 
> That would then be a hardfork, not a softfork.

So? Every other coin has managed to do safe hard forks. There is no evidence that there is any problems with them.

>     How would you prevent the bloat in future hard forks?
> 
> The weight of witness and non-witness (""Bloat"") data can be adjusted.

This does not remove the bloat. Every blocksize increase still can store additional bloat. Also the idea of developers becoming central planners is highly concerning. These decisions should be hard coded not decided arbitrarily. This is one of the biggest criticisms to Segwit.

>     What is the point of running a node if you are not verifying signatures?

No it's not. If we are throwing out witness data then we are unable to prove that anyone paid us. This is highly concerning.

It is bloat because it is being subsidized. If you simply increased the blocksize users could still submit transactions with signatures that size but pay per byte like everyone else.

How would you prevent the bloat in future hard forks? Are you suggesting we limit the number of Segwit transactions per block, or remove Segwit altogether? Those, as far as I can tell, would be the only way to prevent that bloat from being increased with every blocksize increase.

>     Segwit allows a blockweight of 4 megs. That is 4 megabytes that needs to be stored and transmitted.

"He's mining blocks back to back, minutes apart with the second one empty (removing the excuse that it could be due to propagation delay, although incompetence in the operation is still possible).

More damning, his pool regularly pushes out blocks that have transactions out of fee order, unlike all the other pools that don't have access to his patented covert asicboost features explicitly built into the hardware he sells.

At this point there are two possibilities. Either he is activating covert asicboost and profiting from 20% higher throughout, leaving evidence in the blocks he's mining. Or he's intentionally simulating the use of the asicboost he's admitted to building into his Asics -- making everyone believe he's activating asicboost, but without profiting from the 20% increase in earnings.

Which do you think is more likely? He's intentionally reproducing the external signs of asicboost use without profiting from it, or he's running asicboost which creates the evidence -- empty blocks far above the rate of other pools and weirdly ordered transactions that are known to be a sign of asicboost?"

My argument is setting a precedent where a handful of businesses can dictate a change to the code without widespread community consensus is a dangerous trend, be it related to block size or otherwise. In regard specifically to the block size debate, I do think a push for an increased size now at the behest of business interests will ultimately normalize the practice, and lead to further block size increase demands, and those later increases could lead to an ecosystem where centralization is unavoidable due to the capital costs associated with data storage and bandwidth.

Conflicts of interest everywhere.

Say we roll out these GB blocks people are talking about, that would literally have the potential to more than double the current blockchain size in a single day (current size 138gb vs max potential of 144gb). That would absolutely lead to needing business type solutions and hardware.

"First, ""core"" is a group of independent developers. If you meant blockstream, then yes, kind of like that. The difference in my view is that blockstream is attempting to provide a technical service to companies entering the crypto space for a fee, where as banks traditionally limit access, then charge users fees to act as authority figures with access. One is providing a service to companies for a fee, where as the other has traditionally inserted figurative roadblocks for the purpose of charging tolls.

Also, the blockstream solution doesn't preclude the option of on chain transactions separate from their payment channels, where as centralization through blocksize increase ultimately effects every single user. Having the option of a cheaper, but centralized payment channel tx or a more costly but decentralized on chain transactions is better than a one size fits all solution in my opinion. 2MB blocks obviously won't lead to centralization, but people in this sub are already talking about the recent testing of GB blocks, which absolutely will price out individual users and lead to corporate centralization.

So both sides have some negative aspects, but the Core plan seems like the lesser of two evils."
Yeah sure but I don't think twitter care about internal bitcoin bittering. 
"Because it's a digital currency that fills a massive void for online purchases and holding money without being limited to the rules and regulations of banks.

I swear some people here figured out how to craft a mobius strip, that's how deep the conspiracies go.
"> Are you trying to group DCG and Blockstream together? Because my understanding is that DCG supports 2X, while Blockstream supports 1X.

DCG is a Blockstream investor.  Perhaps there is a serious disagreement among them, or perhaps they're playing good cop/bad cop."
So you’re selling all you bitcoin and buying BCH because you are smarter than the market?
I encourage people to check out that link and read it for themselves. This is solid evidence of how low you're willing to go to deceive people. Might as well [link to it in context](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/75isx4/psa_the_amount_of_trolls_in_this_sub_has_spiked/do6t4r1/?context=3) to see how obvious it was that I was being sarcastic. 
"Agree with you 100%.  I know some claim BCH to be the original Bitcoin, I don't.  I do believe it to be Satoshi's original vision, but it is very likely to always be BCH and BTC to have a separate ticker.

1x should lose the BTC ticker within 24 hours of the fork if it is the chain with the lowest accumulated proof of work."
"> A better analogy would be that the 6 lane is congested, and instead of expanding it, they create a toll road.

The toll road is not ready for another 18 months, so now everyone just sits and waits in traffic, causing a huge loss in productivity. 

"
" You can't claim to be the real original bitcoin and be just a few months old. That's nonsense.. are all changes to the protocol brand new? Is segwit 1x brand new. When the 2x fork happens and 1x has 1 transaction per block will you say,  ""just give it time"" or will you possibly consider maybe that's an indication of a lack of support "
Stop moving the goalposts.
"really? Seems like you indicated you had multiple accounts there. And then when I think about the fact that sometimes when I argue with you (only you) I seem to get an unusual number of downvotes while you get an unusual number of upvotes, it begins to make sense.

"> Outed as a bankster shill.

What in the actual F... are you talking about?

> Miners make the decisions because they are the only ones whose survival depends solely on the success of the chain they're mining.

I think at this point it is fair to say many stakeholders apart from miners depend on Bitcoin success for survival.

> Yes, very interesting how independent businesses and miners are able to come together and offer the best possible user experience in order to expand their market base. This is exactly how it should be, not a group of officials deciding what's best for everyone while making sure they get their cut.

Well, on the other side you have the guys that sustain that the most important feature of Bitcoin is decentralization and big blocks can hurt it.

However, this deviates from the original point, I keep reading opinions but I hope to see HARD EVIDENCE or at the very least a detailed description of how Jihan knew about the plot he is accusing /u/adam3us of."
"I'm confused by that last line. Are you trying to group DCG and Blockstream together? Because my understanding is that DCG supports 2X, while Blockstream supports 1X. 

I personally think there are good people with good intentions on both sides, especially people like Barry and Erik who seemingly proposed 2X as a way to end the scaling stalemate, however, I think those promoting the idea of ""ousting Core"" are either knowingly or unwittingly part of a take over attempt by those who would like to see centralization of authority and centralization of the network. People like Larry Summers and Blythe Masters aren't interested in Bitcoin or it's users, they're just interested in how they can profit from it, and creating barriers to entry and central figures of authority like they have in banking is their modus operandi."
A better analogy would be that the 6 lane is congested, and instead of expanding it, they create a toll road. The 6 lane option still exists, but an additional option is provided with different costs/benefits. Where as the 2X solution expands the lane. Then does it again. Then again. Eventually it is expanded to the point where maintaining it is so expensive, they decide it needs to be a toll road, and now a toll road is the only option. This is what block sizes that price out individual users ultimately leads to.
I wouldnt really call it an agreement when they didnt agree to the terms (or have any say in what those terms were)
"Correct me if I'm wrong. It was my understanding that segwit was initially proposed as a security enhancement. The fact that by using it you can add more transactions per block is a nice-to-have side effect. 

As for why the current 2x proposal hasn't reached consensus, it's because a lot of people feel the cons outweigh the pros in simply raising the block size limit. The fact that it makes it harder for regular users to run their own nodes, therefore pushing for more centralization of what is essentially meant to be a decentralized platform."
segwit was activated because it reached consensus, 2x has not.
What do you mean the rest of the original team? Wladimir and Pieter have been the two largest contributors since like 2011. While you'll probably disagree with this, I'd say segwit activation was a significant accomplishment in allowing the community to move forward (all factions, including those who don't like segwit and now have BCH). Also, maintaining a working system during a rapid phase of adoption is an accomplishment. Not fucking stuff up is a pretty big accomplishment when you're talking about billions of dollars imo.
Oh so you're an idiot. My mistake
That's some industrial tinfoil
This is getting ridiculous. Jihan is starting to use Trump tactics and these starry eyed lap dogs think this is good for them and BCH when all I see is him acting out of desperation. We know bitmain is holding tons of BCH is will do anything to gain control. They have the most motive to promote their own coin and do everything they can to make the real bitcoin look bad by pushing some nonsense narrative over and over and over.  
"> Neither is Public debt as percentage of GDP a good measure of authoritative leadership.

Nice strawman, that's irrelevant and I didn't say that ...

It is a good measure of the risk Bitcoin poses to the respective money system."
Yes. 
No, I can't provide evidence for that, I am just letting you know I made that observation multiple times. 
Stop trolling.  You are welcome here, but be cool.
You know what?  Many Chinese people think bitcoin is American's attempt to trap the economy of other countries! 😂
"Holy fuck, I actually DO have evidence of this!

Yeah and people like you and Jihan are a reason why we cannot move forward and implement basic humanity in our daily lives. If you think Bitcoin is only market and capitalists tool, you missed the whole point of it. 
Yea, he should take care of himself. He should play his hands more wisely. I prefer the silent players to be honest.

You are looking at a guy who is fighting for his profits and yet you glorify it like he cares for a bigger cause or something. What a hell?

"Huh?! Him profiting from Bitcoin is him being *very well aligned with its success*.

This is how and why this whole beast *works at all*!"
People like you and Adam Back think Bitcoin is a socialist endeavor, it is not. It is as capitalist and free market as it gets.
As much as I disagree with Adam on various things, he's not wrong that Bitcoin Cash is far more centralized than Bitcoin. The more POW on a coin the more secure it is. The [BCH hashrate distribution chart isn't very pretty looking](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks) in contrast to the [BTC hashrate distribution.](https://coin.dance/blocks) It may very well be a fair assertion to so that most of that unknown hashrate on BCH is from Bitmain.
Lol weak ass pathetic troll with vote manipulation.
Jihan, me and some of my rich friends want new bitcoin with block reward of 100BTC  every 10 minutes. We are tired of only 12.5, OK? If more block reward, with $5000 bitcoin we be so much richer, yes? We pay you $20 billion USD, you have developer change code, then use all powerful hash rate and your mining nodes  to make this change for us, OK? Exchanges must follow since they follow most work, they must must must follow it has been divinely ordered. You good man Jihan. Hash rate rules, Satoshi say so if you look really really hard at white paper!!!  $20 billion check on the way to you!!!  :)
"And Jihan Wu knows about these bank orders... how exactly?

Why are we pro Jihan Wu around here? I don't get it."

He is rich as fuck, why would you worry about his safety too much. 
If he’s right why is BCH trading at like 5% of bitcoin?

it's like i never heard that before. "
I always vote down links to Twitter.  Forget Twitter. Disintermediate Twitter.   Support an alternative that pays users Bitcoin Cash micropayments instead of generating profit for that crap web site.

What a stupid thing to say. Blockstream is all about capital gains and to smaller extent sidechains.
"This sound just like Andrew Clifford a few years ago. Look how wrong he was. That dip was the bottom and bitcoin has gone up 20x since then. Basically Jihan and Andrew are all the same, they appeal to peoples emotion to try and get a following. Its got nothing to do with bitcoin.

"Literally two posts down from this one rn.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/791ks0/blockstream_leader_admits_that_they_are_crippling/

Blockstream is funded by AXA, a Bilderberg company with its tentacles entrenched in every corner of our financial system.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GsvuAXWdcMDft9qtq_6ptY3ZZq-3CXL6OelnlikNso

This paper, created before the BCH fork, outlines exactly what they're trying to do. Cripple Bitcoin's main chain so they can sell solutions like LN which their banker buddies can exploit to extract rent from the system, and Liquid which allows them to centrally lease block space. Both of these systems will control miner profitability and ensure Blockstream gains more control of the system over time.

They've already lost, the existence of Bitcoin Cash means they don't control the infrastructure they way they were counting on and now even the users are waking up to their deception, censorship, and otherwise toxic behavior. Unfortunately there's still plenty of people with a lot to lose if they succeed in breaking consensus and splitting the BTC network in two with their desperate ploy to keep SegWit1X functioning."
Attaboy Wu!
"> Yes, fuck the developers that have contributed to Bitcoin for years

Yup, exactly what I think too. Look at the history and it appears plainly.
"What's wrong with hardforking with a few days notice? (It wasn't random by the way, the hard fork was on the roadmap for ~3 years). The argument that you need a year to prepare for a hard fork isn't supported by real world evidence.

The privacy is no worse/no better than Bitcoin. Both are easily trackable by chain analysis. But ETH has zk-snark capabilities now. checksums should be a wallet feature, and your comment about EF-influenced miners is unfounded as well!"
"No, I dont work for NSA. I live in Scandinavia.
