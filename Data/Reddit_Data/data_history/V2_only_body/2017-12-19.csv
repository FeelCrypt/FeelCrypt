"The mad king was the father of Daenerys and Viserys. When Jon first meets her in Dragonstone Daenerys says, ""Don't judge me by my father"", or something to that effect. She was talking about the mad king. So actually then we are both wrong and they are half brother and sister.

The show itself spoiled it when they told the story of Ned's sister in parallel with Jon Snows story, whilst painting Ned Stark as pretty much the most honorable man in the realm and a devoted husband and father. Bran's 3 eyed raven arc just confirmed it."
Centralized in each possible sense. Who holds majority of coins. for example?
That does not make it a bad investment. It is a product that solves a problem. One with huge amounts of money involved at that. 
It's a negative because they've tried to ride on Bitcoin's coattails since 2013, even though they aren't really a related system. Also, they bought out the system from its inventor Ryan Fugger and added an unnecessary token.
"Its a centralized banking product, which is fine, demand is demand for certain products which they are providing to customers who want it. They're hardly the first tech startup for fiat banking tech.

Selling it as a *cryptocurrency* is what I take issue with. Its a centralized token, and I do make a distinction there between this and a real *cryptocurrency* as a decentralized distributed consensus ledger. 

You can run a validator node, but Ripple Labs still owns most of the XRP supply and is still functionally centralized around their private banking products."
"CMC lists BitConnect at 29th because all they need is an exchange API to list coins and they completely ignore that ~93% of all the supposed trading volume is coming from BCC's own centralized exchange which only deals with BCC. That exchange could report any number for the price and volume through their API and nobody would know better since trades are not on the blockchain, only deposits and withdraws are. They can and almost certainly are controlling the price of BCC but people trust CMC so they don't question the numbers.

So CMC in that regard is a complete joke."

It would make more sense to make it a Saas type centralized app
Cos it isn't a crypto, it's a bridge between two systems of money
Ripple was designed by Ryan Fugger in 2004. Ripple Labs (then called OpenCoin) just bought the idea from him in 2012 and added a huge premine of a token that wasn't even needed for the system to work. They did it solely to capitalize on the blockchain craze as 2013 rolled around, and have apparently lived on the strength of their great marketing department and political connections ever since. Unless I have missed some developments, Ripple is basically a go-nowhere project that takes advantage of financial executives and regulators who know nothing about crypto. They're like the competitor who has a bullshit product and can't compete but hangs in there by lobbying government and marketing like crazy.
"These aren’t necessarily negatives. From what I understand, Ripple has very different goals to other cryptocurrencies, i.e. aiming to assist banks with cross-boarder payment processing. So, from the perspective of banks, a large pre-mine providing a solid financial foundation to a central bank-friendly authority all seems great, right?

Also, I was under the impression that anyone can run a server, so even if servers are currently centrally controlled, they aren’t so by necessity."
"I agree, I have no idea how their devs managed to convince dash shills that the instamine is a ""good thing"". Completely fucking ridiculous."
The masternode 'rich get richer' dynamic is highly questionable as well
The GOT character that most reminds me of Dash is Tyrion. Underappreciated and ridiculed, but with a strategic mind that dwarfs all other characters.

There's nothing wrong with earning a passive income. I used to earn passive income in my savings account, and many people earn passive income through affiliation sales and dozens of other ways.

"Yes, definitely more centralized and pre-mined, and focused on reducing overall friction in the transfer of value between the financial players. This focus is actually what makes it so valuable. Think about the TRILLIONS of dollars in flow every day, think about the costs of supporting the respective infrastructure, transfer fees, currency conversion fees, etc... now with a blockchain-driven support structure, these fees go dramatically down. Hence the value of something like Ripple. Ripple, so far, is the only Crypto (I have found, please suggest others) that can scale to the volume that the global economy requires; think about how many VISA transactions occur alone - this is actually a MASSIVE point of contention in global/domestic economies that has been too expensive/complex to solve without blockchain. 

VISA charges merchants around 3% per transaction when you swipe your card at their store. Multiply that times all the VISA transactions and you get serious cash. This will help you: https://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-heres-how-much-currency-is-traded-on-average-every-day-2016-9

"Right on, as long as I profit from i I don't give a fuck if it's a scam or not. Oh and who gives a fuck about transaction fees either. Shut the fuck up, HODL to the moon and buy your fucking lambo.    

God I wish people would stop spreading FUD about Tether so I could get my lambo quicker. <3 Tether <3 Bitfinex <3 Bitcoin pumps."
The potential insolvency could create a second Mt. Gox scenario where people try to bank run, but Tether only has a small fraction of bitcoin's market cap so I wouldn't be too worried.
You're mentioning a lot of potential benefits of blockchain technology in general, why do you think Ripple does it better than the other coins?
"Certainly, thank you for the same.

>As bank transaction fees go down, XRP increases in value - no?

Banks don't really have incentive to scale it to the level of Visa.  There are already alternatives in use, it's just a way for them to to make money off of blockchain hype with a massive supply of tokens that are only used for shuttling money between themselves.

I do think that Ripple is compelling and effective technology, I just already have money invested in a couple banks, so I feel like I have those fronts covered.

>BTW, XRP is not inherently tied to the Ripple platform so all in all, it may very well end up being worthless at some point.

This is an interesting point, and something I haven't really explored since the other main points on Ripple turned me off a bit.  I don't really understand what they're planning on doing with the tokens then, have they laid out any plans?"
"Thanks for having a civilized and educational conversation about this. 

I still dont see how XRP will not increase in value as banks leverage it to minimize their costs when scaling to the level of VISA, for example. As bank transaction fees go down, XRP increases in value - no? 

Not that I have to explain myself to random internet strangers but its important to be accurate - as I mentioned above. So, I seriously am committed to the technology on all the cryptos I'm interested in, and the community as well - IOTA is def my favorite by a long shot but has a long and and windy road ahead of it to help us reach IoT singularity ;) 

BTW, XRP is not inherently tied to the Ripple platform so all in all, it may very well end up being worthless at some point. "
"No, it's mostly first-time users that cause increases in value.  Banks have been investing in cryptos for a long time, gains were nowhere near what we're seeing with widespread adoption.

You also have to consider, you have no chance trading against a bank.  They're able to easily drain all the money out of a market, simply because of how much capital they control."
I believe so, but it may not prevent it from being used or growing in popularity
Fair points, but doesnt the wide spread adoption of one currency by financial institutions increase its value regardless of whether its centralized or not? Yes, the volume in the hands of of the primary holding company could deflate value if introduced back into the market but this is still facilitating the transference of value - which in and of itself is valuable. I dont see how this is NOT valuable.  
Because he holds Ripple and not other coins.
yeah fair lol

No. Who’s on first. 
Everyone is bitter they never invested in a crypto. 
"Went up quite a bit.

The currency was specifically made for micro tips with reddit comments etc. If anyone appreciated value from Bitcoin's fees, it's them. Bitcoin can't at all fill their very tiny niche."
No, because theft is wrong, and there are probably so many citizens that none of them would have enough Bitcoin in their wallet to actually be able to spend it on anything other than miner fees.
I mean in terms of fundamentals. It's still a centralized premine right? 
">definitely more centralized and pre-mined

> focused on reducing overall friction in the transfer of value between the ~~financial players~~ banks

These things *decrease* the value, they do not increase it.  You should consider what the appealing traits of crypto are, then think about if Ripple really satisfies any of those aspects.  

It's mostly a bank entrance into the scene, the fact that it's a premine means they can introduce more supply at any time.  They've played with the supply heavily in the past, when XRP first spiked."
IOTA has no transaction fees and scales much better than any blockchain coin I've come across, check it out
It's not about faith in humanity, it's about doing your due diligence instead of trusting others to answer your questions for you. Bitcoin Cash supporters of all people should know this.

One thing I will say though is it’s done a dam good job of holding its peg to the USD up to now, thats impressive."
great, but your comments don't mention ripple, which has multiple exchanges, so can use the same tactic as BCC. So how has ripple made a deal with CMC?
Well, Elvis was the King of rock & roll
No problem. Easy to miss! 
Young? Ripple in its current incarnation is the second oldest altcoin in the top 100, after Litecoin. Actually the original Ripple system was invented way before Bitcoin. If it were going to do something it would have done it already. Ripple Labs just bought out the concept and added a token to it to ride the altcoin wave in 2013. The massive premine means it's by normal reckoning not even in the top 20. Unless I've missed some major development, it's a sideshow kept alive by a well-paid marketing team.
"I looked at Ripple a long time ago and dismissed it.

What did I miss?"
Centralized, isn't it? Isn't all ripple really does make bank transfers more efficient? I haven't fully read up on it.
DYOR. Why would you just expect people to just spoon feed you accurate answers?
Ponzi scheme.
The actual ELI5 is that the author (@Bitfinexed) sold his Bitcoin at $1000 and has been salty ever since, trying to spread fear in the cryptomarkets in order to destabilize the price and buy back in.
Tether allows Bitfinex to pump the price of bitcoin using monopoly money. For some reason it's working... for now. 
they print millions--hundreds of millions-of tethers out of thin air. They say each tether is backed by 1 USD they have in their bank accounts but have so far refused to release any verifiable audit that proves they have this much cash in their reserves. Also their terms of agreement explicitly say you can't trade your tethers back in for USD. It's all kinds of crazy.

"Check out this link to HBO: http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-connections-ned-promise-tower-of-joy-infographic 

Like you I had originally thought that Jon's father was the mad king, but no.

Jon Snow's father is shown in that link as Rhaegar Targaryen, the brother of Daenerys. So they must be nephew/aunt.

This means Jon has a better claim to the iron throne than Daenerys. He is the legitimate son of the (now dead) rightful heir, she is the rightful heir's sister.

If there's any justice Jon will take the throne and share power with Daenerys.  Or to continue the  crypto parallels, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum will prevail.

But as we all know in GoT no one is safe and anything could happen.  Just like real life."
I’m no fan of Tether (don’t use it and never will) but I *think* their clause of “ we won’t exchange tether for dollars” is more of a wink wink so they don’t have to legally abide by MSB laws 
Jesus, that's really bad. Thanks for simplifying that for me. 
"No, they claim it's backed by ""assets"" not by USD bank reserves.

It's almost certainly other crypto, which coincidentally rises in value as they pump, giving them more leverage for more tether.

It's a cycle that can only go up, until it doesn't :)"

This is amazing
I really don’t understand all the hate for Ripple. They are a Blockchain as a service company more so then a “cryptocurrency” as the uneducated masses call it. It’s really hard to look at XRP through the same lens as other players out there as it does not compare. But it is in fact, not centralized...it’s a distributed ledger fuckwits. It does utilize a private node structure but that’s only because of the companies it’s “service” is aimed towards. It’s very feasible to believe that the banking play is there way in. Builds the network and capabilities amongst banks and major industry players. Once it’s been adopted on a large scale, XRP can be fully utilized as a way for consumers to interface with their respective lender/bank/credit card company. It’s the only currency that is being readily and quickly adopted by the enterprise space. It’s pre-mined with a high supply as they want to keep the fluctuations to a minimum as to carter to their customer base which would be major banks. They also have an asset freeze and release schedule to deal with this high potential cap that is easy to understand and well thought out...you can hate XRP all you want, but please read a little about it before erroneously lumping into categories it has no business being in. It’s a long play, highly disruptive and focused on changing the game from the inside. Quite the opposite of something like BTC which goal was to be a banking alternative.

I've heard about centralization issues with Ripple. I need to do more research into it.
Many believe ripple is a centralized database for banks masquerading as a blockchain.  There is no censorship resistance, decentralization, etc.  Most of the currency is held by the creators (insta-mine) and only a small amount is released for trading 
Ripple is a cool exchange system, not an open blockchain to store your wealth in
"Ripple does things very different than your traditional crypto. Which is why I invested some into it ;) the devs saw a market that would involve banks, so they designed it primarily with them in mind. "
Epic premine, centralized, never needed a token, made a deal with coinmarketcap for special treatment to appear higher in the rankings, banker backed, butts in at government talks, etc.

Bitcoin cash is run by fucking idiot scammers who already took their gains and left, bagholders like OP keep jacking it off and hoping it takes off when all that's left is for it to crash. Litecoin and bitcoin are better than BCH.
In my opinion, the biggest ponzi scheme in crypto right now.  Lots of feverent followers.  But, as always, do your own research and come to your own conclusions

Bitcoin Cash is a “host” of coins?
No problem. I agree with your aside.
"So why go the extra step & respond via Youtube, along with the preface about 'core trolls'? He literally deflects the 'censorship' issue onto his opposition, while censoring his opposition.

>>Due to the **censorship supporting core trolls** loving to intentionally take things out of context to twist them around to mean something completely different than what they actually do, **this AMA will work a little bit differently than most**. "
I stated circumstances of the context in this instance. I don't remember saying DOGE anywhere.
"I had the luck of investing a pretty small sum into NEO when it was AntShares and below one dollar. It’s flirting with $80+ now.

I have at least 4 times my savings account in NEO now, without investing a lot.

My times were off by a little because I didn't know exactly when the AMA started and had to guess a little bit. Here is Roger's answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoSuwEgrshU&t=1h05m10s
Yeah, but I submitted my question only about an hour after the original post. Doesn't seem like a proper AMA if you have to submit your question within the first ~30 minutes of the AMA to get answered.
So that means you sometimes refer to dogecoin as bitcoin? You know, depending on the context?
I would love the answer to this. Anyone know what minute this is? As I am not goong to watch a 2+hr youtube video right now I think this format is suboptimal..
Oh, so Ethereum wasn't meant to be used as a smart contract world-computer? I remember bitcoin meaning p2p electronic cash. Some people remember things differently.

"I think because BCH is bitcoin and today's bitcoin has already been infected by segwit virus. BCH has a group of supporters from early days of bitcoin who has followed its development all the way for over 8 years, and they also built ecosystem and became an important part of it

Of course you could always use any other crypto or even fiat money to do payments (sometimes fiat mobile payment is faster and cheaper), but crypto mainly serves as a hedge for inflation, so most of them just become hoarded, the payment function is less important as long as it does not degraded to current BTC's level, the market acceptance and network effect are more important"
Average I've seen is around $25 right now. It was $1 not long ago and I haven't been into the game THAT long. 
+/u/sodogetip 10 doge verify
Why not Dogecoin? Dogecoin has transaction times of 1 minute, the transaction costs are much cheaper than BCH of even less than a penny, and you can specify it to be $0.000006 if you wanted. Also the main contender of Dogecoin as a currency: There is no hardcap limit, doges will be printed until the end of time. However, there's only ~6 billion printed per year, there's more than 100 billion dogecoins.
At least an order of magnitude (probably two orders of magnitude) more consumers already hold BCH than those who already hold any altcoin. That's why merchants are rushing to adopt BCH.
Why do you expect him to have the answer to that?
Even if its being used in the context of p2p electronic cash, like what you’re arguing for BCH? Why not? 
That fits all segwit advertisements
"What do you mean not as valuable? I once went all in on Bitcoin Cash literally putting in my Bitcoins I've had since 2013 into Bitcoin Cash believing it was the solution back when it was $550. I profited a LOT because BCH more than doubled, it more than tripled in value, but I lost a lot of sleep on Bitcoin Cash as well because of all the FUD and the freaking transaction times. Sometimes it took me 5 freaking hours to send anything, I don't know if that has improved, but trades were not possible with Bitcoin Cash.

I cashed out to BTC before the CBOE futures. I re-discovered Dogecoin, and I found out there could only be 110,000 Dogecoin MILLIONAIRES (people that have 1 million Dogecoins or more), while there can be 21 million people that hold 1 Bitcoin.

In terms of those numbers, it's more than 100x rarer to find a Dogecoin Millionaire than it is to find a person with 1 Bitcoin.

So becoming a Dogecoin Millionaire is > than holding 1 Bitcoin Cash or even 1 Bitcoin. If you're talking about market cap PRICES, yes Bitcoin Cash is more ""valuable"", but you're now using ""Bitcoin Core's"" argument against me, and plenty of people here will say ""Value doesn't describe use case"""
But what does he have to do with it? I could as easily expect you to have the answer. Do you? It sort of sounds like you made up your mind already.
maybe he prefers speaking over typing? I think it's too much to be looking that far into it really. Definitely a different format that most, no-one forced him to do an AMA
I understand you have chosen to go a different way than Bitcoin(Legacy) by creating? Bitcoin Cash(BCC) but what I dont understand is why you are still using the name Bitcoin on your website Bitcoin.com? and no mention can be seen for BCC.

I tried to contact Bitcoin.com at https://www.bitcoin.com/contact-us but it does not work, so I sent a private message to /u/memorydealers asking about the reproducible builds.

I downloaded Bitcoin.com's wallet and tried to launch it.  I got this warning:

> ""Bitcoin.com can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

Should I skip this warning?  After all these years, why didn't Bitcoin.com or Copay get themselves identified as Mac developers with Apple?

I'm suspicious of hardware wallets, like Ledger, because no one knows for sure if a rogue employee has put in any nefarious code into the firmware.  Even the [Ledger link](https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214709-Is-Ledger-an-open-source-project-) says that the firmware is not open source.

What are your thoughts about Electron Cash?

I agree that Craig Wright lacks credibility for what he did.  However, the Gigablock Initiative is showing that BCH can scale massively with bigger blocks.  Don't you think that is providing value?

I've been wondering about nChain.  According to Andrew O'Hagan (https://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n13/andrew-ohagan/the-satoshi-affair), the scientists working for Wright seem to be impressed with Wright.  According to nChain's CEO, Jimmy Nguyen, they will provide several patents (royalty-free) to BCH.  Why do you think that these will have no value?"
I'm just unsure why the need for the preface. He plays this constant narrative that the 'core trolls' are out to get him, but 90% of his time is spent trashing Bitcoin. The 'censorship' bit seems like so much projection.
I didn't know exactly the stream started and had to guess on a lot of the timestamps. Most of the errors should be fixed now. Glad you enjoyed it!
And your persona isn't about Bitcoin Cash? Don't believe me shibe. WOOF!
How do you figure? Being copied from BTC doesn’t mean it’s magically tied to its price.

"I agree it’s one of the only issues with nchain I my book;
A couple of points

- it goes both ways - blockstream also have “defensive” patents they will use to “protect” “bitcoin”

- nchain are reasonably transparent and have effectively stated that the use of the their patents will “probably be free for anyone using Bitcoin Cash, and have fees for other chains

So it’s ok as long as you are BCH"
I'm genuinely grateful. :) Thanks for the information!
"Yeah, that’s true, but your prediction is the opposite of what is actually happening.

Yes, there are a large number of speculators, but there is a growing portion that are actually users. There are increasingly more merchants who accept cryptos.

Also, I’m not saying bitcoin is in a bubble in that way. When it crashes, it will be because the speculators have already pulled out, and the users see that it’s unusable.

At that point, the money will not be pulled out of the market. It will be pulled out of bitcoin and put into better alternatives. Bitcoin Cash will probably receive a disproportionate amount of that money, but monero will get the DN users, ETH will continue its relentless march, and a few of the other coins will also increase.

When bitcoin crashes, I doubt any one coin will replace it."
No. That is not context-dependent.

If I cannot get Bitcoin ABC running on Ubuntu, I will look at OSX. (Though, I agree with you that this is not ideal, because my Mac can get hacked.)

The dmg filename says ""unsigned"": https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.16.1/osx/

Is there a signed version?

I assume that the Bitcoin ABC node will download the blockchain. Is there a pruning option, like in Bitcoin Core?

Yes. Sorry if I gave the impression that I was criticizing you. It was more of an aside.
"Well, it means there is little differentiation in the mind of an average ""investor"".  Let's face it, very few are using any of these coins for anything other than speculation.  If say 10% of people are using these coins for some practical purpose, it means the other 90% are hoping the price will go up. When that doesn't happen consistently, everyone will be headed for the exit. "
"No; even if they mine the next block, you can simply ignore it and continue mining from your own chain.  Since you have more hashing power than the rest of the network combined, you WILL end up with the longer chain.

And yes, actors on the network would actually jump onto the new chain.  It's in their best interest - to continue mining on the orphan chain would be to throw away income."
"> Why do you trust Bitcoin ABC full node wallet more so than Bitcoin Unlimited full node wallet?

I trust Bitcoin Unlimited a little bit less than Bitcoin ABC because the Bitcoin Unlimited leadership announced a quite extensive collaboration with the scammer Craig Wright and his patent troll company Nchain. That was an unnecessary and very inappropriate agreement of collaboration in my opinion. The collaboration was about their joint ""Gigablock Initiative"" project.

> Do ""reproducible builds"" (proof that binaries were compiled from the open source code without tampering) exist for Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin.com wallet? 

I know that they exist for Bitcoin ABC but don't know if they exist for the Bitcoin.com wallet. /u/ftrader can give you the link to his checksums for the various Bitcoin ABC reproducible builds if they're not already available on bitcoinabc.org, and /u/memorydealers can maybe answer your question in regards to the Bitcoin.com wallet app.

> Have the source code been audited by 3rd parties?

Bitcoin ABC is open source just like Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin ABC source code is available for everyone to read through their Phabricator source code repository. The Bitcoin.com wallet app is a fork of the Copay wallet by Bitpay and they're both open source. You can inspect or audit the source code of the Bitcoin.com wallet on their Github source code repository here:

https://github.com/bitcoin-com/wallet

Here's Ledger's statement about their open source and auditability policies:

https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214709-Is-Ledger-an-open-source-project-

I'm not aware of any professional 3rd party source code auditing company having audited Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC, Bitpay's Copay wallet app, The Bitcoin.com wallet app, or any Ledger wallet. As far as I know the 3rd party auditing of the source code from these projects are all done sporadically by volunteers if at all."

Roger responded to a total of 83 questions, some of them very long with several parts, in a little over 2 hours time with a few interruptions included. There was no time limit on question submissions, but since this was a one man AMA that he did entirely and provably all on his own it seemed like he answered quite a lot. Having so many people be very interested in his opinion on various issues was not his fault. Would you select which questions to answer based on upvotes or do it in a first-come first-serve manner? Which is more fair?
"> Should I skip this warning? After all these years, why didn't Bitcoin.com or Copay get themselves identified as Mac developers with Apple?

If I would've gotten that warning then I would've ignored it in this particular circumstance because Apple has had a history of banning Bitcoin-related apps from their app store. So the reason is probably because it's not worth the time and effort to get approved by Apple because they keep changing their mind about whether to allow Bitcoin-related apps or not allow them. But that's just my guess. I've never used Apple products or services (except for one Apple TV for Netflix and stuff).

> I'm suspicious of hardware wallets, like Ledger, because no one knows for sure if a rogue employee has put in any nefarious code into the firmware. Even the Ledger link says that the firmware is not open source.

Yes I'm suspicious too. I would not trust them with more than about 10 % of my cold storage coins at a time. For maximum trust I'd trust the Bitcoin ABC full node software and wallet specifically. But there's a tradeoff there and that tradeoff is that Bitcoin ABC is only as secure as the rest of that desktop computer is secure. If the OS on the desktop computer gets hacked then it won't matter that Bitcoin ABC has been audited and concluded to be trustworthy. So hardware wallets have their usecase.

> What are your thoughts about Electron Cash?

I did not use it because I personally have little knowledge about its developer and their reputation. But it's been several months now and no one has been complaining about the wallet having stolen any coins. The wallet program is open source too I think so it's probably been audited sporadically by random people. It's a fork of Electrum if I remember correctly so an audit of only the changes shouldn't take too much time and effort.

I trust Roger to never intentionally steal my coins through his ""Bitcoin.com wallet"" app so I personally trust that app the most at the moment for transactions involving smaller to medium amounts. For large amounts I'd probably use a freshly installed and updated Ubuntu LTS OS with Bitcoin ABC running and nothing else installed or running. 

But I'm unnecessarily paranoid about losing coins so much lower security precautions are probably ok too. It's very rare that people complain about losing coins considering that there are probably tens of millions of people in the world that are currently handling quite large sums of money.

> I agree that Craig Wright lacks credibility for what he did. However, the Gigablock Initiative is showing that BCH can scale massively with bigger blocks. Don't you think that is providing value?

Scammers provide value from time to time or no one would ever want to collaborate with them about anything. That doesn't mean that it's a good idea to collaborate with scammers. There are plenty of other people in this world to collaborate with.

> According to nChain's CEO, Jimmy Nguyen, they will provide several patents (royalty-free) to BCH. Why do you think that these will have no value?

Nchain has a huge amount of Bitcoin-related patents. I'm against the patent system as a whole and I'm very suspicious about anyone who has a patent about anything. In this particular case this Nchain company was founded by the known scammer Craig Wright and he said in one of his earlier presentations at a conference that it's his patents and that there's nothing wrong about him trying to profit from them any way he sees fit. I don't expect for a second that Nchain or Craig Wright are going to be using their Bitcoin-related patents ""defensively"" or ""for the benefit of the Bitcoin Cash currency or community"". They're a patent troll company plain and simple. They just haven't started the patent trolling yet.

So in conclusion, the Nchain / Craig Wright patents are of *negative* value so not just ""no value""."

In a proper AMA, the questions posted to Reddit are answered there. Posting a YouTube video is a cop-out.

I mean to be fair taking 50% of your 80x profit doesnt seem to warrant regret in any place. Fiat is much more useful in the world than cryoto as a currency (for now).
Not sure why you are getting down voted. It's a real question. Not sure where it comes from though. 
Let me turn this around on you. Bitcoin split into two. Why is Bitcoin Core the valid Bitcoin? I say it's an invalid chain.
He didn't answer it, I watched the whole thing.
I too would like to hear him answer this question specifically. If someone has a time stamp, I would really appreciate it. Last time I heard him try to answer a question like this he cited Metcalfe's law and I could not roll my eyes harder.
"I'll give you my answer. I'm sure Roger would mostly agree.

Bitcoin is the original deal. It's likely the biggest thing to happen in the 21st century which will forever change human society. Bitcoin is huge and important. And with such a monumental and valuable change to society, the history and legacy of the Bitcoin blockchain is just as valuable. Bitcoin Cash has all of Bitcoin's original history, up until August 1st, 2017.

Bitcoin is still a new and exciting technology. Not many people know what it is or the basics of how it works. Even fewer people on this earth know all the in-depth technical details of how the technology works (to the degree that they could maintain and modify the source code safely). That is why I believe the protocol must remain simple and true to the original Satoshi white paper. We do not need to segregate signatures from transactions with a soft fork hack. We do not need to ruin Bitcoin's original cash-like properties in order to force Lightning hubs down all our throats. It's way too fucking early for that bullshit. What needed to be done was to scale the blockchain first. Money is Bitcoin's first application. If it can't even do *that* right, then what value does it really have? So that's what Bitcoin Cash does. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin scaled the way it was supposed to be. It's still Satoshi's original invention and not some new-fangled crypto coin.

People say Bitcoin could one day go the way of Friendster or Myspace. But look at the cryptocurrency market. None of the shitcoins ever truly die. There's always some bloke somewhere mining one, and there's always some Joe somewhere buying it from some other Joe somewhere else. Neither Bitcoin Core nor Bitcoin Cash will ever die. I suspect if Core ever enters a difficulty death spiral, an emergency hard fork will be released that either changes the PoW algorithm or the difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Bitcoin's blockchain is a sort of DNA. Sometimes it branches off and evolves, but every version shares that same original genesis block - the greatest common ancestor. The Bitcoin blockchain's history will never die so long as humans (or even machines) value any kind of cryptocurrency (not just Bitcoin). So when I invest in Bitcoin, it's not *just* the technology I'm investing in. It's the name and the history. People invest in gold because of its history. Platinum is a more industrially useful metal but you'll hardly ever see a precious metals person salivate over platinum. Value comes from collective human consciousness. That is why the history and legacy of Bitcoin is so important and carries immense value.

tl;dr: Bitcoin Cash holds more history than any other altcoin, it's the better version of Bitcoin, and it holds true to Satoshi's original brilliant vision."

Typical virus behavior is infecting your machine and do something else that you are not aware of, segwit does exactly that, most of the users don't even know what segwit is doing out there, but it is already infected the network with insecure new transaction formats and make the TX handling slower, this is also the symptom after being infected by virus: You don't know what has happened, but your machine become slower

The limit is high but then the US also wants to tax you on your capital gains.
Americans working in an other country also have to pay taxes to the country they work in right? So they are taxes twice on the same income? Crazy..
"Or you know, you can do like in Europe where if they can prove that you reside somewhere for more than 6 months, you have to pay your taxes there.

This isn't true, 51% is where an attack becomes likely to succeed, you still have a 51% chance of mining the next block. You're assuming that if the attack were successful, actors on the network would jump onto the newchain without questioning it.
Correct

Currently the limit for excluded foreign income is $102,100, so if you earn over that you have to pay income tax to the IRS. It's kind of ridiculous, but at least the limit is quite high. Still retarded though.
That's an aspect I haven't much familiarity with. I know that there is some relief you can get if you already paid taxes on money too.
"u/DarkLord_GMS it was a great AMA, I had my phone ready for the private key but wasn't fast enough!

Hey, could you help me with an unconfirmed BTC TXN?"
"Yeah, transaction fees are based on the size of the transaction in bytes, not the value in btc. Miners are deciding which transactions are worth fitting into the block so the quantity of importance is the ratio fee/transaction size in BTC per byte.

So if you have $100 and try to send it to someone the  may be drastically different depending on whether someone sent you that $100 at once or if 20 people sent you $5."
The reason it is called a 51% attack is because at 51% of the hashing power, you have a 100% chance of mining every single block, consecutively, by discarding all other blocks in the attack.  You may want to check your math.
So roughly 1/3333

So you imagine scenarios where I must feel shame about something, suggest suicide or condemn me whenever you see opportunity.  Free speech is speech without consequence.  If there is consequence then that speech is not free, is it?  Free speech is speech without fear of retaliation.  In your posts you try hard to retaliate by demonstrating how great you are and how great I am not.  You drip of condescension.

Here you go again telling me what you have when I have clearly stated that I do not care what you own in the slightest, numerous times. I like how you tell me what you know I know.  Its not working.  Nobody even cares about what it is that you think you are attempting to achieve.  Why don't you elaborate?  Can you please tell me how great it is to be rich?  I really want to know what you own and what you do with your money.  I really do.  Really do.  Really.  Do."

Notice how I didn't bitch about the tone you use and accuse you of bullying.  Free speech is for unpopular speech, you don't like free speech in that sense.   You just like free speech in the sense that you can post mindless garbage on reddit.  Anyone can post their opinion on line, it takes a moron to point to it as fact.  You have linked me to that shitpost like 5 times in this thread and then you say I am chasing rabbits.  

I have an attorney and I am considering my options. Could do a CRT, could start my own tax exempt organization (oprah has one), or leave the country.   Any way you cut it, I will be paying far less taxes than a typical taxpayer, especially with this new sweet tax bill we got.    

When you are rich, you have lots of choices.  When you are poor, you don't get to make many choices, but you know that.  "

Rule 5 is to discourage user abuse.  The language, tone and implications you use is meant to intimidate.  Nobody comes to Reddit to listen to your abuse or to be part of your bullying those of lesser means.  Can you imagine if Oprah did the same thing.  I still don't understand why you don't have as much money as Oprah.  Could you explain your situation?  If you do not divulge the personal information required to explain why you don't have as much money as Oprah then why are you here or even alive?

Libertarian philosophies may have motivated you, but its not how you ""got into bitcoin"".  Nor will the masses use bitcoin because of [libertarianism](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72xxip/satoshi_nakamoto_was_not_libertarian/).

You should read the comments I have written, the articles I blogged about here and there over the years, longer posts I have written about specific things, my Wikipedia contributions and my art work to name a few.  My liberal philosophies is why I got into free speech.  Liberalism has granted me massive freedoms.

>Why would I modify my behavior to try and stop climate change?

Because you, I and every human share the single atmosphere.  Just like there are more people who care about mitigating climate change than who don't, more people want to mitigate libertarianism than those who don't.  Hence laws, taxation, welfare, government.  Your problem is that your monetarist ego inhibits your ability to see the world from other perspectives.  Remember [Satoshi Nakamoto was not libertarian](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72xxip/satoshi_nakamoto_was_not_libertarian/).

Discussion with you is always chasing rabbits I have no interest in. I think a [decentralised web](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7g2hxw/bitcoin_cash_will_usher_in_a_decentralised_web/) is more important than discussion about paying taxes.  Just pay and shut up about it until it comes time to vote.  You say ""I have made a decision to leave the US"" then later you indicate that you haven't made up your mind by using the word if.  What is with the hesitation pussy cat?

"This was amazing. It is a theme/concept I have thought about a lot in my life. It is briefly touched on at the end of the ridiculous movie Lucy. Humans, and probably every living thing, must compartmentalize concepts because it is simply much much more efficient in terms of processing, and communication.

If you take the example of the concept of a cow. When you read the word 'cow', you don't experience the full concept of what a 'cow' really is. You experience a highly simplified version. You will probably experience a rough cow shape with 4 legs, probably white and brown colour, possibly even chewing some grass. Unless something else is specifically described, you are unlikely to conceive of anything more than that. A cow is almost infinitely more complex than that though. It is made up of trillions of cells, each with complex internal mechanisms and external interactions. Then you have the behaviour of the cow and its social interaction, and interaction with the ecosystem. You also have the connection the cow has with all its ancestors and therefore all life itself. 

Clearly we do not have the mental capacity to think about every concept in this depth, so we compartmentalize everything into very basic concepts. The issue comes when people think the simple concept _is_ the thing itself.

Like you say, we see this in all concepts that are used by Core (fork, Bitcoin, altcoin, consensus, fee market, scaling, decentralization, ledger, node, implementation, full blocks). They have compartmentalised these concepts to nothing more than the word itself, sometimes not even that. Some of these concepts have been reduced down to just a feeling that you're supposed to feel (altcoin, decentralisation, consensus). You see them constantly say that they must fight for decentralisation. Then you ask them for a definition of 'decentralisation' & some way to measure it and they cannot provide one.

The key to understanding complex concepts is temporarily expanding the compartments you create for concepts as required. Core supporters are constantly having to simplify the concepts they assess to make sure a contradictive reality does not seep in. This is how we have ended up at a point where they are saying 'not using bitcoin' = 'using bitcoin'. "
"Yes language is so very important. Before you can truly communicate with somebody you will need to define each other your language first. When I use the word ""god"" or ""faith"" or ""I believe"" I can mean the exact opposite of what you mean when you use those very same word. Just like in the old days two modems that start talking with each other first try to find out some information before they actually start sending each other data. Humans need to this too, or otherwise no real dialogue can be had. "

BTC, for a very large number of people, can no longer function as intended. Transactions below $1,000 can now only happen economically via exchanges because onchain fees are above USD $20 per transaction. Effectively, for most people, this is centralisation. "
"> Bcash

I already corrected you once."
"I've been doing all my trading, moving between exchanges, and cashing out using ETH; works just fine for me. Hardly anyone actually uses any crypto to buy legitimate products because none of them are fast or cheap enough to be convenient, and if they are, then those aren't accepted anywhere."

Wow, that's so cheap! /s
"median fees will probably not get in the next block, so no, it's not more appropriate to the comment I responded to.

edit: I stand corrected, median is probably more appropriate because it ignores large dust transactions"
More appropriate would be **three-four magnitudes lower**. $16 or $27 - makes no difference
Very much depends on your tx, if you spend many outputs your fee will skyrocket,
Agreed. We don’t need to exaggerate to show BTC is failing and it makes us look like FUDders. 
"If you have a transaction that has many inputs, the fees will be even higher than $20.

A $150 transaction consisting of 30 five dollar inputs would have a fee of about $140"
$6 or $7 still nullifies its use as currency. Fees have been doubling every 70 days. They're not going down and LN will only add demand for base layer block space.
But isn't maintaining the LN channel cost money
"We are comparing BTC against instant transfers between accounts for free as happen in many countries, right? I mean it can't be that we are only thinking of developing countries with no other choices? 

Because that's the only criteria I think could be used for $6 fees .... "
I'm saying that with the current state of things, a merchant can accept Bitcoin with the same level of risk and hassle as credit cards, but with lower fees.
"Maybe, but then you would be a shoplifter (and probably other things too, IANAL).

Credit cards have chargebacks and paper checks can bounce, so Bitcoin isn't an extra risk for merchants."
Then why are merchants abandoning BTC in droves. Steam said the delays are unworkable because the price is too volatile, forcing them to ask the customer to make another transaction to cover the difference in price, and then that transaction gets stuck in the queue as well. They washed their hands of it and many other merchants are doing the same. To believe merchants are fine with 24 hour confirms, you would need to have your head thrust so far into the sand that there is magma licking your eyebrows.
When you consider how there's often a few days of bank processing before fiat funds are actually available, Bitcoin looks even better.  Only 24 hours to get the money, not 48 or 72 if there's a weekend involved.
Zero conf doesn't work reliably on BTC.

No, not really. The exchange where they would top up their balance would use Lightning routed to the channel they already have open.

"How low fee? And is it acceptable for most businesses to have to check a transaction's fee before deciding if they will take a 0-conf trans as payment?

Phew, that's only 3 grand to open 3 channels.  I think we've all got that at the bottom of the sock draw so we can pay for those beers with the bar down on the corner.
Anyone who spends less than they earn will eventually exhaust their channels. They will be unable to receive additional payments until they open a new channel or spend some of their accumulated savings.
But every hop will cost some amount of fees, so limiting opening and closing channels will be a trade-off with fees. 
Yeah, 7
Not sure I follow.  wouldn't it be better to sell at a higher price and eat the $100 transaction fee than to wait for a 50%+ crash and not pay the fee?
"> I doubt the BCH devs could even make BCH compatible with LN without ripping off Core's code. Again.

I don't think so. But even if: That's *irrelevant*: It is all open source and legal to do so :-)

There is a small chance, by that time you will too late. If you had btc before 1 Aug and didn't sell your BCH you should be ok.
Thank you for clarifying. Is the “deposit” paid by the party making the first transaction or is it up to the two parties to decide who pays what percentage? If I don’t liquify a payment until the refund window is closed, that still gums up my business a bit.
Zoom out on your fee chart. 1$ used to be unthinkable. 5$ used to be unthinkable. 20$ used to be unthinkable. 100$ is near inevitable at this point.
Fees will be in the thousands within a couple years.

All Segwit transactions are anyone can spend.
what happens if you then move your bitcoin (with higher fee). won't the 'overnight' transaction fail?
You're right. My other issue is waiting for long term capital gains taxes, I'm incentivized to wait until February. I could profit take to pay those taxes but I'd rather wait so I can just pay them from my normal wage. Otherwise I'd have to profit take, they'd be to expensive.
"Only if you hard fork the chain and everyone else agrees to follow your hard forked chain.

Yes, but can there be a balance?  Is the level at which fees for on-chain transactions are high enough to discourage simple direct usage, yet LN is still affordable?  There are so many things about LN that are vague and contribute to it being a substance-less fantasy.
Great I won't tell anyone this whole block size debate was a complete waste of time, if you won't.

Definitely. $1 to send $100,000 is reasonable. $1 to send $2 is outrageous.

"Why would they run to replace it? Any transactions that did take place were fairly minor in the first place, and would have dried up to almost nothing over the past year. I don't see why they would be eager to do more crypto. The whole reason they stuck with it was because they wanted to ready to step into the future and be ahead of the trend, but the trend has been downward, toward less and less use.

They *should* switch to Bitcoin Cash, but it will be a hard sell for many of them even though dropping Bitcoin Core support will be an easy choice.

I still have a small amount of BTC that I’d have dumped already if I could do it cheaply. Of course if (the value today - the fees of today) > (the post-crash value - the post-crash fees) then it would still make sense to dump but frankly I resent the fees at this point. It’s not logical but it’s my honest feeling. I’m just never having a good time when I use BTC these days. It used to be so exciting and now it’s a disappointing chore. 
Good info. Thankfully I don't have like-kind activity, and have been doing FIFO.
"Not any more than pooled mining.  Sure, a node with more resources will be more connected, but the difference here is that anyone can open a node and add utility to the network.  When routing, the larger nodes will be routing more transactions (which may appear centralized) but the reality is that if the network can be made connected enough (again, anyone can create a node - and it is incentivized with low fees), then there are ways to avoid ""central"" nodes which may attempt to exploit fees from users.  So actually, it appears there is a built-in counter-centralization incentive.  It's a balance between utility and user needs.  Much like a good exchange which attracts lots of users - if they start pulling ""dick moves"" the users can go elsewhere quickly."
That's the issue, I sold my BCH in ignorance a few months back. 
Doesn't it increase centralisation?
u/tippr $1 sorry it's not much. 
"The act of opening a payment channel between two parties is really them deciding to create a pot that only they control. Off-chain, before broadcasting the ""open a payment channel"" transaction, they decide how much each party will put in the pot of their own money. The pot then starts out labeled with how much each party out in it. The ""open a payment channel"" transaction includes signatures from both parties, so both parties ""make"" the payment channel.

You don't have to keep a payment channel open longer than you want to; part of the 'trustless' nature of the channels is that either party can close the channel and walk away at any time, without needing the other party's consent/cooperation. So you as the merchant could say you'll keep it open for 10 days in case of a refund need, but if the zombie apocalypse comes tomorrow and you want to pack up shop, you can close the channel early, get your funds out, and deal with the PR consequences later. Or you negotiate with the buyer that you will only keep the channel open until the end of the business day before closing it out to settle accounts for the day."
If centralised Exchanges take load off the main network by using Lightening to bundle their transactions, doesn't this help decentralization in the long run?
not true.  blockchain is 10 minute confirmations, LN is near instant.  LN provides utility to bitcoin beyond capacity and lower fees.  
You can go use LN right now actually. https://htlc.me/ to get your free test bitcoins, then go buy some coffee https://starblocks.acinq.co/ - even the haters gotta admit this is freakin awesome!
no - the idea is that it works with all connecting parties.  It's Lightning *Network*.  The degree of connectivity depends on how many channels each node opens.  If a node opens 3 channels, great - you can route transactions.  If a node opens 100 channels, well, you can route more transactions.   
"So it's cool with you to use open source code and also try to claim the brand name from the people who you forked it from?
Good to know."
Valid point. Between you and me, I suspect they will increase blocksize on BTC when lightning is a bit further along. I feel they are probably planning on keeping fees high enough to 'encourage' users to do lightning for the day-to-day stuff.
"No. Not on the protocol level at least. If the other person you have the open channel with demands for a payment, then you can always close it, even without their agreement and without any risk.

Maintaining channels are just as costly as maintaining any other connection on the Internet. If you want it 24/7 then you need two devices always online, otherwise you can set it up any way you want to."
Yes, i know. Bcash is correct. If we are both reffering to the fork (altcoin) of Bitcoin. 
"On [this page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets), you can find a list of markets that offer BCH trading pairs. This doesn't necessarily mean they will sell you BCH for fiat though. Some exchanges are crypto only and don't accept fiat, some exchanges only sell BTC for fiat. Idk which to recommend cuz Idk which sells BCH for fiat, but what I would suggest is you buy BTC and then trade it for BCH.

To buy BTC, you can use most exchanges, Coinbase seems to be very popular. I've heard bad things about Kraken here on this sub so avoid that. I use QuadrigaCX cuz I'm Canadian and they are local to me. You can also buy Bitcoin from an ATM, though they usually charge high fees in my experience - high compared to exchanges. You can try localbitcoins.com to meet people in person, it's kind of like a Craigslist for Bitcoin I guess. Speaking of Craigslist, Bitcoin is popular enough that people sell it there too, but I would recommend the first two options over meeting someone (exchanges and ATMs).

Finally, when you have your Bitcoin, you can easily use changelly.com or shapeshift.io to quickly and conveniently trade different cryptos with each other. I would suggest you go to both websites, see how much they would give you for your bitcoin, and go with the one that charges the cheaper rate. Changelly requires you make an account and login but you don't have to be verified or anything so it's very quick. On the other hand, if you bought your BTC from an exchange, you can likely just trade it right on the exchange for BCH (if they offer a BTC/BCH trading pair).

Make sure you have wallets for both where you control the private keys. Also, if you are a beginner wanting to learn more, there is a sub you may be interested in checking out: /r/BitcoinBeginners."
"You cannot afford to open a channel, you have to rent usage of one from an exchange.  It doesn't get more centralised than that. No-one will be able to afford to buy and run their own channels.  The run your own node idea, becames unaffordable and impractical.

Also what load do they remove?  There are no low value payments any more to remove.  The current fee market and full blocks are driven by high value movements (wallet to exchange and back most likely, and OTC trades).  This all stays, in addition to any low value payments that can make it onto a channel."
"Sent two transactions on Sunday.

Coinbase and Electrum were suggesting a fee of around £12-13.

I set 120 sat a byte and paid around £4 a transaction. One didn't have much change and got in on the next block.

The other had half a bitcoin in change and took a few more blocks.

I was surprised I've got to say but £4 is still way too high to send a £50 christmas present to my nieces."

Well, even as an avid bitcoin enthusiast, I have to respectfully disagree. 
Time value of money. Important concept that most don't think about but this is where banks make there bread and butter. The longer they can delay payments, the more time they can interest on that money

"Could they do it at that point? Yes. Could they do it now? Also yes.
 
Do they do it? No."
No-one was saying that.   We're all aware of relaying and it's unsolved problems.
But the channel that the person has open could never receive more BTC to it than the amount that the party they opened the channel with in the first place was willing to commit to the channel.
"Once a channel is exhausted in one direction it can only be 'topped up' by shifting the balance in the **opposite** direction. You may be able to negotiate with your counter-party to pay them off-chain to rebalance in your favor, but that comes with some cost, monetary or in terms of trust. They've got you in a tough spot then as well. They could ask for a high fee, not just to rebalance but even for normal outflow transactions, because they know your only other option is to close out on-chain.

If you're spending less than you're earning, you will always be pushing your channels closer to exhaustion. Rebalancing between multiple channels can help stretch their utility, but your net inflow can never exceed the sum total of your channel funding commitments, and any one inflow transaction can never exceed the available balance of the channel on which it occurs."
Double check the tax laws and the proposed changes. It is not clear that long term capital gains will be a viable option for crypto gains.
"Exactly. I think a better way to look at it would be as a percentage of the amount sent.

I've seen transactions lately where 80% of what is sent is taken as fees. That's asinine!"
I'm a huge bitcoin>BCH guy, but if you are arguing that Bitcoin is useful as a currency right now you're wrong. We need a 2mb blocksize increase ASAP.

yep. I think the exchanges becoming paybitcoinpal is pretty much the end result. Then why not just use paypal or another crypto? This reminds me of when circle went from bitcoin to fiat.
"7 Billion people on earth. 1 MB blocks. Typical transaction size: 500 byte. So around 2k transactions per block. 7M blocks needed to open and settle a channel. 7M*10min = 133 years

Even if you assume only 2B people use the internet, that's still 38 years.

By comparison, I'd say with current technology, the BTC network could handle 1GB blocks. Then it'd be 7B people could open and close a channel every 50 days. Or, 2B people could open and close a channel every 14 days. IMO this is the way to scale BTC when the entire world is using it. You'd use LN for small, low-trust everyday transactions and would still be able to use pure BTC for sending larger sums."
Bitcoin won't be as useful for settlement if other cryptos begin to consistently have larger trading volumes. Blockstream is not going to have a valid business model pretty soon.

Yes."
"> I realized I'd have to pay $100 on my transaction

If you're moving funds from cold storage to an exchange, you don't _have_ to pay $100 (what wallet are you using that's forcing you to do that?). Depending on how spread out your inputs are, your wallet may be giving you $100 as a suggested fee to get the transaction processed within a few hours. Paying quarter that fee or less would still be a valid transaction, and would clear whenever the mempool dipped enough to touch your fee level (remember, the mempool doesn't have to be ""empty"" for your transaction to go through, it only has to have few transactions with fees higher than yours for yours to be likely to be processed). 

If your fee is too low, your transaction would be eventually dropped and you could try again, which is no different from what you're currently doing (sitting and waiting for a mempool dip), but if you make a low-fee transaction now, and let it sit, it will get processed for you automatically, without you needing to catch the network at the right time."
">The question is, will the TX fees die down enough that I don't have to shell out $100 to do that?

I'm not expert but I don't think it's going to get any better. I would just eat the cost now."
It's funny how the discussion about fees always revolves around fiat.
Think his point was $6-7 isn't $20, and by blowing it so out of proportion you're killing your own credibility (the sky is falling!!!)
Legacy BTC should be more valuable than Segwit Coins because they cannot be stolen.
I own a small business and, even when things are going well, we simply don’t have enough money lying around to have it tied up in channels. We’re happy to pay small tx fees to stay liquid but we’d never consider locking up $MAX at the start of the start of the day. If PayPal asked for a deposit before we could start accepting card payments for the day, we’d be finished doing business with PayPal. 
This is what I want to hear as well. Litecoin is fast and the fees are already cheap.
Have you seen the ln dev video? They expect they will need up to 133mb blocksize with lightning when the whole world uses btc. They want to raise the blocksize as late as possible.

"Payment channels will only be viable for payment processors like BitPay and CoinBase.  The simple fact is that merchants will not accept payments over payment channels because they cannot afford to hold BTC in a payment channel.  They have to sell immediately.  The only logical place payment channels make sense is if you open a payment channel to BitPay and then BitPay pays the merchants that take BTC as payment.

With BCH, all this nonsense is mute because fees are low and there is no replace by fee.

If the LN is going to work, they'd better get off their asses and start working with these payment processors and wallet software makers.  That's the only way BTC can hold its edge and keep users interested.  If they don't we're going to take all their customers and infrastructure."

"When LN starts being used, transactions on the blockchain can only be cheaper, as part of them will be instead in LN.

It is the rise of Bitcoin adoption that can increase the fees as more transactions start being created. Unfortunately however, Bitcoin is not being adopted that fast, we will not have enough transactions on the network to make fees that high even if we don't use LN for many years."
Why do you insist on exaggerating? I know you have a coin to shill but I would have thought big blocks could sell themselves. Also this https://twitter.com/whalecalls/status/936768494338760704 as proof your fee tyraid is near fiction.

Roger Ver used to be a big fan of LN. Wonder what happened? Oh yeah... he sold the majority of his bitcoin (according to him) for BCH. LN will allow instant transfers for less than 1 cent. Will make BCH useless. Guess he's scared.

I'm a regular Joe, not running a bitcoin business."
Pure FUD, you wil pay 10-50 cent if you want to open a LN channel, nice try Roger.
"Why would a *bank* even want to do this over just keeping the system they had? Or implementing their own private chains?

The more and more I see, I think Bitcoin in the end has just become the worlds largest pump and dump scam and nothing more by AXA and DCG. LN will never happen, they'll just cash out and leave BTC to die. "
Who will pay $100+ to open a channel to lessen the congestion? :-)
32MB per 10 min block provides 56 tx/sec. Scale that for 10,000 or 20,000 tx/sec and you'll quickly see why there is skepticism.

Unlike you, he can afford to open payment channels.  Start saving.  Better hope that when the party on the other end of your channel tries to rip you off by settling the channel, you can afford to post your challenge transaction for the $100-$1000 it will cost you.
"And how many BTC wallets require an internet connection to generate keys? More than I can count on one hand. This is why you use the ""core"" coin protocol - not some website - to secure your keys.

Well, fiat is kinda the standard. It's what we all get paid in, or at least almost all of us.
Enlighten me, how can segwit coins be stolen? 
"As the merchant-end of a payment channel, you wouldn't have to lock up funds into a channel. If the point of a given channel between Alice and Bob is that Alice is going to be paying Bob (Bob, the merchant, in this scenario), they can open a channel with $50 from Alice and $0 from Bob. Then when the transaction (or several small transactions) happen, that $50 gets reassigned to be $10 Alice and $40 Bob, and then closed out. Bob the merchant didn't have to tie up any initial funds in that.

Though it may be  beneficial for the Alice/Bob channel to stay open until whatever refund window Bob has for Alice's purchases expire. If Alice is unhappy with her purchase and wants to return it, the original channel could be re-settled (no transaction fee, if it was still open) as $50 Alice and $0 Bob and closed out to get Alice her money back. "
The $100 figure isn't static, right? There are moments when the fee drops to a few bucks, so to me it looks like it's a matter of timing it right.
I'm making offline wallets just fine, what the fuck are you talking about?
Exchanges?
"Who will pay 100$ for a transaction in the first place?
If there is no one paying 100$ for a transaction that the fee will be lower. It is a free market. Miners have an incentive to put all the transactions they can into their block, no matter the fee.

If you pay a certain amount for a transaction, then why not just pay it once for all of your transactions?"
Affording the payment channels is one thing. You've also got the expense of keeping your node secure. Since Lightning Network nodes require access to the private keys to manage their channels, they effectively act as hot wallets. The security requirements for operating a Lightning Network node are substantially higher than a Bitcoin node. This is especially true for anyone who would like to receive payments or act as an intermediary in an automated fashion.
You can upload your entire balance to the LN, use it for years, and then close it. During that time, you could make every transaction you ever need to make for free or for close to free, INSTANTLY, while in the meantime acting as a hub and collecting fees from people using your channel. Sounds pretty freakin awesome to me. And judging by your initial reaction of making a baseless personal attack on me, I'm going to assume that means you lack the level of intelligence needed to understand how LN actually works and actually debate someone without resorting to uninformed insults.
Implementing LN would just be admitting that BCH was wrong, and would be implementing a 2nd layer solution that already would have mass adoption by a larger coin. Would be RIP BCH.
I doubt the BCH devs could even make BCH compatible with LN without ripping off Core's code. Again.
For as long as I choose.
"Except this would be one time payment for all your future transactions.
Technically opening a channel doesn't need to cost anything other then just normal mining fees as the opening of a channel happens on the blockchain."
Bcash
"That's ICO casino tokens, not actual commerce?

Edit: I assume the downvotes mean there is a lot of actual commerce that can be pointed to?"
Considering my last few BCH txs were for less than a penny, yes that is stupid high.
They may also increase the blocksize when LN goes live so that would relieve fees to get onto LN.  We do need some fees to prevent sustained DDOS attacks on the network.  It's about balance, however.  
"> the wallet REQUIRES internet to issue private keys

Not sure if trolling or if you've been genuinely brainwashed to believe that the bitcoin.com wallet is the ""official"" (or indeed the only) wallet that can handle BCH. I ask because, by your logic, ""BTC's wallet"" does as well, because the bitcoin.com wallet and copay also can handle BTC.

> BCH is significantly down vs if you had held $BTC 

[As compared to when? That's not what I'm seeing over the long term](https://www.coingecko.com/en/price_charts/bitcoin-cash/btc)

> The bleed has begun and look at the charts to prove it

Please, show me these ""charts""... Because [my charrs](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/BitcoinCash-BCH) say the **exact opposite**.

Of course I don't expect you to respond... But I'm curious as to how on earth you believe you can convince anyone of such blatant bullshit."
I just lay out that scenario to let people see how absurd it is
"Bitcoin.com wallet is not ""BCH wallet"". If you don't like it, use a different wallet. There's a reason the bitcoin.com wallet requires an internet connection to make the wallet, I don't remember exactly what it is...something about it using a different service to create the wallet.

Coinbase is not dumping BCH. They're giving it to their users who can do what they want with it. With the performance of BCH lately, I can guarantee you there will be far less people selling their BCH than holding it. There's also a lot of people waiting for Coinbase to enable BCH trading so that they can buy BCH."
"> Will make BCH useless. Guess he's scared.

Nope, BCH will just adapt LN if it turns out to be useful. Which I am doubtful about, because we have payment channels already.

Good luck with 1MB4EVA (or should I say ""4Mweight4EVA""? LOL..)"
Can you share the calculation on that 1 cent fee? Seems unlikely unless I share life savings with unknown nodes and hubs on a network less secure than Bitcoin (Core or Cash), paying multiple 3rd parties to watch my savings 24X7.  
You need to make sure your channel stays open 
if i would pay 10-50 cent to open a LN channel i could just use Bitcoin normally

$6 is insanely high 
If you told bitcoin users the truth years ago they wouldn't have gone along with it.
Even if BCH was terrible that wouldn't make BTC good. That would just mean bitcoin is dead and apart from speculation it is time to go to a new crypto. It doesn't help you any.

"Do you know of any banks that ""openly"" (covertly is another matter, but it requires a great deal of obfuscation and laundering to prevent government action) accept to deal with unverified entities?

Get real."
"It’s a story as old as time. Overthrow the dictator to insert ourselves as dictator. “Disrupt the banking industry” to become the banking industry. These people don’t want to change the world. They just want their turn at the top. There was a post on /r/Bitcoin the other day literally called “The Millenial’s Revenge”. Remember when we wanted to bank the unbanked world? 

I don’t even care about the price of BCH at this point; I’m just happy it’s keeping the dream alive."
"I transferred some BTC into Coinbase, and only paid about 20¢ in fees.  It took a day to go through, but I wasn't in a hurry.

If you realize that many stores run credit cards in a nightly batch and just check for validity when swiped/inserted, low fee Bitcoin transactions that take overnight to confirm aren't terrible for brick-and-mortar shops.  The cash register can just check the mempool, which should have the transaction in seconds."
So go transact with others who feel the same. The majority doesn't trust big block trajectory.
You're in r/btc! Big blocks sub.
My node won't verify transactions that don't follow the Bitcoin issuance schedule or create fall coins. I literally don't have to trust anyone, although my chain may become the minority chain. The only thing I cannot control is the price.
"Ok.. why are you so obsessed with what other random people say? Focus on technical aspects and facts and not meaningless ramblings.

To give you some facts: Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin. Satoshi said about a blocksize increase that it can be 'phased in later'. Satoshi described Bitcoin as 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system'. Satoshi did NOT plan to implement segwit. Satoshi did NOT plan to implement the lightning network. Satoshi did NOT plan to have Bitcoin limited in a way that makes transactions prohibitively expensive.

Bitcoin Core has been hijacked. Public communication channels are censored by notorious anonymous censor 'theymos'. Core developers work for the company Blockstream that will profit off of the lightning network and other products based on driving usage away from the Bitcoin Core main chain.

Now you know, Bitcoin Cash is the original Bitcoin. "

I don't care for the personalities like Ver or whatever, I think it distracts from the entire cause. I just want true discourse instead of circle jerking and partying like it's the 1980's on the other sub."
"Yes, you can make two one-way payment channels, but then I don't think you will be able to make an unlimited number of transactions.  So, for example, if two channels are established, one from Alice to Bob and the other from Bob to Alice, say each in the amount of 1 BTC, then after Alice has sent 1 BTC to Bob her channel is done, ditto with Bob.  Whereas with a two way channel after each has moved the same amount of funds the single channel would be back to where it started.  Now maybe there is a way around that, but if so, it wasn't obvious to me.

"
"Well, no qualms is one thing. But so far, the only public ""solution"" to the problem of funding two way LN payment channels involves the separating the signatures from the TXIDs, thereby breaking the chain of signatures.  But there are probably other ways of making hard forks that don't require Segwit type solutions.  They just don't seem to have been described.  And I'm not sure if the BCH community would even want them... "
Nice to know that we do in fact have some rational folks 'round these parts.
"I went through the 5 most recent users banned just now.  1 was a spammer, one was already suspended permanently by reddit, one was a brand new account promoting superbitcoin, /u/theblockchainman was consistently an asshole in his history, and the last one had only one ""contribution"" stating ""bcash"" in Roger's AMA(and nothing else), but also had a nice history of calling people cunts.

Seems to me that they're doing a good job of banning the people who need to be banned, without preventing dissenting viewpoints from being raised.

I'm not going to dig through the bans to prove your point for you.  You find me a recent ban(last ~5 days) that is clearly inappropriate or biased and we can talk.  But I know from personal experience that the mods of /r/btc are very anti-censorship, so I really doubt you will find anything.  Even roger in his AMA said he won't even block people on twitter unless they don't appear to be a real person, regardless of what they say about him.

Both sides are shit, unfortunately. And if you DYOR you’ll find it out for yourself. Ver is a conman and an absolute cunt. 

Bch scalability fix is legit imo, but it’s not sustainable in the long run. Both off chain and on chain scaling need to happen, no matter how much either side tells you that only their opinion is the right one. The problem with bch is that it’s one of the most centralized coins out there. 

Don’t make the mistake of assuming that Ver is behind bch because he believes in some grand ideal. Only the money. He’s a smart guy, I’ll give him that. Smart enough to try and establish himself as the crypto king by basically hijacking a coin alongside Jihan (who controls around 70% of the hashpower on the bch network - might be a little off on the number, that was the last time I looked into it).

You are being an ass though. You think this place is better but it's not. That's just an irrational belief you have. Even in the face of clear examples of censorship, you still defend the censors. Tons of people are banned here. The mods even chase down users they don't like and try to have them banned from the whole site, sometimes. Why are you defending them? Are you a sockpuppet account? why is my account rate limited here? Such free speech, it's like a shock to the heart. 
"You never saw posts of bitcoin ath's here? 

You never saw the troll posts when bitcoin is skyrocketing, for example, asking how we feel?

Where is the censorship? is when a troll insults you or is super negative against you and actual users don't like it and downvote it?

You are right at something, there are more and more people each day super sensitive and down vote for everything that is not according to them. But there was also a post on hot here about this, because these people if they disagree with an opinion they will auto down vote, so /r/btc is not perfect or either any community in the world will be."
Use changelly
Bittrex 
It's traded on numerous exchanges (for some ungodly reason). Just move it to an exchange and sell it. You may have to move it into ETH but that's not a bad thing. Of course you can then move the ETH to BCH if you so prefer, but diversifying into good coins is a good strategy.

Yeah, I think connectable payment channels are going to add some real nifty features in special cases, provided there's willingness to fork in the changes for them, but a global cure-all Lightning Network to replace an inaccessible main-chain... I'm very skeptical - its failure stays a safe 18 months away tho.
It makes no sense at $50-$100. Demurrage through fees alone will wipe out your stake.
"> You think this place is better but it's not.

As I said, you did not provide **clear** examples.  You provided an example that is convincing for **you**.  Great, fine, whatever.  But that is not convincing for me or many others, and I said so, and I said why.  So either provide a better example or just admit you can't.

I'm not saying one is better than the other.

Both subs have obvious biases.  Only difference being that your comments and posts won't be removed in /r/btc for supporting something that is generally not agreed with.  It will just be blindly downvoted so much that no one will  see it anyway.

You have to in order to understand where you stand. And these people have a great deal of money and power. And make no mistake, they are a centralizing factor."
Well the bidirectional channels are going to wander off one end or the other often too, at least if we're talking about nodes of moderate means (which the developers of this are not, they're thinking of like banks). It's way better to be able to make new channels for a third of a cent than to have to figure out clever ways to never have to make channels because transactions cost too much.
"> They just don't seem to have been described. And I'm not sure if the BCH community would even want them... 

Indeed. Lets put them in if they actually turn out to be *useful*. I remember that in earlier times, Bitcoin maximalism was so prevalent because people just said: ""Well, if it turns out that another coin has a nice feature, Bitcoin can just incorporate that into its own chain.""

I hope that mindset comes back for BCH. But then, also, I think there's absolutely no hurry in adopting fancy, unproven stuff.

Electronic cash is the killer app, and BCH *as-is* is very well suited to take that spot."

"To be fair, if the /r/Bitcoin mod logs were public and you did the same examination that you just did for /r/btc, you would come to the same conclusion about the /r/Bitcoin mod team. I can say this from experience, since I used to moderate that subreddit.

The reality is, stupid bans of reasonable people are rare *in general*. Both sides do them regularly. However, unless you are paying extreme attention to the mod logs, public or not, you will not notice these problematic bans. When someone points out a single example to you, you should pay attention to it.

I by no means excuse either side for doing that, I just wanted to point out that neither subreddit is good in that regard."
You just ignored the one you didn't want to talk about lol. Spammers, right. You sound like Luke Jr to me. 
Downvoting is how reddit was supposed to work. It's not censorship. Rather sounds like you have a problem with Reddit itself? I agree there's plenty of shit from both sides, but don't try to trivialise actual censorship which should have been stomped out the moment it began considering the nature of Bitcoin et al.
you can still see downvoted posts though.....

"> Well the bidirectional channels are going to wander off one end or the other often too

Not necessarily, bidirectional channels can be deliberately rebalanced when they are part of a wider network, either manually (for example, routing a top-up from an exchange through the overpaid end of the payment channel), or rebalancing automatically with a smart routing algorithm where someone else's payment takes a detour one or more times through your channel to rebalance it - probably you would pay them a fee for that. Or the channel stops acting as a route in one direction.

However, I don't count on smart automatic routing through non-trivial networks - that's one of LNs unsolved problems, but at least with bidirectional channels the ability to stay balanced is available."
Do you know of any solutions that are designed, coded, and/or tested on a private network?  If so, please send PM.

I think things may have changed since then.  Back then they primarily banned the most aggressive people.  Starting with \#no2x that extended to moderates and anyone that their paranoia saw as an attacker
Because I don't know anything about it and it happened months ago.  I can't possibly evaluate what happened at that time in order to decide if it was justifiable or not.  That's why I said I needed a recent example.  Not to be an ass, just because if you want people to evaluate it independently, it needs to be possible for them to do so.

And for some historical context, here are some interesting articles by very early Bitcoin developers, before they were pushed out by the current crop of devs who call themselves ""Bitcoin Core"":

* [Bitcoin is Being Hot-wired for Settlement](https://medium.com/@jgarzik/bitcoin-is-being-hot-wired-for-settlement-a5beb1df223a)

"
One major thing that /r/bitcoin tends to censor is that Bitcoin Cash has implemented its own malleability fix (using BIP 0146) without needing to use SegWit. This makes it compatible with second layer solutions and, if the Lightning Network ever becomes feasible, it will work better on the Bitcoin Cash chain due to a lack of blocksize bottleneck preventing the timely opening/closing of payment channels.
"If you're wondering why Bitcoin Cash exists I would recommend you read these articles and watch these videos and make your own idea. You think we wanted to fork away? There have been 3 years of this.

Precisely right.  Somebody came up with the clever strategy to start calling the ASICBOOST methods ""overt"" and ""covert"", as if it's illegal or a nefarious thing.  The ASICBOOST whitepaper has no occurrences of either word.

Better than that actually - ASICBOOST still works on Core, period.  SegWit only renders one of three ways to do ASICBOOST infeasible."

RemindMe! 1 day
"BIP 0146 may have fixed third party malleability.  However, the funding transaction of a bi-directional LN channel involves two signatures.  As I understand it, from reading the LN white paper, this means that one of the two signatories funding the LN channel could change his **own** signature, so that the resulting funding transaction would have an altered TXID.  This would mean that the pre-signed transactions that were negotiated by the two parties to the channel prior to funding would be null and void.  Consequently, if one of the two parties were uncooperative or hostile he could lock up the funds the other put in, even going as far as creating a possible blackmail situation.

As far as I can tell, to make the Rube Goldberg two way LN payment channels work it requires additional changes beyond BIP 0146.  I believe I know how this can be done, but I'm not sufficiently embedded in the details of Bitcoin scripts, sigops and LN to be certain.  (And ""certain"" is an ill-defined concept in the absence of a rational, easy to understand specification, as opposed to nightmarish spaghetti code.)"

Although I certainly hope that BCH doesn't implement LN and instead ops in for a different off-chain solution, if any.
"Yeah and another myth is that Bitcoin Cash supporters (like myself) are radically against anything off-chain. Some are and some are not, and most likely it all depends on context. It never was about that anyways it simply was about ""Hey guys blocks are getting full, let's raise the limit cause that was the original plan, before it stops working like we want it too."" 

That was blocked (there was an attempt) because it got in the way of somebody business model (well at least that is the story most people believe, I believe a power is trying to sabotage or slow down crypto and people are the weakest link, I don't believe theymos is the same theymos from the beginning).

So now with Bitcoin Cash at least there is a working version of Bitcoin again.  Eventually it's blocks will get full too, raising blocksize forever won't work but we don't have to stress out about it right now. 

See the 1 mb blocksize limit debate in my eyes was a very sneaky way of trying to slow down Bitcoin, long long long before it even reaches significant user adoption. 

So for the future we are definitely going to need better politics. Because what if some power infiltrates again, maybe this time the Bitcoin Cash developer community and tries it again in another way? 

Anyway that is kind of what I suspect, don't have to much evidence of it though. To me mathematics and code are harder to attack then people. And so if somebody tries to delay or sabotage crypto it makes most sense to go for the people. I think that is what has happened and might happen again in the future.

I absolutely agree BCH is a better digital currency than BTC right now.

I think OSS shows it's strength when people who disagree with the decisions of the development team can fork their own project to maintain.

What I think is stupid is the petty drama over the name of the project. Instead of discussing and celebrating what people feel is the superior coin (BCH), they put all their time and effort into fight over who is the ""real Bitcoin"", even intentionally misleading people and making sure everyone will confuse the two. `/r/btc` and `bitcoin.com` being about `BCH` is stupid.

BCH is growing great and works as P2P payment method.

But instead of focusing on that and the efforts to further advance *a* great cryptocurrency, it's 95% about ""WE ARE REAL BITCOIN! CORE SUCKS!""

If someone calls it ""BCash"", so what? If you feel BTC is shit, let it crash and burn and roll with whatever you feel is the superior cryptocurrency. At times the obsession over the whitepaper and the name Bitcoin feels downright religious, throwing all practicality out of the window."

An offline IOU is also a contract that can be enforced. You can make the enforcement easier, more secure and less messy than enforcing a ""normal"" IOU (like a promissory note), but it is still an IOU. The LN IOUs just sounds like a better IOU: a promise to pay that can be enforced in a easier, faster and cheaper way than going to court to enforce the offchain offline IOUs we have now in the economy.

You're thinking about IOU in a bad or pejorative way. I'm not saying LN is bad because it trades IOU, it can be great. It is just what it is."
"> able to transact without third parties, on a decentralized, distributed, immutable ledger

That is not true any more.  

The bitcoin protocol replaces the trusted central authority with a network of miners.  These were expected to be thousands of independent anonymous people, with at least half of them interested only in maximizing their revenue. That assumption was essential to justify Satoshi claim that the system was ""decentralized"" and would work as intended.   

In particular, since (in his assumption) each miner controlled only a small fraction of the hashpower, and could not conspire with other miners, his optimal strategy was to carefully validate all blocks and transactions, and mine on top of the valid branch that had the most apparent work.   If a majority of the miners (counted by hashpower) behaved in this way, then the network would be self-sustaining, self-correcting, and immune to any malicious minority of miners. 

However, today 70% of the mining power is in the hands of six Chinese pools.  They are not anonymous, not independent, and  we have seen them sit together, several times, to decide on changes to the protocol motivated by long-range plans and political considerations.  

Recall, for example, when Peter Todd convinced F2Pool (who then had 15-20% of the hashpower) to implement ""full unsafe"" RBF, before the pool understood the implications of it?  Or the DDoS attacks against pools that were too slow to approve SegWit?

Bitcoin now is more centralized than then international banking system.  Even Visa is more decentralized: it is not a monolithic company, but only an intermediary between the banks that issue credit cards and the banks that pay the merchants, tied to them by exacting contracts; so it cannot quite do what it wants.  

> You cannot refute years of development

There have been many changes to the code and the protocol, but the network has not become significantly better for users (even if one ignores BTC and looks only at BCH.  Since Gavin and Mike have been thrown out of the window, bitcoin has had no competent software developers.  It has been in the hands of amateur hackers, who think they are great developers because they can invent clever hacks like SegWit -- with no regard for their technical burden, risks, and (lack of) utility for users.

> and the community behind it

The community consists almost entirely of three classes of people:  ""drug buyers"", ""bitcoin investors"", and ""operators"".  

The drug buyers (and other people who use bitcoin for illegal payments) do not give a damn about centralization.  They use bitcoin, in spite of its clunkiness and the absurd fees and delays, only because the miners are not (yet) subject to KYC/AML, and thus bitcoin is the only ""international bank"" that they can use.

The ""bitcoin investors"" (that includes hodlers and day-traders) generally do not really care about usability or decentralization either.  They only care about the price going up (hodlers) or trashing about like crazy (day-traders).  They keep hodling and trading bitcoin because they are basically gambling addicts, and do not mind the odds being against them and the expected gain being strongly negative, as long as the promised prizes are large enough.  

And the ""operators"" (which include miners, mining rig makers, exchange and fund operators, BATM makers and operators, bitcoin entrepreneurs, and all sort of scammers and swindlers) do not care for usability or decentralization either, because they know that the ""bitcoin investors"" are dumb and they will believe any stories that promise to make them rich, like ""Visa-level adoption with the LN"", ""digital gold"", ""world's reserve currency"", etc..  They continue to run and promote bitcoin because they are pocketing at least 50 million USD every day from the stupid ""bitcoin investors"" and stupid VC investors."
Hehe, we learn that the true bitcoin behaves like a hydra. Try to control any head of it and you'll get smashed.
It's such a beautiful thing, it's breath taking when contemplated.
