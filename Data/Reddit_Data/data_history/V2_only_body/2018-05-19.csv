"Names are sound and smoke"", it says in Goethe's Faust I. 
In decentralized systems, users should take over control. And the responsible people maintaining the system must be willing to give up control to the users.
Users must be front and center of any decentralized system.
So, when the majority of the users call a coin only ""Bitcoin"", just for the sake of simplicity, than it is the ""real Bitcoin"". 
Thats a very long way to go. Keep on improving your coin, put the interests of the users in front and center of all you do, and then maybe over time, a fork of Bitcoin became just ""Bitcoin"".
But maybe, if the communities of the different bitcoin forks continue the pointless infighting, an other coin will emerge and take over the dominant position then maybe next to nobody will care about the old ""Bitcoin"".

Your mom thought bcash was bitcoin
Is this what Bitcoin Core call... Bplus?

FL will never be the FL of the east coast.
I guess technically but who thinks of Florida when they hear East Coast? More like the south to me
"Im actually surprised it got approved.  I have had the stupidest shit denied by the California license plate people for the stupidest reasons on earth.  F BANKS was one I tried for, and my explanation was:  ""Favorite Author"".  That didn't fly lol ..."

You are just luck man!  Even though I’m not a BCH fan, I do recognize a good plate when I see one. 
By wallet ID I meant the public one
"Damn, Florida should move to the East Coast. 
"

How do feel when people see your car that says bitch please? Like a big man? Some people will always remember you as the bitch please car guy. And when bitcoin cash you dies you will be remembered as the crypto con-guy. Not a great legacy. 
“Rob me, PLS!”

This is the best reason I've seen to support BCH.
Would BCH LOL be available? If anyone reads this and gets such license plate, just let me know
Very Kanye plate 
Why does NY have the yellow license plates. So ugly, they stick out like a sore thumb

u r so cool
I'm surprised they allowed it to be honest.
He does what he wants..
I think that's intentionally the point actually, NY picked that scheme because it's high contrast and stands out.
Add another for bitch please 
Thanks!
At some point we have to be more open about crypto and stop hiding it like you're facing imminent hack. It just takes a little bit of work on your part and your crypto is just as secure as you're fiat. It's like saying to someone with a lambo, might as well put your checking account and routing on your window.
New York also?
"Yeah he's actually begging for BCH - pls.
"
Bitch, Please
Haha you got it, bro!
[deleted]
also surprised.  very.  what about photoshop?
I found BTC HODL in the wild. That was interesting.
Which would take about 3 seconds in New York. What a shit state.

This comment literally almost made me pee myself 😂

With that car, I don’t think anyone should be that worried.
