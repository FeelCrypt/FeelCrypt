You see transactions. Those can be verified and correlated with other transactions you know he made so you know it was his address. Nobody knows if his private key was compromised. The FBI was after him for some time. You can't know if they or somebody else hacked his PC (we know they hacked the servers) and took his key to make some transactions and have proof. Besides you can not verify the logs. Thus you have no way to know what those payments have been for, IF he made them by himself. Anything digital I consider not proof enough to charge someone x years in prison. It's to easy to fake such 'proofs' and there are dozens of reasons why the FBI as an institution or people working for the FBI would fake evidence. We know that multiple of the FBI personal in charge of the operation have dirt on their shoulders and are in fact in prison now. Why would anyone believe any evidence they came up with? In any democratic country Ross would either be free by now because he has broken no law or because there have been MAJOR issues with the process and evidence OR he'd get a rather mild sentence (5-10 years) for e.g. providing a platform without any regulation (which is a crime in most modern countries). But 2x life sentence? Saying he's responsible for deaths of children? That's a fucking joke and anyone who doesn't see that this was staged must be nuts.
Funny, I don't see that charge. When was he convicted of that? I assume there is a lot of evidence if the government is willing to state that publicly to turn the public against him before charging him.

"This has nothing to do with the charges being dismissed, this is about people that have no law degree weighing in on what entrapment is. 

Also funny how people want to hold up the court as proof of innocence when something is dismissed but when Ross was convicted they immediately called BS.

You can't have it both ways where you use a judgement as fact when it fits your argument and then say the system is rigged when it doesn't fit your argument."
How so? Forcing those big politican drug dealers out of business?
Yup, did you?
">Meanwhile we have an opiate and meth epidemic on our hands.

I agree with most of what you said, but this one is naive on your part. Big pharma and their cronies in congress are to blame for the opioid crisis. If anything, Silkroad and the sites that followed were a great way to get **safe** drugs. It was never easier to buy high quality shit at an affordable price. For internet-savvy drug users, there was the time before DNMs and after DNMs...and whatever limbo we are in right now (RIP AlphaBay)  "
Then you should advocate charging executives of the pharmaceutical industry with crimes against humanity, because they are what is really fueling the opioid crisis. If people had access to safe plant based medicines, they wouldn't need opioids to deal with their pain. This whole system is set up to keep the actual unpatentable medicines away from the people who need them most in order to keep them hooked on patentable pharmaceutical drugs. The biggest drug dealers in the world are Big Pharma and they keep the government in their back pocket to suppress competition. That's why they went so hard on Ross.
Not sure how this adds to this discussion. Either way: seems like silk road is not the only subject you have no idea about.
To discredit him and continue the profitable drug war that is proven more harmful than not. He provided a safe way to purchase drugs. That's a threat to the U.S. Government.
Those things did carry crypto for the longest time. Personally I don't believe in any coin that couldn't reliably be used for illegal commerce. It's the ultimate trial by fire for usability and privacy-
"> if you think helping this guy is good for the market you're delusional, period.

SR1 is what made the market.  He's why it went from $8 a coin that was only for geeks, to $200 a coin that actually had a market use case.

> those would be terrible headlines for us reenforcing the notion crypto is for dope dealers, hitmen, and pimps. 

Good.  Fuck public perception.  Money must be able to be used as money, that's what it's for.  If people can't handle that there are bad people in the world, they can stay in their homes and hide.  Bitcoin is free market money, which comes with good and bad.  If you don't understand that, then it isn't for you.  Bitcoin was built by and for the cypherpunks and cryptoanarchists.  The only reason the rest of the world likes it is because we've proven that it does actually work.  if they don't like our methods and our world, then they are free to ""cash out"" and not use it.  The world can be a scary place."
Drug seekers are going to seek drugs. He provided a safe way to do so. He didn't invent drugs, he just removed the dangerous street element. It was actually safer with the site up.

"Sure, buy bad drugs, risk dying. The benefit of silkroad compared to the normal process of buying drugs is that there's less risk involved. Buyer reviews the seller based on quality of the product and other factors. Users would often have their drugs purity tested and report back in the form of a review. 


You never get this with a in-person drug deal and thus the risks are much greater. The highest selling drugs on silk road were weed and purity-tested psychedelics, whereas in street deals the dealer usually tries to get people into more addictive and deadly drugs like meth and heroin, which again shows another benefit of online platforms such as silk road.


Edit: Still not sure why you're comparing him to pablo"
Some of them should be probably.
Everyone in this thread is a lawyer now. Where'd you get your law degree, University of Phoenix?
They didn't believe the evidence of him doing those things was strong enough to charge him with those crimes. If there was sufficient evidence to convict him of those charges then they would have charged and convicted him of ut

I agree. It should have been a mistrial. But innocent until proven guilty is only a legal thing doesn't have to exist is the court of public opinion. People here are so quick to defend him morally because of this argument and because he liked a crypto currency they like.
I'm saying it's not in our interest for him to get clemency
"So what if he helped the market grow in the past?

How is that relevant

And no people will never be able to handle it. We need to become mainstream before some fucking muslim uses crypto to buy explosives and we're set back decades"
">here are risks, too, such as exit scams

You can't compare the risk of losing some money in an exit scam to the risk of losing your life to a middleman who cuts his produce with toxic shit. Besides, you always have the risk of losing money, even on the street. "
"I didn't compare him to Pablo, that was someone else.

All of your claimed benefits are circumstantial.  There are risks, too, such as exit scams, which happened quite a bit from what I read.

Point still stands: he knew exactly what he was doing and there are far more effective and socially positive ways to improve drug culture than breaking every law and pocketing millions.  His paper-thin moral crusade was just his own bullshit excuse so he could sleep at night.  "
You're making it sound like greed is illegal in America. If anything, it's the one sin that even conservatives seem to celebrate.  Also why are you in crypto? Not out of greed? I'd lie if I said greed plays no role in my motivation to stay in the game.
Spoken like a true socialist.
dude enough with your bullshit already
A text file as proof of murder. Nice. Guess what .log I just found on my disk. Hint: JFK.
Why didn't they charge him? Educate me then. I'm open minded.
And yours?
"You understand the charges being dismissed would have taken place in a court of law with lawyers and a judge present right? You know... people with law degrees?

You can cut the /r/iamverysmart snarkiness. "
There were no murders because he was taking to a DEA agent. You can go read the transcripts. 
Agreed. But in the US we have a philosophy innocent until proven guilty. And in Ross' case, corrupt enforcement SHOULD corrupt the case against him. However, a double standard is being held and this is what concerns so many people that live in the US. 
Well said
It was censored and manipulated for years. People believed a perceived authority because Bitcoin was too complicated to understand. Since the fork we can point to actual facts and evidence.
Well it's just that bch is better Bitcoin

Appeared to be entrapment.
Nice fallacy bro
"Depends on the drug. Weed? I don't think that should be illegal. Heroin and opiates that are fueling a national crisis? Absolutely.

There are some drugs that I absolute do not want in the community and I would gladly see people who facilitate or sell heroin in prison forever. They offer nothing to the world."
/u/cryptochecker check
My understanding is that he wasn’t the only person with access to the DRP account as it was logged into after he was taken into custody.  
"Yes. And those weren't emails, they were private messages ""found"" by said FBI agents on the Silkroad forums some time after the website was acquired by the FBI. Also, give the messages a read, and make your own judgment but they're just stupid fake.

For example, why in the hell would this, as ""Ross"" says, be something that happens every now and then in his position. His position as host for a dark net drug vendor market site... He never bought or sold drugs, he was merely a host for the site and made fees. Nothing sketchy on that level is going to happen. I've watched and participated on these websites' forums, this conversation is just not based in reality. How he also advertised to that guy to be a vendor was just strange.

And Lucydrop was just a popular vendor, I remember him. How the hell would Lucydrop have gotten malware and why would Lucydrop have information about other vendors at all? Lucydrop was a big vendor who supplied his own LSD and there'd be no discernible reason to have info on other vendors, much less info that malware would be able to access.

I would love for all the forum messages to be compiled and re-investigated, and see all the messages that have ever been sent on the forum, just to see how far from reality this series of messages was."
Who got murdered?
"Are [these e-mail messages](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations) fabricated? Has Ross directly denied having written them, or did he offer some other sort of explanation?

Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-bitcoin and anti-drug prohibition, so I definitely wish for Ross's freedom if all he did was facilitate voluntary exchanges. But I am not pro-ordering hits on people who are getting in your way..."
Just because they were corrupt and wanted to make some extra cash doesn't 100 percent mean they faked the hitman stuff
His crime is that he ran a site that needed serious opsec, and then made serious opsec mistakes.
Serious question: Can you post this petition to r/bitcoin? I would but I'm banned. Someone?
Free Hat
Law enforcement should be the job of everyone who operates a website.  
"Where was the trail for that murder? Ive yet to see an indictment for murder be sidelined for anything else when trying to convict someone, especially if evidence is there.

"
Nobody deserves life in prison for non-violent crimes. This is a horrifying miscarriage of Justice. 
That doesn't justify it.
Too soon for clemency. That said, eventually maybe. But really it's too soon given the obvious intent.
"What is he now, a fortune teller where he could predict his sentencing being this ridiculous?

Get real.. 

Also, that's not the point, stop trying to deviate the topic. Lets say he did know. What are we supposed to say at the end of the day ""all is fine, and this is the way things are, no use even disagreeing internally with it ourselves?""

Use your brain."
The problem with that story was that the evidence was essentially some logs on a server that was in the hands of the two guys that late stole all those bitcoins. They could have all sorts of motives to make stories up and had full access to the server.
"Got some screenshots of those hitman contracts on the SR marketplace? I did a quick search and didn't come up with anything, which no longer makes me wonder if the hitman claims were exaggerated, but if there was any truth that that at all. Here is my search. I skimmed the first few only, maybe you can do better?

[https://www.google.com/search?q=silk+road+hitman+marketplace+screenshot](https://www.google.com/search?q=silk+road+hitman+marketplace+screenshot&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDhpjruKDcAhVP7lQKHVoDCAgQsAQIJg&biw=1280&bih=653#imgrc=iQiy7tMfF-7-FM:)"
"No he didn't he was accused of hiring a hitman who didn't exist to kill a person who also didn't exist.

Something he was never actually charged with and has nothing to do with his sentence."
He ran an ebay style site where drugs and whores congregated. He personally was not involved in any of it. The differences could not be more extreme. 
He wasn't involved in selling, creating or distributing drugs or kill anyone, for starter.
No. That want part of the conviction at all.
nobody cares about what you think
The court records are public you can look it up if you don't believe me.  
Where's the evidence for this? These posts seem increasingly disingenuous.
":tinfoilhat:

it's not that ""irrational"" when you consider the US is the worlds biggest drugs dealer (legal & illegal) AND the worlds largest drug consumer

Ulbritch was hitting their profit line, and would've taken more

:trickedyouwiththetinfoilhatthisshitislegit:"
It is unethical what they have done to Ross , support organizations like [https://americanblackcross.org/](https://americanblackcross.org/)
"The fact that America is willing to throw a guy like Ross in a cage for life just shows what a failure the USA has become.

">where individual users chose what to list for sale

Problem is admins had to configure the categories. There's no plausible deniability.

>an e-commerce platform similar to eBay

eBay has made many decisions about products they will not allow to be listed, as they understand culpability.

I totally agree that his sentencing is ridiculous, but there are a LOT of criminals in prison who were involved in the drug trade that weren't the final dealers. We should look to those cases for consideration of what would be fair sentencing, at least until laws change (and those many who are incarcerated are released before our favorite white male nerd is)"
"In this thread....

Person: didn't he hire a Hitman?

Ross fan boy: nah bro, that was dismissed so it definitely didn't happen

Person: isn't the whole argument in this thread that the courts rulings are bullshit and not representative of what he actually did 

Ross fan boy: nah bro, he just created a website on godaddy and they threw the book at him"
He knew the risks going in.  
"Fuck that kangaroo court.

The trial was a sham to begin with."
I don't know if he was convicted of the hit he put out....but didn't he try (and believed) he had at least one, if not two, person(s) killed?
Shit sentences like this should be illegal. It is not based on any crimes he committed, but rather is meant to send a message that drugs and other shit sold are bad. Think about that for a second: some pig-headed judge is destroying a man's life to prove a point. That is the justice system we are working with here. It was a white-collar crime and yes, he should be punished for it, but this is just a gross overstep of justice. 
Oh right, you like...Couldn't hire a hitman there or anything jerks...
He paid someone to kill his partner when he thought he had robbed him! Was it a set up by an undercover agent? Yes. But he still thought he was getting someone killed. He belongs in jail as much as perverts who think they're about to bang a 13 year old only to realize it was an FBI agent all along. 
"""for a website""

"I'm all for crypto, but come one guys, he tried to have six people murdered. He's not our hero.

How is this guy any different from Pablo Escobar or El Chapo? 
He's serving because he was trying to kill people.  Silk Road was fine until he hired a narc to do his killing. 
I’ve never shed a single tear for Ross, he deserved it.
One of you morons says this in EVERY Ross post.
Here was never convicted of anything of the sort. There was no trial for that.

That’s what I meant thanks 
And yet the makers of Oxycontin are completely innocent of taking lives because their product is prescribed by MDs?
"> the same corrupt FBI agents that got prosecuted themselves for stealing money during the investigation

That fact wasn't allowed in his defense either."
same to you loser. 
It's the reason he got caught
"Setting up a marketplace for the sale and distribution of illegal drugs easily qualifies.  He also made a lot of money from the site.   Meanwhile we have an opiate and meth epidemic on our hands.  To think the drugs this guy had a hand in getting out there didn't ruin lives is the most naive white boy libertarian fantasy I've ever heard of.  

He knew the risks (why he went to such lengths to hide) and he got caught.  He's done.  Fuck him.  Find a new crypto currency messiah."
Do you think most drug king pins are standing on a corner slinging drugs?
Yeah cause it's totally normal to pay 1670 BTC for fake murders.

You forgot to add that the people that accused him, where themselves arrested and convicted of stealing Bitcoin. And that at least one of them appears to have been trying to infiltrate MtGox when hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin went missing from the exchange. 
ooo
But Ross didn't have a motive to eliminate someone that threatened his massive wealth? It's certainly suspect but this doesn't mean everything else is fake. We have no way of knowing.

"Yes it does. Having the two communities actually communicate more would likely make that happen faster.

The new people who see BTC as the default might notice the lowers transaction fees, and more places to spend BCH if they hear from each other more, and not only look to places where opinion is controlled by censorship."
There are many ways to disagree internally. We could crowdfund a DPR statue in Belize or something. 
The thing is, the only evidence of that was testimony by, and evidence handed over from, the two agents who were blackmailing him and stealing from him.  So most of us who have researched it and who were on SR1 when it was around are pretty sure that's just a smear campaign.  Remember, he was never charged with any of that.  But of course the judge used it as basis for justification of his long sentence.
Then charge and convict him of those crimes. 
Yes but let's not get facts in the way. I'm sick of this scumbag being posted on this subreddit and it managing to get to the front page. There are actual people in jail right now that haven't committed a crime but no one here gives two fucks about those people.
"He was caught *in the United States* *at a public library* with *his laptop* *on and logged in*.

I mean it doesn't seem wealth was ever his main motivation. Anyway you can always find motives, that doesn't make any proof
Not so friend. 
"No need to crowdfund anything. I'm sitting at 0 Karma for this post, while the person I reply to sits at 6.

Speaks louder than any words people's overall sentiment, or mental capacity to even understand what the discussion is even about. I suppose witty one-liners attempting to explain away such a ridiculous situation is something that holds grasp over people more than actually thinking about an event, or situation as serious as this topic."
Bitcoin-BTC is a implementation of Bitcoin the protocol, but Bitcoin Cash BCH is the only remaining chain that follows the definition of Bitcoin. I'd say both have a stake to the name, BTC through their constant media marketing as Bitcoin, BCH by definition.
And yet there are hundreds of thousands of people in similar situations.
