Very expected considering that their the only ones mining this garbage.
A valid point.
"Over the last 2 to 3 years there has been a split in the community. A civil war of sorts about what is the best way to scale. No one was giving an inch and it got very nasty.

It was unhealthy for everyone. Nothing was getting done.

This is like the divorce papers finally being signed. Hopefully people can get back to more productive things than just fighting and bickering."
"Depends who you ask whether it's good or not. Personally, I like it, it's what I signed up for years ago when I got on the BTC train... one currency for everything, no middlemen. The core team seems very intent on adding middle layers (with accompanying middlemen) for reasons that don't add up on a technical level (in my opinion). And they're in the habit of deleting dissenting opinion on /r/Bitcoin, so that just adds to the distrust.

What it means is still unknown - it might result in two competing currencies, but more likely people will jump ship from one to the other once it's clear there is a winner - being a bitcoin miner on the losing chain is  bad for a lot of complicated reasons."
I get the first part now, but can you elaborate on the chain being reorganized? 
Good do it. We need to give our miners free fees
Incorrect. Miners are free to choose the accepted levels of fees.
"No. Such blocks would be rejected by excessive/soft limits and even if they weren't they would propagate slowly.

Larger blocks also make it much more expensive to spam because rather than just block the last 10kb of capacity you have to pay fees for several mb of transactions."

Sorry if this is a dumb question but what does this mean for the bitcoin community and why is it such a good thing?
There was more than 1 megabyte in the mempool, that it cleared on the first block means that it was a successful hardfork. Also that the chain can't be reorganized. 
As long as the mempool is being emptied, it is a sign it probably isn't an attack and it's working as planned.  Back to the way Bitcoin used to be and was meant to be, fast confirmation times for everyone (who uses BCH)

"""Where else?"""

I personally care much more about how the system works on a technical/consensus level than the economics of it. I'd be fine with messing with the supply of coins, and would likely follow the longest/most hashed chain.
IMO the longest chain is more important than the size of the blocks, although I do think that stopping tx malleability is pretty important.

"> 3.7 MB if you use all of an entirely different type of transaction

Yes, it's called multisig.  

> So your ""fact"" is very distorted

It's not distorted at all.  It's a normal fact.  The maximum size of a block is a round 3.7mb.  I don't know why you're getting your panties in a knot over this.  Yes, the average size will likely be around 1.7mb once high adoption is achieved.

You seem to want to argue with me, but you're not actually disputing anything I've said."
This new altcoin isn't bitcoin.  But I wish you luck.  I seem to have a nice stack of Bcash tokens now myself, so I hope it does well.
How is this relevant.  The claim was that segwit had a *maximum* block of 1.7mb.  That is factually incorrect.
Or practical or worthwhile.
Whatever the number, it's still 3.7mb of data.  It would still take 4 blocks without segwit.

That's assuming somebody will mine on top of your block. Unless you are a very powerful miner everybody else could act against you.
"It fixes transaction malleability; transaction ids can be changed by others right now.

This makes life difficult for developers of bitcoin applications (including wallets). Although most applications are theoretically possible without this fix, it makes them very complex and thus difficult and more risky. 

Payment channels and sidechains are one of the things that are easier with this fix. There are more applications that are already invented on paper, or with some code, and probably many not yet invented. All easier with this fix.

I am a developer and see how this fix helps future  innovation. Not everything has been invented yet. This is the internet in 1997. SegWit supports innovation because it gives developers more freedom to build new things.

There may also be disadvantages though, but I don't know any except that current software has to adjust and becomes slightly more complex in some way."
"nice!  that just means the network functions as expected finally, thanks!

(and by that that means ANY transaction submitted to the network that has ANY fee is 100% not spam, they are paying for the transaction)"
"That seemed like a rhetorical question.

Yes, it's quite centralized at the moment, numbnuts. It's a brand new fork that is literally unprofitable to mine right now. Everybody who mines it does it out of pocket and purely because they believe in it.

">How I know a bigger blocksize is not the reason why there are few miners mining on this unprofitably high difficulty on this new fork? Hmm, I know that because miner support for bigger blocks has always been overwhelming, have you somehow missed that? Where you on vacation for the last year?

The above is known as *speculation*.

I also noticed that you skipped the operative question.

Shocker.

>Is BCH mining completely centralized at the moment, or not?"
You proved my point.  1.7mb is average, not maximum.  This is all I was pointing out.
"Do you know what the word ""maximum"" even means?"
"Well thank  you anyways.

Crazy how so many bitcoin history bits are already gone."
The awesomeness. 
The point is, if his works while the segregated chain doesnt, this is bitcoin and the other chain will die as it cannot compete, when that happens bitcoin will be the longest chain of p2p txs
Well no worries then! A malleability fix is on the roadmap for BitcoinCash :)
"I suppose valid is in the eye of the beholder.

I hope we all agree that any tx that are not signed properly would be grounds to invalidate a block, or spending outputs that have already been spent."
"and when people mine empty blocks Bitcoin was doing 0tps

tps is not the only measure and is only really effective when looking at a time span of at least a few blocks

the biggest point of all you are glazing over is all the transactions waiting were cleared from the network in 1 block, where the same transactions would have taken 2 or more blocks before

once the difficulty/network adjusts over the next few days the network will be able to do that every 10 minutes, large block or empty block it will all average out to a much stronger and scaleable network as originally designed with the CAPABILITY of doing 24tps, whereas BS coin will only do MAYBE 3tps for at least 90 days and MAYBE get 6tps after that forever (and no, SW transactions are not Bitcoin transactions so the network tps does not apply to SW transactions.  And since SW bloats the chain the block size can never really be raised anywhere even close to 8M blocks)"

That would be a huge issue.   Hope not.
"https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/uahf/#2h

Looks pretty empty to me..."
yes, these transactions were retained in case of a reorg but they'll never be committed now.  A restart will clear them out, or you can just wait for them to time out...
"The 1.7MB ""claim"" was based on the miners test net article: the Bitfury analytics team’s research concluded that 1.7 MB was the average block size based on their experiment conducted on the bitcoin testnet.

""More importantly, WhalePanda noted that 1.7 MB is theoretical and other numbers such as 2.1 MB or Lightning co-author Thaddeus Dryja’s 3.7 MB are also all hypothetical. The only issue with Segwit which the miners, especially the Chinese mining community struggles to deal with, is that it can’t guarantee a specific block size due to a wide range of variables including different transaction types and circumstances.""

 https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/segwit-testnet-supports-1-7-mb-blocks-8800-transactions/

And it would still take 4 blocks with Segwit.  Though, I know, you are only going to send Segwit transactions as soon as that is possible, in a year or two, maybe.

>Larger blocks also make it much more expensive to spam because rather than just block the last 10kb of capacity you have to pay fees for several mb of transactions.

Maybe. Fees should plummet so it may even out. Plus the effect of such an attack is orders of magnitude worse than on Bitcoin. 10KB of extra bloat per block vs. several megabytes."
Yeah, but you've probably learned to spell your username by now. That's something.

Of course, as the other person pointed out, over here we have up ti 8mb Bitcoin blocks."

BiTcoin Cash - works for me.
"It's a coin with incontrovertible heritage, making it descendant rather than merely ""alt"" as r/segwitcoin folk would like to label it. After all, in what way is it ""not really"" BTC anymore? Because it has bigger blocks? Many would argue that makes it precisely BTC relative to its competitor."
"Have you ever read the bitcoin whitepaper?

Nows a good time to try"
Close enough for most of us to want to talk about it. Who gives a shit? Its a potential scaling solution. We can talk about segwit2x here too.
It doesnt need to mean anything just accept it for what it is!
Yes, the temporary limit he told us to raise before blocks got full, that's the one.
If the majority hashpower chain decided one day to mine an extra hundred million coins, would you still like that coin or would you switch to a minority chain that still maintained the 21 million limit? It's the same basic thing - the rules of the chain are more important than how big some arbitrary number attached to the blocks are.
So what you're saying is in the future you won't hate it, interesting.
The white paper also said that you should follow the longest valid chain. Saying a chain is invalid b/c block 478559 < 1mb in size is pretty strange. It was reasonable in practice.

bottom line mempool cleared in one block without a problem and the next block has shown us the FUD about always full blocks if we raise the block size is just that, FUD"
"Block 1 emptied the mempool of all pre-fork transactions.

Very few people are sending transactions because they want to let the dust settle first, so there are hardly any in the mempool

"Hello /r/all. For several years Bitcoin has been facing an issue with increasing it's capacity to handle transactions. The community has been locked in a stalemate on how to progress for about three years. There are two visions for Bitcoin's future. One is to allow more transactions to be processed on the blockchain every ten minutes. The other is to add some functionality to move the transactions off the blockchain.

Block 478559 was the first bitcoin block to allow more transactions to be processed every ten minutes on the blockchain. It signifies the two competing ideas going separate ways. The scaling via off-chain transactions camp does not recognize this block as valid, and the scaling on-chain transactions camp have this transaction to mark the beginning of their strategy. 

Many people, especially on /r/btc, think this is a return to the philosophy behind Bitcoin. Most people who watch the Bitcoin space are relieved that the debate could finally be over. The only question that remains is which blockchain will succeed. 

I don't think either will fail, but I think they will be useful to different classes of users. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will be for individuals who don't want government/bank/etc involvement in their money, and Bitcoin Core (BTC) will probably be useful to banks and large companies."
Commenting for historic moment. Congrats guys!
Exodus Block!
No matter what happens to BCH, this clean hard fork puts the lie to blockstream and core developers endless statements that it will take -- what was it, 6 months to a year? -- to execute a hard fork.
No matter the side you are on, this is a historic moment for bitcoin and crypto.

"This right here, this is the start of something great, nothing short of an amazing effort by the bitcoin community.

Now that the fork has happened, I should have coins on both sides because I kept control of my own keys in an offline wallet right? How do I dump either side of my coins for the other?

"Bitcoin has split into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, split along the lines of scaling up the payment technology; Core wants BTC as a settlement layer with other stuff doing small transactions (think bank wires and then smaller transactions via ATMs) and Cash wants BTC to operating purely as one layer (everything is done in BTC proper). Following both ideas requires a hard split."

I am in favour of SegWit and a block increase in the near future. Will still run a Core node (sorry) for now, but that does not mean I am not happy to see a fork like this happen because a lot of people want it. I believe Bitcoin is designed to work like this.

I hope this makes it clear that not everyone is in a camp, and that even people who do like SegWit can be happy with this fork."
Epic failure lol
#epicfail
finally can dump this altcoin garbage. Thanks miners!!
If you had bitcoins, you could get the same amount of Bitcoin Cash, a new version that removes the temporary capacity limit of 1 MB per 10 minutes, so you can actually spend your coins without paying high transaction fees. 
XXXalio was here. One for history.
This is true.  If *nothing* else is learned from this, we now know that hard forks can execute very cleanly without years of development and testing (which, of course, Core still hasn't started work on).
"If you've ever read the explanatory specification for bitcoin knows as the whitepaper, you would know that bitcoin was designed for situations like this.

If you had bitcoin you still do, it just works again."
Just sold 30% of my BCH for BTC on Kraken, cool =)
Bitcoin working as it was always meant to! Congratulations to all those who made this happen, what a milestone :)
This is how bitcoin should work
Commenting for proof for my future grandchildren.
The HF will never happen. Blockstream has no intention to further the use of BTC, only to prevent it from harming the establishment. BCC is the future! 
I always understood it as time needed for everyone being on board, updating their software in time and preventing a chain split. I don't think anyone meant 12 month are needed, if you are willingly splitting the chain.
And yet /u/nullc still won't admit he is wrong, that's why everyone knows they  can't trust him.
Agreed, though the ETH hard fork was also a watershed moment to be fair. 
Honestly- I don't understand what all the fuss was about.  I think both sides had good points, and I think this compromise and fork was frankly, great!  
clean so far. Id be more concerned with segw
I'm on the side of not knowing what this means, someone explain pls?
"A small faction of the community who basically spend 95% of the time trolling the core developers of bitcoin, forked off bitcoin, created a new coin called, imaginatively ""bitcoin cash"".

Didn't everyone already know this from ETC?

You mean a ~2MB was able to be broadcast and handled properly by a network dramatically smaller than the pre-fork network without issue?  Mind blown.

As for the price, I'd say most people don't have any clue that there was a chain split. It is mostly people that keep up with this stuff that know what is going on. I've seen very little mention of what is going on outside of places that are focused on cryptocurrencies."

One day you will realize that miners being money hungry is what makes bitcoin work.
Miners being money hungry is the very foundation of bitcoin's security. It's one of the most brilliant aspects of the design: Rely on humans being greedy.
I also think the total value of coins held by people with no interest in BCC is greater than that held by BCC fans, but the trading ratio works in their favor. At a 10% ratio, every BTC coin somelike a Roger Ver sells buys 10 BCC. So there will be a stable point, and it may well be in the hundreds of dollars per BCC.

One side shunned and censored science, it's hard to compromise with the 
Too much animosity at this point. It's not driven by facts and logic but emotion. SegWit2x attempted a compromise and both the Core and Cash sides mock it. At least it's likely to activate SegWit on the Bitcoin chain, anyway.
">Segwit is a much more radical change than a block size increase.

I'll give you that. It is however far more thoroughly tested and an opt-in feature. If SegWit transactions scare you, don't use them, and you'll still gain the benefit of increased transaction capacity since others using it will free up base block capacity.

If you want to talk about radical changes, how about making consensus changes to your hard fork days before the fork occurs? Where is the testing, exactly? 

>created and pushed by a single corp on a centralized highly censored forum

SegWit has [widespread adoption](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/) across the entire bitcoin ecosystem.

It's truly ironic you say that on one of the many arms of Roger Ver's mini empire. More than half of the links in the sidebar go to Ver operated domains. This is the definition of a controlled narrative."
Push transactions onto trustless off-chain systems that can be settled to the bitcoin blockchain at any point, yes. This is a good thing! You'll never compete on-chain with centralized systems in transaction volume or cost while maintaining a decentralized, censorship resistant blockchain.
They normally mine Zcash etc, but at 160 watts each they're not money making anyway - I'm just having fun with them.

"https://www.viabtc.com/quot/realtime?currency=btc&dest=bcc&chart=simple

See the invisible hand that kept the price higher than 0.1 pre-fork? As viabtc is almost the only pool+exchange behind BCC, I believe it's viabtc itself behind this price fixing. And it takes money to do this. At least if someone wants to sell and withdraw they will have to shell out the real money (BTC), as long as they can afford to do so."
"I certainly don't know everything.  

Based on my personal analysis, the main motivator against segwit was the loss of profits associated with losing AsicBoost on the Chinese farms.  That loss of profit would have been very tough to deal with, and the Chinese decided they would take control and develop a system where they can continue to reap large profits on transactions.  "
Then what happens when the coins run out?  
I agree that it will stabilize, the question on my mind is how to make money during that process. I intent to hold long after it settles (although, honestly, I'm not sure it's better than other alts at this point, but we'll see)
"> Bitcoin was cheap and fast

Lightning network transactions are cheap and *instant*, and just as secure as bitcoin transactions.

To me, Bitcoin's primary attributes are decentralization and censorship resistance. I don't see how you'll ever maintain those attributes while trying to compete with centralized systems on-chain.

Second layer systems built on top of Bitcoin give the best of both worlds."
"Please define peer to peer, then. I can send USD to any PayPal user.

How big must blocks be to accommodate worldwide adoption? 1GB? 10GB? Bigger? Do you think Bitcoin will remain decentralized and peer to peer at that point?"
I feel like this is the worst thing which could have happened. I don't understand how people don't notice that this could be a problem for both parts.
"I am OK with Bitcoin (now called Bitcoin Cash) *merely* replacing wire transfer transactions the average person rarely bothers with. I agree that a distributed system is not ideal for things like cups of coffee.

segwit specifically gives a *discount* to off-chain transactions. Bitcoin cash does not prohibit such a settlement layer, but does not encourage it either.

Right on, thank you!
The replay protection was added as a miner-enforced softfork, it's no longer optional. 
wat
Sure, if you can assume that any change is the result of miners switching over.
Still no block, indeed. 
The estimated hash rate is like 1-2% of the main chain, so on average we would expect the next block to be mined in like 8-16 hours.

"They're using equihash which is memory bound. When Zcash supporters say ""ASIC resistant"" they mean they don't believe people will waste money developing equihash ASICs suitable for zcash due to the heavy memory requirements.

It's also what the Zcash team basically says (https://z.cash/blog/why-equihash.html). They also state that they would change the PoW if flaws in equihash or algorithms other than equihash are developed which offer better assurances against custom hardware (ASICs).

"> the BCC chain will wait here for a > 1MB block

To be clear, the wait is for a block that meets the difficulty criteria, not for sufficient transactions to exceed 1MB.  If there aren't enough transactions, useless scripts will be added to reach the size threshold.

"Yes that would be as bullish as hell. Someone throwing hash at BCC good or bad says they are trying to create or destroy value.

The common denominator is both actions confirm BCC has value. "
because nobody has created one
If no specific signaling was being made before the fork, the only way to measure it now would be counting how many blocks are generated over a period of time. No BCC block has yet been generated, so...
Hash power is estimated based on rate of blocks mined.

"Bitcoin Cash is the more conservative fork.

The segwit fork is trying to push off-chain transactions with an artificially limited block size.

"Aah well. I just looked at was most profitable for my gear a month ago. Dunno much about Zcash other than it has transactions with the option to hide the amount. 

It's all gone to pot since then anyway - price back to $250 instead of $500 - some miners have been put onto Stanford's folding@home instead. They're all on a button on a remote power board - turn on for heat, turn off when too warm."
"Segwit is a much more radical change than a block size increase. It also has nothing at all to do with decentralization or censorship resistance. Pretty much the opposite actually, given the politics surrounding it (created and pushed by a single corp on a centralized highly censored forum).

The ""adoption vs. decentralization"" sides don't exist. We all want both. 

"
"Is decentralization a meaningful term here? How is it measured? If network A has 100 nodes, and network B has 90 nodes, is network B 10% less ""decentralized"" than A? Is the best cryptocurrency the one with the largest number of full nodes?"

"Mining pools throw away the coinbase and replace it with their own so that code in ABC is only valuable for testing.  However, the essence of your statement (and mine) is correct.  The miners are not waiting for 1MB worth of tx -- they can easily generate their own spam.  

But it seemed to me that the OP was claiming that the BCC chain would continue to follow the BTC chain until a 1MB block was mined.  This is untrue.  The first block on the fork must be > 1MB and it must happen on the block after the MTP is greater than the fork date so we must wait for a BCC specific block to be generated."

"Your altcoin is called *Bitcoin Cash*.

You should be proud of it, rather than pretending it's something it's not."
One day you will realize you have been manipulated by money hungry miners... 
"Don't take advice from random strangers on the internet like me: but I think if people were going to sell off BTC it would already be happening. The price barely dipped, so it seems a lot of the market isn't concerned about missing out on BCH.

Now, if BCH really takes off, BTC might plummet, but that'll probably take a day or more to take effect, there's not even a single BCH block yet, and blocks are going to be this slow for many hours before the difficulty readjustment.

Personally, my strategy is more around BCH. I think most traders are taking the ""don't touch your coins"" advice right now, but I think the BCH price will tank over the next week when tons of people with zero interest in BCH are trying to sell. BCH has lots of support, but no where near as many people / as much money supporting it as there are (in my estimation) apathetic people who don't care and just want ""free money"". I think the price will continue to fall until the majority of the ""free money"" seekers have traded away their BCH, then I think it will climb again.

I'm also placing a few ridiculously low limit orders, especially for BCH as soon as I can (e.g. $10 or even $0.10), so that if someone comes on the exchange and wipes out the order sheet by making a huge sell (as happened with ETH on GDAX a while ago), I can sweep up some super cheap coins. It's unlikely to happen, but I'll be there just in case, and it's more likely to happen when the volume is super small (like it will be now). This is a tricky and risky and pain in the ass strategy though, so I wouldn't really recommend it. I'd probably recommend holding and keeping an eye on the BCH price over the next few days and scoop some up if it crashes really low.

Another useful thing to look at is the BCH / BCC futures price, e.g. here:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/

Good luck!"
Those are not mutually exclusive goals.
PayPal is an extremely usable peer-to-peer transaction system. What is it in your mind that sets Bitcoin apart?
They both seem valid approaches to me, and it looks like in the end they bring the same results. Why the need to split the currencies? Wouldn't have been easier to make a compromise?
You can't just wish away the *fact* that Bitcash is currently an altcoin.
"The market shall decide; and right now, it's clearly indicating that Bitcash is an altcoin -- regardless of how often or religiously you claim otherwise."

"I'd be pretty pissed if Intel sold chips designed to compete for block rewards that they use internally at full speed, then slow down by 30% when sold externally!

Frankly, it seems like the problem is more a centralization of mining hardware manufacture, something that isn't particularly addressed by segwit even if segwit stops the alleged asic boost."
"I'm not a member of r/bitcoin and I don't agree with their moderator.  I am a member of r/btc and appreciate the discussions and lack of censorship.

"No they are real.  

I just don't think Bitcoin Cash is actually going to solve those problems.  

By the end of the year, we will be able to see who has faster transactions and better future scaling."
At that point, only the very largest farms would be operating on such a thin profit margin, and it basically GUARANTEES that the network behind Bitcoin will be very centralized.  The system will be under the control of a very few individuals.  I prefer a more decentralized system, that allows more people to be involved.  
A wallet trusting which full node? Which is especially dangerous when you're accepting bitcoin for real world goods. Remember you can't run a full node.

"> Does not increasing the block size change the incentive structure too? The goal is cheaper transactions, which sounds like a change in the incentive structure.

Larger blocks also allow more predictable fees, since the blocks are not full. Miners will naturally avoid huge blocks with low fees due to the inherent orphan risk associated with those blocks. Large enough fees can overcome that reluctance."

No. Bitcoin was not designed with a blocksize cap. There is no mention in the whitepaper about a maximum blocksize. There is plenty of mentions of incentives however."

Or the fees would be enough to pay for the mining without being a significant proportion of the transaction costs. Bigger blocks == more transactions == more fees + greater utalization which means higher price.
growth in number of transactions * tiny fee = enough reward to secure the network

I'm not sure ASIC boost exists, but if it does, it's a pretty shitty move like butterfly labs breaking in hardware until the difficulty increased!

What I am sure about is that a monopoly source of ASICs is bad -- just as bad as a monopoly source of just about anything! I keep expecting to see mining pools get together and fund development of Korean (at least not Chinese) Asics that compete on hashes per watt. Otherwise, we're relying on a sole source in an authoritarian country that is determined to control the capital outflow that is enabled by bitcoin!

I'm not anti miners or anti China or anti BCC. I just wish I could buy a mining rig that's competitive with the antminers at within 3x or so the price per hashing power.   "
"Yeah, but I highly doubt that will happen.  

I'm not a fan of Core, but I have to say I'm pretty sure they are going to come out on top here.  

Their client is rock solid, and has a ton of developers.  

BU is pretty much ONE guy, and it's commissioned by people who are MONETARILY linked to Asic mining.  It's glaringly obvious what kind of power play this is to me.  

The fact that they have tried to wrap this up as some kind of moral crusade is disturbing to me.

I don't agree with your centralization arguments as the system will still be permissionless. Thats what you don't get. Bitcoin is amazing because it doesnt require permission to use. If you want to be a miner you do not need approval from a centralized organisation. If you want to open an account you don't need approval either. No one can deny you.

Those are two different statements. The first is false, bitcoin was *designed* with an implicit 32 MB max block size.

>Why would you want to specifically encourage people not to have unspent coins?

I want to encourage people not to create *unnecessary* unspent outputs, while increasing the amount of transactions allowed in blocks.

See [this article](https://segwit.org/why-a-discount-factor-of-4-why-not-2-or-8-bbcebe91721e) for an explanation of why a 75% discount was chosen. 

# tl;dr
>Empirical observation of network propagation has demonstrated that the peer-to-peer network can manage worst-case 4MB blocks provided that other costs, such as UTXO growth & quadratic scaling of hashing time, are mitigated."
"The main motivator against segwit is that it is a non solution for a non problem. Nothing every came of value out of the current team at core.

We needed larger blocks long ago, they didn't want to give them. It is that simple."
The less efficient miners start going out of business and the difficulty drops until the remaining miners can get by on fees. 
"That is what transaction fees are for.

But it won't be for more than 120 years from now, so it isn't an immediate concern."
Pardon? That's not how bitcoin works.
"You mean in 2140?

They mine fees, though I don't really make 120 year predictions."
"> Lightning network transactions are cheap and instant, and just as secure as bitcoin transactions.

Yes, and that's why we'll probably utilize them a lot in the future. Not only that, Lightning allows all kinds of cool stuff, like atomic swaps which can enable trustless crypto exchanges.

Anyway, not sure how that is relevant here. Segwit has nothing to do with Lightning and blocks should still be as big as possible. 1MB blocksize is nothing and makes a completely crippled coin that is unable to do anything on a global scale. Lightning doesn't magically change that. "

"No. The worst thing is no split. Look how much the fees are and ask yourself what that has done to adoption. In four months, when we need to increase the block size again we will once again be fighting this costly battle. We should ~~of~~ have forked two years ago

"> I am OK with Bitcoin (now called Bitcoin Cash) merely replacing wire transfer transactions the average person rarely bothers with. I agree that a distributed system is not ideal for things like cups of coffee.

I wanted to also address this. Bitcoin is better than wire transfers according to every metric *right now*. So why is an 8+ times scaling increase so immediate?"
"> segwit specifically gives a discount to off-chain transactions

No it does not. It discounts *signature data* in SegWit transactions. This is for two reasons

1. To allow it to occur via soft fork
2. To incentive the consumption and disincentivize the creation of UTXOs

I think we are now seeing first hand that soft forks are less disruptive than hard forks. Since the UTXO set should ideally be kept in memory, it's good to make people pay extra to create UTXOs, and pay less to spend them.

And yes, this does *as a side effect* incentivize multisig contracts, which some second layer systems do use.  "

"Not all Bitcoin Core developers work for BlockStream and not all BlockStream employees are Core developers. SegWit is widely adopted by wallets, exchanges, and miners. So ""BlockStream"" didn't change the incentive structure (for the positive).

Let's pretend they are equal though. All ""BlockStream"" did was purpose the invective change, the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem adopted it.

Does not increasing the block size change the incentive structure too? The goal is cheaper transactions, which sounds like a change in the incentive structure."
"The original comment was commenting on profitability. I was just pointing out that Zcash is currently more profitable. If Monero wants to attract miners like the OP, Monero needs to spread its wings gain support, and gain a higher price at the same difficulty.

"You're delusional. 

The market *leads*, hashpower *follows*."
Does that mean you plan to eventually trade your Bitcash altcoin for real Bitcoin?
Segwit would have removed the effectiveness of AsicBoost (which allows for 30% profit boost).  THIS is the reason the miners fought tooth and nail against segwit and have decided to hard fork off in an attempt to gain control of the development... It's pretty obvious no? 
"Hmm... 

I think it definitely fixes known bugs in the network.  

I don't think we needed larger blocks.  

I think the miners WANT us to think those things you said... "
My meaning was, what happens when the halvings reduce the block reward to a tiny amount?  Either the fees will become HUGE, or the coin hard cap will be removed by the miners and inflation will begin.  Is there another angle? 
Kick the can down the road and let the next person deal with it then?

Hilariously, I'm currently in another thread arguing with multiple people who somehow refuse to believe it's a soft fork, despite their own lead developer's words explicitly describing it as such. 
Market price doesn't matter. Bitcash is the original chain. Segwit coin is a popular fork. 
"No, its not clearly indicating that. The coin is not even realy usable yet and a large block hasn't even been found. Where do you suggest people will go to buy their bitcoin (BCC)?

When there are working exchanges, than you can make assessments on the market. Not before. Might be the bscoin takes the market, but that is early to tell.

Honestly I think ethereum will take the lead."
">What is your ideal bitcoin blocksize? And can that size handle a future lightning network? 

I actually support an increase in the base block size, when it can be done safely. To me that means giving some of the glaring inefficiencies, which SegWit does in a well tested way. Other things I'd like to see before a hard fork are better block propagation, SPV fraud proofs, maybe Schnorr signatures (but not if they take too long). I'd also like to see some of the hard fork wishlist items go into a block size hard fork, along with a lot of testing.

I'm also excited to see what sidechains will bring to the table.

"As I understand it the last common block has now been mined, so BCC are now baked in (provided it actually launches at all).

Somewhat surprisingly BTC (without BCC) is trading at the same price as BTC with BCC was trading at.  It should really be $300 cheaper.  Should have loaded up BTC before the fork then sold them and got BCC for free, sigh.



"
"Edit 3: Just disregard everything in this post. I am not up to date at all.

It is as soon as a reorg on BCC is unlikely. So probably about 6 blocks on the BCC chain. Furthermore make sure the tx has replay protection enabled.

Edit: As many people suggest otherwise, I checked the spec. It states that BCC nodes should follow blocks > 1 MB if a hardfork is detected after the activation time. This means any hardfork one block later than the first block after activation could be reorged by a single block directly after activation date, as the path to the longer chain has to follow a small block first. While this technically means BCC could fork from a different block than the first it can not be reorged to do so by a longer chain forking from a later block of the small block chain.

So my new statement is: Wait for one block on the BCC chain, make sure that it forks at the first block after the activation time and enable replay protection. This should be sufficient to make sure the BCC chain can not have the transaction.

Edit 2: Other people are right again. The format was changed one week ago to make replay protection mandatory. BCC will reject any transaction valid on the original chain. So feel free to trade BTC again after the first block, no need to care about replay protection."
AFAIK the BTC blockchain is now already separate from BCC, so you can send BTC which will not show anymore in the BCC chain.
nope
"The only way would be to look at certain pools that publicis the hash power on each chain such as, viaBTC then look for announcements from pools to see if they have announced support... then the big assumptions comes in... assume that the public stats is representative of the hash split in the pools that have announced support.

viaBTC is currently dedicating ~1% of the total network hash pre fork to BCC.

The other pools that announced support at bitcoin.com and BTC.top.

So we can assume ~2% of the prefork hash power is on BCC. meaning the first BCC block should be around ~ 8 hours away."

"
Exchanges, many of them at least,  already anounced that they would credit both coins for those holding a balance before the fork. They work with IOUs already, it's not like this changes much. It should only affect withdrawals, not trading.
check the spec more carefully -- the block after the MTP (median time of last 11 blocks) fork time MUST be > 1MB... so the BCC chain will wait here for a > 1MB block.  The only way we could change things now is if BTC reorged more than 18 blocks at this point (basically rewound all the way back to 6 or more blocks before the fork so it can change the MTP).

Good question! I'm wondering the same thing. Anyone got answers out there?

Some blocks will be under 1MB. And that's fine. All BCC needs to split cleanly is the first forked block to be over 1MB.
Roger and Jihan will just do what they've been doing all along... fabricating them.
They have already paid a lot of BCC sellers at 0.1 BTC per BCC. Imagine everyone starts to withdraw that 0.1 BTC. The price of BCC was artificially fixed at no less than 0.1 for several days. Several hundred BTC would have been needed per day for such marketmaking.

"This mainnet block (00000000000000000019f112ec0a9982926f1258cdcc558dd7c3b7e5dc7fa148)
was properly rejected by the BCC nodes.

I fail to see the irony.  ViaBTC got its BTC reward for this block.  If BTC and BCC truly fill different economic niches, then broadening the applicability of SHA256 hashing hardware can only benefit the miners that own them.  If they compete, then its better (for SHA256 miners) for one of them to eventually win than for an alt-coin with a different hash alg to do so (i.e. the flippening).

Tell us how much you hate freedom, free choice and the free market. 
There is something off about Todd.   Too smarmy git for me to be interested in what they say. 
I would probably at least wait until the first block is mined.
I'm holding both for a week.
yes

"what? if the price crashes, they can buy more cheap BCC to fill the fulfill the needs of anyone who wants to withdraw. Doesn't make sense. 

Besides, they don't sell anything directly, they're an exchange, they just put buyers and sellers together for a fee. "
already is (Kraken)
yes
"whatever the market will pay...

bip141 blocks do not matter. They just signal. There will be no segwit activated block for the next 2 weeks.
It's trading on Kraken.
"kraken and others are doing it 'off-chain' and will probably settle on-chain later

"
"You can but you must create two different data directories.  On Linux the data dir is /home/user/.bitcoin so an easy thing to do is create a new user and run your BCC client as that user.

You'll also need to change the default port..."
"Yah, that's what I'm doing out of paranoia even though I should know better, lol.
"
Not necessary to wait for the first block. What ever bitcoins you had in block 478558, you have as Bitcoin Cash bitcoins.
"First block came early at 2:12PM ET.

Thanks a lot. I do because I use my Ledger device. I may just wait until the dust settles and we see the first block of BCC. But I fear people may sell off BTC well before then and drop the price, damaging my exit strategy.
"what factual corrections? you just called him a lier and ignored the argument. Sure, call him out if he is a lier, but you have to also counter the lie on its technical grounds.

Otherwise it just looks like a straw man. "
"> similarly FT is exactly the same as segwit for their purpose of their handwaving yet they support and promote it too.

I think you are mistaking me for someone else? "
