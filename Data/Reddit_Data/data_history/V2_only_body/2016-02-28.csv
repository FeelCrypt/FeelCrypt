He didn't say it was. He was only listing it as one of the protocol changes Blockstream is pushing.
"> you're assuming ""off-chain"" means a custodian relationship like Coinbase. That's total nonsense.

You must be assuming the Lightning Network, right?  There is no Lightning Network yet, and there is no reason to believe that there will be one.  The more people look at the idea, the more problems they find; and the patches and workarounds only increase its complexity and fragility -- which are two of its big problems.  

Even if it were to be viable and be implemented, it would  have a centralized topology, with a couple of giant AML/KYC hubs --- which will get to know all the *off-chain* payments by everybody who uses them."
Don't believe him

Companies investing in blockstream will wind up with unfavorable returns, almost guaranteed. They want to be a unicorn, but they've already tripped over a half dozen roots trying to get into the enchanted forest. 
I think Greg mentioned it somewhen.
Holy fucking shit.

"Yes, and Google's motto is/was ""Don't be evil.""

That portion of the contract is meaningless when you conflate the interests of your clients and investors with the interests of the larger Bitcoin community.  In fact, that portion of the contract violates a core principle of responsible corporate governance without the conflation of interests that it ultimately reinforces."
Then get busy working on CT while others concern themselves with the scaling.
Thanks. I'm just a guy. But we all have a *hero mode* lurking inside us, and **it's time to speak out on this.**
