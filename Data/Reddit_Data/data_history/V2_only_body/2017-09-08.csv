How do you know that this news is false?
"That's stupid tin-foil hat talk. Yes governments can ban cryptocurrency. Will their bans be perfect? No, like every law, there will be some people in violation of it.


But can governments effectively cripple the ability to transfer large amounts of fiat into and out of crypto easily? Definitely. Can they effectively cripple the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrency by well established businesses and institutions, thereby limiting the ability of crypto to ever be used as a currency? Sure. Is a currency you can't readily obtain and can't ever expect to use for any ordinary purchase really appealing as a currency? Nope.



"
Yes, they can.
They are banning the exchanges... not the currencies...
"If they did ban it, that just drive it underground and it will still be as strong as ever.... so I'd say they can ban it but no, they cannot stop it that way

They would have to invest $2.5 billion into raw hash power to destroy people's confidence in it, that's all that can really stop bitcoin and the cost to do it keeps going up each day as more nodes come online"
Wrong.  It's a store of value no one can forcibly take away.  It will therefore always retain some value as long as the math isn't broken.
Don't tell Core.  Yadda yadda store of value yadda.

We're not even getting into what would happen if they banned bitcoin mining.  
"Even time the ""China bans Bitcoin"" news cycle comes back around I think, surely people have learned to ignore this by now...

Guess not."
"Like how governments forbid underage drinking and smoking? That's working wonders I bet.

Government trying to ban cryptocurrencies will only make it more powerful than it already is."
Holding Bitcoin is pointless if you can't use it.
">Is that so? Is that why Chinese people can still bypass certain websites that are banned from the country as well? 

Whether or not people can access it is irrelevant. Any government can make it illegal."

"No, they can't ban Bitcoin, it's decntralized.

Unless they ban the internet, of course.

That said, if they ban the EXCHANGES so that you cannot exchange your BTC into fiat, that would have probably a similar effect. "
Is that so? Is that why Chinese people can still bypass certain websites that are banned from the country as well?
"Banning exchanges effectively bans bitcoin. What does the government care if you hold bitcoins that you can't sell? 

Banning miners is another centralized failure point. This is why the centralization of mining is bad. Today's events should be just further reminder of why decentralization needs to be prioritized over all else."
They can ban whatever they want. Whether or not you choose to break the law and use it anyway is up to each individual.
It goes back to 2013
They can ban that in a heartbeat too. Great firewall of china decides what sites people can even use. They already made using a VPN illegal. Facebook and google already illegal.
"Only this is around the fifth time.

It's like that lady that stayed a virgin for her three kids"
"Because an equally dodgy source as the original said so.
I wish someone with actual knowledge would weigh in - perhaps from one of the exchanges.

"Regardless if it's real or not I can't understand why people are so fucking stupid to dump with news such as this.

No fucking government can ban cryptocurrency, NA DA."
"Even if the article is true, it specifically says that Bitcoin is not affected.

"
TLDR
Inductive reasoning. The last hundred times this happened were false.
Addictive substances don't derive value from being a widely accepted medium of exchange-currencies do. So long as a user is connected with their drugs it's fine. Good luck trying to use a brick of coke as currency.
are you guys jelly because no one cares enough to ban buttcash?
Well... it also requires people willing to pay you for it to give it value. It's not *just* math.

The point that rings loudest is r/BTC doesn't censor.  I actually liked Segwit and lightning but the censor issue makes you rethink it all. 
US$0.005 (half a penny).  If you're feeling really crazy you can pay $0.25, but that's just being generous to the miners. 
Problem is, when the next wave of adoption happens, will people be paying through the nose again like before? its all good to say the transactions are cheap now in a sluggish period...
"The word 'retard' also means 'to slow down'.  Core has been very successful at slowing down Bitcoin's growth.

Bitcoin Cash took the training wheels off.  Real growth can continue."
I know they spread lies and use misinformation all the time, but attacks like this make me feel uneasy. If this is truely r/bitcoin doing, there will be a bloody drama ahead and my bet is on Bitcoin (Cash)
That's why I call it a bet
"Now watch as the ""downvotes = censorship"" idiots also try and claim that ""tipping = shill payments"""

I doubt Core will intervene with any kind of changes in some last-ditch effort to bring BTC past the stone age. You've got two kinds of Core people: Fiat nuts and speculators. The Fiat nuts will just jump onto BCC the way they jumped onto BTC, and the community's fight against banking cartels will start all over again. The speculators will be gone by that point, having cashed out and left all the bag holders in the dirt.

Your last sentence is really where I have pretty much fallen on it all at this point. I'm not trying to troll, but from my perspective crypto currency looks a lot more like beanie babies than a currency. Which disappoints me because there are a lot of things right with the idea of crypto currency.

"I do not disagree with the argument that the market will eventually determine the future of all coins, but I wonder if the evolving framework of cryptocurrency in general will not change to accept both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash for different purposes. It seems to me that Bitcoin is evolving into a store of value or a settlement layer and away from a medium of exchange, whereas Bitcoin Cash along with Litecoin and possibly other less recognizable currency coins are designed primarily to be mediums of exchange. 


Bitcoin has become so valuable (expensive) and speculative (based a great deal on its deflationary nature) that most people are unwilling to actually use it out of fear that they will lose future gains. Additionally, these same characteristics make it less acceptable to merchants because the valuation fluctuates so much that setting prices is problematic. In a way, Bitcoin Cash will eventually suffer from these issues regardless of transaction speed and cost because it will also be deflationary. That has yet to become an issue, but it certainly could. 


In the end, both might prove to be a store of value upon which other currencies, systems, and mediums of exchange are based in much the same way as gold was used. In this case, I predict the coins with massive amounts in existence (don't laugh, but things like Doge or Linda) might become the real mediums of exchange because their large numbers in circulation will hamper speculation and therefore fluctuation making them acceptable to both consumers and merchants. In the end, if the market is really to compete with fiat, will not be those of us who are sharing on this sub, but the mothers and fathers and grandparents who are shopping for groceries who will not be interested in anything other than how to predict the price of bread from day to day.  


I am still encouraged by these events, however, because even if some of these coins become settlement layers or stores of value, they will still be more transparent and fair than fiat. Cryptocurrency, in any form, is still more real than the fake paper printed by reserve banks."

I found a link to this post on the front page. I read the article and had a question. Even though that is my opinion currently I am always interested to learn more and open to having my opinion changed.
"The fees are lower now because there are less transactions on the Bitcoin chain and also because it is slightly more profitable for the miners to mine BTC at the moment. Fees will grow again the next time BCH becomes more profitable to mine.

I doubt very much the high fees are behind us. They just come in waves."
I'll probably just gamble on both then. I mean why not, since I'm treating it like gambling and not investing.
"Fees only rise because blocks are full. We're a long ways from being there _again_, and even then, we'll just up the block size _again_

Edit: clarified not being a small blocker"
Yeah I totally agree, don't fall in the confirmation bias trap!

"That's the great part about the 8mb blocks. Cash mined its first full block during a massive spam transaction attack a few weeks ago. It took hardly any time at all to clear the transaction backlog and return to normal. That same attack on the Bitcoin network would have crippled it (though it would have cost way more to carry out thanks to high fees).

Transactions will remain cheap and fast even if market cap and usage levels for BCC were to match those for BTC tomorrow. Likely well beyond that point, too. Nobody at this point can argue the block size increase did not work as intended.

The only argument left is whether a hard fork block size increase is a viable long-term solution for scaling. If we're pushing for worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash (i.e. White Paper), 8mb is not enough and we'll have to fork again. And again. Is that healthy? I'm still personally not convinced either way, but there are good arguments for either side.

My biggest issue with second-layer solutions is the on ramp. Even if the second layer is great, we still have to use the blockchain to get people onto the second layer. I've yet to read about any solution to this problem that does not involve a block size increase."

Bitcoin cash is only terrifying if you don't realize it's full potential. BCC is much more functional and useful in terms of payments, fees, etc. People still don't even have all of their Bitcoin cash accessible. Wait until that happens and you'll see it's potential start to unravel 
I only just started learning about crypto currency. If bitcoin cash is superior, what happens to people who own bitcoin core currency?

"So as someone who got interested in cryptocurrency recently (and so far I mostly just have ETH), I didn't actually know that the *forked* version of Bitcoin was staying more true to the original vision of the coin. But based on that information and my (admittedly limited) knowledge of the crypto market, would it be reasonable to expect a ""reversal of fortunes,"" so to speak, between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash? That is, could we expect Bitcoin Cash to see incredible gains and even catch up with/take over Bitcoin Core's position in the market? Bitcoin Core has gotten close to 5000 USD/coin recently. It was under 3k USD hardly a month ago, before the fork. It would seem that, perhaps, having all of the ""elite"" investors and financial institutions backing it is good for the health of the coin and probably makes it much less likely to rapidly or significantly lose value. But if Bitcoin *Cash* is the currency that will most likely be used ""on the streets"" and in the average person's day-to-day life, could that be enough on its own for it to truly compete with Bitcoin Core?"

"How certain are you about the troll interpretation? Website hijack attempts and posting of manipulated fake repos sound scary to me as a BCH and electron cash user.

Even if it was trolls and not malicious attackers, your reaction seems immature. Critizising the way you handle yourself as a developer/maintainer (no https originally, unsigned binaries, website under fake name, having to ask whether you should take action against people creating fake githubs) or critizising the software you wrote does not in any way attack bitcoin cash as a whole. 

Your actions do however make it hard to trust your software, to be honest. Which is what I took from the posts you percieved to be troll attacks.

I recommend getting a code signing certificate from https://codesigncert.com/ if you are serious about security based development. Yes it costs money (around $60 a year), but you could ask for donations for that or see it as an investment into your portfolio as a security software developer.

Another recommendation is to never take such attacks lightly. Treat them as malicious attacks even if you suspect it could be a harmless troll.

Honestly, I am in support of whoever has the fastest, most secure and cheapest network.

"When I first started in Bitcoin I was primarily attracted by the technology, fast transactions, and low fees.

Bitcoin has become less of a transaction mechanism for the masses and more of a play-toy for the elite few that would rather pay more than less and have slow instead of fast (basically cutting off their noses to spite their faces).

I have switched to Bitcoin Cash and will never wonder about my decision or look back over my shoulder at my decision to switch.

Btw, this subreddit is also ""censored"" though I prefer term ""moderated"". I've been banned twice (open moglod? I bet you will NOT find anything about these bans from that thing. That's how much ""open modlog"" matters.) Additionally I'm currently restricted to 5 posts a hour. The mods here say it's not suppression and will not remove the restriction (although they've removed it for some others). Now talking about this ""censorship"": What do you think, is 5 posts a hour suppression or not? How about one per day or one per month?

*Note: This is one of the posts I am allowed to post. I and many others are actively silenced by the mods. You can't see the posts we can't make. This subreddit is heavily restricted and nowhere near uncensored or free.*
"
There's a link for the moderation logs on the sidebar...
"This isn't true at all. Numerous people have complained they are getting artificially limited from posting more than a few times over several minutes. 

Here's two comments that were censored even in response to your comment:

* [First one](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ysf0s/bitcoin_cash_is_terrifying/dmq1u27)
* [Second one](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ysf0s/bitcoin_cash_is_terrifying/dmq4aa6)"

The reason I haven't invested in bcc is this, I'm worried that when they do finally get their BCC (I'm mainly referring to those on coinbase) you're going to see the price dive due to a massive sell off, I don't think the average person on coinbase who gets  BCC is going to hold.
Nice
You have a space after the second forward slash.

"> Doesn't bigger blocks also make full nodes only affordable only by big players?

No.  The timeline where we fill up 8Mb blocks is a few years, unless adoption, and then value, skyrocket.  The cost of storing the entire blockchain now is dollars, maybe 10's of dollars.

By the time we get to VISA level of transactions, in 20-30 years, the cost to store the entire Blockchain, will be dollars.  By that time, the value of Bitcoin will be so high, that the cost of running a full node, on whatever counts for commodity hardware at that time, will be like a grain of sand in a sandbox.

Using Bitcoin as a settlement layer, is saying we will exclude most everyone so we do not risk excluding everyone.  It is not what Bitcoin is or what is supposed to do.  People can make things on top of it, but no one should be trying to Cripple Bitcoin to make their thing look better.  Make Lightning, make it another Crypto, but do not FUD about inconsequentials in order to make your Altcoin seem valuable."
Goes for both sides...

Please show us some of your articles for comparison.
"Thank you for proving one of the points in the article that the attacks on Bitcoin Cash are of a dishonest nature.  ""$20k"" nodes as mentioned by CSW are for a machine that does 500k sigops/sec.  Do you know how big the Bitcoin network will be at that time?  Also at that time , the cost of that machine will be far less than 20k.  Bitmain is a company that makes mining gear.  How exactly is it going to be a peer->Bitmain network? wut??  Top down governnance? huh??  Obviously its not supposed to make any sense but rather confuse the new reader.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit.  Good work."

Most are in favour of its development as an option. Not as THE scaling solution. I am fine with LNs and centralised hubs as an option, but I don't think it should be pushed as the path of light.
2nd layer options are welcome but that need to compete with the 1st layer fairly.
Because without a robust first layer, you're building a house that will suck if not fall.

because r/bitcoin is the main decision maker of all bitcoin.
"> The point that rings loudest is r/BTC doesn't censor.

BTC nor BCH/BCC/BCA/BCSH/BCASH are fungible. Look for Monero to outpace both of them."
"The thing you have to remember here, is that BCC and BTC could end up turning out far more like Betamax and VHS than Blu Ray and HD DVD. Betamax was the clearly superior technology (like BCC), but VHS won due to huge advantages in distribution rights and content deals (like BTC). 

Now, that example is purely allegorical. The crypto currency wars are still very much being fought. Any currency currently extant, or in development might win. Looking at crypto currencies as anything other than a risk/speculative asset is potentially dangerous for your financial security.
"
The latter example is more accurate.
Right now you can exchange bitcoin for bitcoin cash and vice versa. They are two separate currencies. Their price will depend on their popularity/use
"This article, thus sub, /r/bitcoin, and this reply are all fundamentally biassed by their own opinions. If you asked this question in the /r/bitcoin sub, you could get an answer identical to /u/Teru-Sama's reply. The opinion about which coin would be HD-DVD and which would be blu-ray would depend on who you asked though...

In the end, the market will go to whatever cryptocoin has the best combination of robustness, decentralization, adoption, and security. One side of the fence is saying: ""we don't want big blocks (yet) because it will hurt decentralization"", the other says: ""we want to remain true to Satoshi's original vision"".

In the end, it will be the market that decides what coin is chosen as bitcoin, and the other will pass into obscurity (barring other innovations obv.). Look at the big picture. Weigh in hard facts and discount the value of opinions or unproven theories. Stay on relevant topics, and don't be turned away from them by FUD spread by either side. Look at usage statistics and trends. Crypto is still in its infancy, and buying crypto is much like investing. Don't invest in things you don't completely understand or see any future in.

Well, how will we kill the infidels? Pure evil must die. 
This has been going on for years, to many people. It's proven.
That is a bizarre good point.
"Sure it does exist, the fact that I was banned. But log about this? I don't know. Link it to me from the so open modlog?

E.g. one of the r/btc mods talks about the ban here: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r0eid/time_to_get_serious_here_dont_let_your/d4xlspc/"
If we would really want to sabotage the project of the enemy (Blockstream and the Bitcoin Core project that they took control over) we should infiltrate them and plant a 6 transactions per second limit into their software. Oh wait, they already did that to themselves. It's like competing with a somewhat retarded competitor. Not really a fair competition but sure, we'll accept their challenge. May the least retarded currency win.

It's important to realize that BCC can be better and truer to the original vision and still lose.  BTC Core has been the biggest player on the scene for a while and that can't be discounted.  There's no clear victor here so place your chips if you're gonna.
No, the market is already speaking, listen to what it says.

Actually, this post is not any form of drug. In fact, it's an article filled with words and sentences. 
I have more trust in kraken because of their past practices. But they are pretty unusable during congestion hours right now, so very bad for short term trading. Bittrex is much better for such an use but I do not trust them as much yet.
No. You can backup your secret phrase, like with any other wallet that gives you control of your own keys. There are no accounts, registrations, or passwords.
This is so cool. I wonder if illegal numbers are in the blockchain too.
Thanks.
Thanks! New to this, and still learning about what makes a good exchange.
You'd probably stop eating unhealthy burgers. Great!
I've just opened an account on Kraken. After using bittrex and Krakeb, which would you recommend? 
Using the Bitcoin.com Wallet. The owner printed out a QR code generated by the app to make it easier for people to pay at the register. Whoever was at the register also had the address open on a blockchain explorer and could see when the payment had been sent.
Ok so if keys are lost ni access to wallet. But account can be accessed w passwords right?
Looks like they did 22 transaction for about $85 total - [Address HERE](https://www.blocktrail.com/BCC/address/1MmuHZd7Cs3z1oWx1jp6ppXkxcPGGaCj3b) and [QR Code Here](http://imgur.com/a/OSV62)
Honestly I've spent literally 100 BTC over the years. I see people who held whilst I spent my time and money. giving it away to promote adoption in some cases ( that all stopped when my demos stopped getting included in the next block though)...
"Exactly.  If nobody actually uses it, it's no more than a worthless ponzi scheme.

That's why it's dumb to talk about the 10,000 btc pizza or whatever it was.  If it wasn't for those early transactions bitcoin could have died a long time ago."
"You made me cry with laughter :'D
Nice multi-level joke."
That's super cool. Given that the Chinese are already accustomed to paying by QR (Alipay, WeChat) this sounds like it's not too much of a leap. Would be super excited to see more merchants do this in the future!
That's great man. As far as I'm concerned, that excitement back in the day is what built Bitcoin. We were proving you could actually USE it.
The Bitcoin.com wallet does not require an account with any company. Only normal Bitcoin keys are used. The wallet is compatible with all other standard Bitcoin Cash wallets.
Thanks! :) 
where is this again? i think you answered but its not showing up for me
opa gangnam style.
Yup were also promoting crypto CURRENCY.
How dare you spam the blockchain and not buy me one :D

Did they know the difference between BTC and BCH? Did you have to explain and/or convince them?
