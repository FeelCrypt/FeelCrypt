"> IF it was agreed upon the right way and had consensus.

So what is agreeing ""in the right way"" for you? Segwit was the consenus that got 90% miner approval. A loud minority was against ever increasing 1MB because reasons and started that FUD after segwit got enabled. Everybody else got tired of arguing and isn't reading r/bitcoin anymore."
There will be a network because mining it is profitable and using it as store of value is still useful even though store of value + electronic cash is more useful.
Litecoin and Dash are both bigger competitors than Monero.
Because we're talking about people making collective decisions. You're right. It would be wrong to refer to users of a thing, but it's right to refer to a large group of people affecting change.
"I can but I was called these specific things in a Bulgarian crypto facebook group. Well ""mindless sect"" was actually said by a big blocker (not me) to insult Core supporters. Also people were using their real names. I won't hold it against them but the divide is so hard that they won't come back out of spite. Although to be honest one of them apologized for using personal insults in the debate."
"There will be some kind of network, I agree.

It won't be a very *useful* network though, which is my point.

All utility will switch to Bitcoin Cash.  And then so will the adoption. And then so will the price."
"They said this ""we are going to make a non backwards compatible upgrade to the consensus rules, it's going to happen in just a few days, we don't care what the community thinks so we won't ask, and we won't even bother to inform other client devs about this change beforehand. And on top of that we will change to an algorithm that is new and only a few have seen, but they say it is super"" - that is essentially what ABC devs have communicated so far (that I have seen).

I have asked before what kind of consensus they have from miners (since they say they do) but no reply to that.
So we simply don't know anything about what miners will accept since there even is no ""voting"" going on (correct me if I'm wrong on this point!)

So AFAIK ABC is currently using dictatorship to do this ""upgrade"".
I agree that the upgrade needs to happen, but to short notice, algo out of the blue without prior discussion. And a press release without any information via the normal channels... Also note that this was done via the ABC client. Not the Bitcoin Cash Spec repo which we should expect to have this information first.

To reiterate: announcements of breaking changes should if at all possible be done via the Spec repo first. So that discussions can be made. If a client then decides, ""we will implement it like this and you can run it if you want"" that's fine. But saying ""everyone must implement it like this since we say so"" - that's just absurd."

"I'm not asking them to apologise, but as the side that was literally forcibly exiled it's going to be very gratifying when the market proves the theory right.

Maybe it won't be now (although this is the strongest surge yet), maybe this is just the latest crack in the armor, but I am 100% sure Bitcoin Cash will be worth more than legacy Bitcoin eventually."

Yes BTC and ETH can be traded for bitcoin cash (BCC) on Bittrex 
I don't understand why BCC was ever an option.  At that time BitConnect was in the top 15 of coins.  Just because you think a coin is a scam doesn't mean you can just take it's ticker.  It has caused much confusion and probably helped BitConnect break into top 10.

"> My confusion is why wouldnt you want both chains to exist?

What makes you think I don't?

Segwit was shoehorned in using a coersive soft fork, along with lies and deception with ""agreements"" to increase the blocksize afterwards.

If it had been announced as an altcoin fork, and actual Bitcoin left alone, I would have been fine with it.

The problem is not with Segwit coin - the problem is that they used Segwit to kill off Bitcoin, then tried to lay claim to the name.  It's quite a few things, **but it's not Bitcoin**.

> Bitcoin is far from perfect and the technology needs to be scaled appropriately.

Bitcoin is dead.  Segwit Coin certainly has issues with scaling that should be addressed.

> Since you are a BTC/BCH holder, what is your purpose for completely dismissing the fact that it is in all of our best interests for both to succeed in the future?

I want both to succeed.  What I don't want is people misleading people (particularly new people to CryptoCurrencies) into thinking that SegWit Coin is the classic Bitcoin.  It's not, and it's deceptive to try to market things that way.

If you want a spiritual successor to Bitcoin, there's Bitcoin Cash, which is actually usable, and provides the same experience as Bitcoin once did.

Digital peer-to-peer cash is exciting and groundbreaking.  Four hour wait times and an inability to buy anything without a $20 fee is not.  If we're going to introduce people to cryptos, Bitcoin Cash makes a lot more sense.

> The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Segwit Coin is Bitcoin.

If any coin has claim to the name Bitcoin, it should be Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and a distributed ledger of signature chains.  Segwit coin is neither of those two things.

> Also, since you are an engineer, why do you take the current state of Bitcoin as the 'end state', forgetting that its a work in progress (as is BCH).

I don't.  If you buy a car, rip off the wheels, attach cables to the wheels, and use it to lift an elevator car up and down, it's not a car anymore.  It's not useless, but that's not an ""innovation"" in cars either.

**When you change something so it no longer does the very thing it was designed and defined to do, it's no longer the thing it originally was.**

Words have meaning, and attempting to redefine Bitcoin into something fundamentally incompatible with the original design principles results in losing what it was that made it Bitcoin.

Bitcoin with 8MB blocks is still bitcoin - it originally didn't have a blocksize limit.  Bitcoin without a distributed chain of signatures is not Bitcoin anymore.

> If you are a holder of BTC, why bash it on this sub?

The same reason you get after Bitcoin Cash - people pretending it's something its not.  I also don't like the deceptive way in which it's been taken over and much of its usability destroyed.

I *liked* Bitcoin.  I'm not particularly happy it's dead.

> I guess I am having a hard time understanding your incentive to label BCH as Bitcoin when you yourself hold a 20:1 ration of BTC/BCH.

I'm an Engineer.  I care about design and accuracy.  Segwit coin is useful, but no amount of holdings or usefulness are going to change that it *intrinsically* violates the very definition of Bitcoin, making it **not Bitcoin**.

> Someone in your shoes should want both chains to scale properly and provide requisite benefits.

Again, who says I don't?

I supported Segwit 2X for the same reason that I support Bitcoin Cash.  If Bitcoin were still around, I'd support it too, but if that were the case, SegwitCoin would be dead.  Without the UASF brinkmanship, Segwit never would have activated, or would have had a chain death spiral."
"Ok so we are very similar in a lot of respects. 

My confusion is why wouldnt you want both chains to exist?  Bitcoin is far from perfect and the technology needs to be scaled appropriately.

The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.  By simple language definition, it is not and continuing that facade will just confuse people.  You have to at least agree w/ that??

Also, since you are an engineer, why do you take the current state of Bitcoin as the 'end state', forgetting that its a work in progress (as is BCH).  Bitcoin has to evolve to survive, just like any piece of software.  If you are a holder of BTC, why bash it on this sub?

I guess I am having a hard time understanding your incentive to label BCH as Bitcoin when you yourself hold a 20:1 ration of BTC/BCH.  Someone in your shoes should want both chains to scale properly and provide requisite benefits."
"As an engineer, surely you must have seen instances where consumer markets have ignored all technical superiority and gone with a popular option.

BCH holders believe that the segwit is a bad technical solution and increasing blocksize is the simple elegant solution that is in line with the original intent of Bitcoin. Obviously there are people who believe the complete opposite, where segwit/LN is an elegant solution and increasing blocksize is crude and bad technical decision."

You're saying Bitcoin has a central point of failure, and it's some companies that track the blockchain(which anyone can track as it's literally a public ledger) who somehow withhold data/transcations while tracking the public ledger.
How do they withhold this data/transactions? Are you saying they censor transactions from appearing on the network?

 I honestly don't understand what you mean. Can you rephrase your point?"
"> Do you think there is a place for what is now called Bitcoin, to exist as a primary store of value and for BCH to exist as the payment system, backed by the BTC store of value? Isnt that goal that would make everyone happy? What am I missing here.

Sure.  That place is called anything other than Bitcoin.

Segwit Coin is not the proper heir to the Bitcoin name or legacy, and I'm personally going to try to remind people of that where I can - likely for many of the same reasons you feel compelled to speak about how ""Bitcoin Cash"" isn't technically Bitcoin.

Yes.  I told them that.  They really are a service that probably started selling game codes and other virtual items where Paypal does not serve the market.  They latched onto Bitcoin Cash early and I hope they are rewarded for that, but they should drop the fee.  For me, 5% is a burden but not an impossibility.  I could not pay 5% if I was selling electronics for example.  But I am selling $2 stickers.
5% is nothing in comparison to overhead of old system of money actually. With open blockchains u cut multiple costs in different tables, not only VISA's fees
"I can't imagine that you're actually naive enough to think the account numbers will stay unknown forever. 

It already happens often that people figure out who or what a public key is associated with. Over time, especially with concerted efforts, and with large specific purchases, it will be very easy to tell what accounts are owned by large corporations.

It's perfectly reasonable to want to protect your investment. And I'm sure before it's all said and done the price of BTC and BCH will both rise dramatically. But in the end neither will be king, and that is a very simple fact if you look at it objectively."

Have you tried to move as decent amount of gold around the world? It's slow and expensive. Not sure why you think it's cheap to move gold. Society created fiat currency mainly to deal with how expensive it was to move gold.

Bitcoin is, by definition, a distributed chain of signatures in a ledger.

Segwit Coin is, by definition, **not** a distributed chain of signatures in a ledger.

"> To the outside, you just seem like someone who wants others to get involved in your lowcost alternative so that you can profit more simply because you do not own BTC. Its a cheap shot and that is why this community comes off as toxic.

My holdings are about 20:1 Segwit Coin to Bitcoin Cash.  I've refrained from holding Bitcoin Cash due to the EDA.  I don't like to invest when there's that much volatility.

> Also, I take it that you are not an engineer and most likely just a young kid trying to get rich quick?

My background is in software engineering, though I'm in management at the present.  I make a lot more building things that use cryptocurrencies than speculating in them.

For the solutions I build that use cryptocurrencies, it's the usability as a medium of exchange that provides value, not it's value as a speculative asset store.

As for Bitcoin Cash being a ""lowcost alternative"", it's the effective rate of return that matters, not the nominal cash price.  The specific dollar amount is in many ways arbitrary - Satoshi could have set the supply at double, or half, and it would change the nominal cash price but have little change on its intrinsic worth, beyond some psychological value.

I'm one of those crazy people that actually bought things, regularly, with Bitcoin - ""**A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**"".  

My biggest issue with Segwit coin is that it's deliberately had its transaction volume artificially constrained to the point that it's utility as a medium of actual exchange for most normal transactions has been effectively eliminated.  It's changed things from peer-to-peer electronic cash to node-to-node electronic brokerages.  

There's still plenty of utility in that as a settlement layer, but that's not Bitcoin, and it's inconsistent with the original implementation or principles."

"Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer digital cash.

Bitcoin Core is a ponzi scheme."
"Core, the main developers of Bitcoin, have been stalling upgrading the system for years, apparently to try to benefit a company (Blockstream) that pays several of the Core developers, by pushing people away from using Bitcoin by crippling the chain with congestion and high fees (they used the excuse that they were afraid running the system would get too expensive if it was upgraded; but there is no point in making it cheap to run the system if it's too expensive to actually use it); and they have been pushing for an unnecessary modification, called SegWit, that helps that company implement their service (and there is some suspicion that there might be issues with the code, vulnerabilities, hard to fix bugs etc).

As that modification was about to go live, a large number of people decided to avoid it, and instead apply the upgrades that the system has been needing for years; that's what we know today as Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash got much more capacity, doesn't have that bad modification, and also undid another modification, RBF, that had significantly reduced the reliability of zeroconf transactions. Up to the point of the split, August 1st, Bitcoin Cash has the same transaction history as Bitcoin Core, so if you had bitcoins during the fork in August 1st, you have the same number of coins in the Bitcoin Cash chain."
"New to bitcoin but for all i could understand bitcoin cash has more capacity for transactions per day (2millions) than btc classic (250k), that means more transactions per second which translates to faster payments and lower fees, while these fees in BTC classic are going up a lot more, in a ever growing market which more people are adopting bitcoin its better to adopt a new updated platform than to stick to a older one that will colapse eventually with eternal transactions times and expensives fees.

Also Cash is less centralized than Bitcoin classic."
"Remember, you posted this question in the Bitcoin Cash fanboy subreddit. The responses will be extremely skewed so proceed with caution.

His main criticism against on-chain scaling seems to be the exponential growth of blocks (reaching gigabytes or oven more) over time.  But.. he does not mention the amount of time needed for these problems to start being relevant.

- no reason for complaints by Core

- mine it as long as it is profitable and shift to BCH

I suspect the miners are so pissed that most of them are now going for BCH and the more they own BCH, the less they'll allow Bitcoin to go anywhere except Bitcoin gold. Incentives.

Which was their self-selected goal. Be careful what you wish for.

And, yes, I think this will eventually lead to the flippening. I would have preferred a head-on collision course, but I guess this might be cultural.

You can stop spewing Maxwellian nonsense now. Cash **will** do scaling by SPV - and it will actually be *fine*. Without a fire surround you, like in that famous cartoon.
"
Also look at number of coins , market cap, coins in circulation.   Once you do the math you realize no way should litecoin ever be worth over $50.   Heck vertcoin I don't own and it's at $4 bucks I think and that has similar coins to litecoin and so if anything put your money into vertcoin before litecoin any day.  At least they don't have a Charlie.  I'm reluctant to buy vtc though.   Feels and looks like I should have sold some Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin cash..
"Nope, Segwit ""expands"" capacity by kicking signature data out of the block; net effect if _everyone_ starts using Segwit transactions is a 0.7MB effective increase on average. There are ""second layer"" solutions like Lightning and Sidechains that are ""enabled"" by Segwit and purportedly solve the capacity problem forever; they are, however, fraught with various dangers of centralization, regulation, usability problems etc. that are _way_ more serious than bigger blocks. Give Lightning and Sidechains a search in this sub, you'll see them. "
"We will, but there are some tweaks to go into the software before we go beyond that. nChain recently test-bounced cross-continent GB blocks with positive results; we'll likely do way more rigorous testing and optimizing before 32MB hits us. Things like the Graphene relay protocol, full-parallel validation etc. will likely need to be incorporated before that. 

But unlike Core which refuse to even consider or test, we do have that on the roadmap. "

"Thanks for the tip!

> That's actually a very good point. I bet from his perspective he wants to justify continuing to mine the legacy chain for now without getting crucified by the BCH crowd.

Yeah see I saw it all the time as a fight *within* Bitcoin to get to a sane compromise.

The miners rather see the 'exit' as the right approach. I suspect this might be a) a cultural issue and b) one of efficiency. See also Jihan's tweet, praised by the small blockers, about building stuff and not fighting.

The market itself might do the fighting part soon enough.

I hope that a side result from this is that Cash will develop better decision making processes. I think they'll be a lot more miner heavy and ultimately depend on the 51% - as it should. 


But the fight is over, and Core folks clearly have won and we lost. They can enjoy their coin now - they might not *at all* enjoy the incentives of the miners going forward, though. Bitcoin gold is gold now: They have clearly demonstrated their willingness to never increase on-chain capacity.

And if it flips, anyone who wasn't *actively* getting rid of Cash kept their coins. So there's that, keeping the balance sheet intact."
">But the fight is over, and Core folks clearly have won and we lost.

Agree with your other points except for this one. How have we lost? We have the preserved Bitcoin. We have cheap and fast transactions. They haven't won at anything but censoring and pretending everything is hunky dory. 

History has shown that you give Core an inch and they'll use it to stab you in the back. That is the only reason I want a swift death for the legacy chain. The sooner Core is fired from the Bitcoin protocol the sooner we can move on to making global p2p cash."
"> Agree with your other points except for this one. How have we lost? We have the preserved Bitcoin. We have cheap and fast transactions. They haven't won at anything but censoring and pretending everything is hunky dory. 

Yes, maybe it is a matter of perspective: Old awemany thinks he lost the 2x fight and that's the perspective I wrote it from, new awemany thinks this BCH might actually have preserved the original vision. 

The time to cheer will be when market cap, cumulative difficulty and transaction rate (the easy one) are at number 1.

Not easy, especially with being in spot #3 now, but IMO very possible.

Cash shows that they can. Whether that is true long term, will depend a lot the price of the respective coins.

"Good answer. Technically yes, and also technically, we cannot prove a negative.  I am not convinced.  If such person were aligned against economic freedom that would be a data point.  But he isn't that I can see. Until I know the complete story my mind is going to stay open about this.  I am more convinced such person is targeted for destruction by fiat declarers and their agents the world over, which tends to earn a person my defense.

Nobody will erase history of Blockstream, we'll make sure of it
Core is not up to decide. The market is. 
Ad hominem has nothing to do with increasing chance of wiping out Bitcoin Segwit chain., People are talking math and economics
"Copypasta from myself: 

>This is the reason I'll always hate him _way_ more than Core; he's in the small-blockers camp before it existed (2012). Back then Litecoin's whole value is based on the hypothesis that Bitcoin can never raise its blocksize; bitcoiners laughed and rightfully looked at him as a retard. Several years of dev compromises and social engineering later, he's now ""proven right"" by having bitcoin crippled _as he wanted_. 

Also, Litecoin contributed zero technology and zero new economic frontier to crypto: Their community is a joke just waiting for pies to fall from Bitcoin congestion. I'll take the Satoshi ledger over giving a single penny to this crowd any day. "
Plenty of reasons.  Too many to even list.
"Note that I also have an issue with its community, and as an idealist oldie bitcoiner who wants to change the world, would not want to enrich these opportunist fucks in any way. (You can call the Litecoin ledger the ""Lee ledger"" instead of the ""Satoshi ledger""). Also BCH does in fact make some very important improvements over Litecoin:

- BCH doesn't have Segwit, an ugly hack of 0.7MB ""increase"" that incurs unnecessary technical debt on the chain. Litecoin voluntarily became a testnet for Segwit implementation, on the other hand; and to this day it did jack squat for them. 

- BCH fixed the quadratic hash problem, a perennial argument against big blocks. Litecoin opted to instead decrease blocktime, which is _way_ worse for any potential ""centralization"" than bigger blocks, as that makes very-short-interval blocks that are latency-sensitive (instead of bandwidth-sensitive, a very solvable problem) much worse. 

- BCH can flip to 32MB via 51% of miners flipping to switch. Litecoin follows the ole Core formula of never hard-forking, and will face the same problems as Core if they ever get any actual use."
"The problem is if they do a hardfork now, merchants and services would look at the options on the table: hardfork to CripplecoinV2, or adopt BCH? 

They previously mostly stayed with Cripple because they didn't want to hardfork at all, and the switch was ""contentious"": Well, now they don't get a choice, both are hardforks and both are ""contentious"". I think the choice forward then becomes pretty obvious."
"> Doesn't look like the miners hate either coin

Miners **can't afford politics**. That's exactly why only one chain survives on a scale"

Cheers!
Not with that attitude. Fuck haters
1 hieroglyph )
Not exactly. Read about Nash theorem and risk assessment
I refuse. I wish Litecoin, its founder and all who bought into it ill. Fuck them. Others are okay, but not Litecoin.
Nice guys.  Happy to have good heart people on our side. 
Great attitude.
Wise words, love, don't hate

Yes!!! /u/tippr $5.00
I see you are coin agnostic !
"Too bad 99% of other people in your community are still like

""HURRR DURR THEYMOS SENSORD ME, BIG BLOCKS, 100 PETAHASH BLOCKS"""
Sounds like he saying don’t be a player hater lmao
I think he makes a smart move. Now that BCH is here, he will start to mine it and SegwitCoin will slowly die from it's inability to scale. The only thing we have to do is being welcoming to others !
I'm new, can someone ELI5 who Jihan Wu is?
I feel like this quote is from art of war book, haven't read it yet... Is it? 
There is a difference between not attacking, and not defending yourself from attacks.
"Competition always brings out the worst in people. That's just how it is.

If you want friendship and peace, replace competition with organized cooperation. 

"
A quick search yields [this](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/07/06/never-interfere/).
"Learn from, ok.  Make BCH better, definitely.  

Befriend, not everyone.  The enemies of Bitcoin are not finished, we are going to have to deal with a lot more of their filth before this is over.  I'm sorry Jihan, while I think you are a super nice guy, I just don't believe we'll be returning to the friendly community of Bitcoin's early days.  Not any time soon.  There is too much is at stake."
I love you 
You can start by adopting SegWit. But too much of Ver's ago, and of his failed trollarmy for it now :D
"Jihan is being a pussy. No other way around it. I completely disagree with him on this. He keeps trying to distinguish Bitcoin Cash from BTC as if legacy Bitcoin will have a spot in the future. He's either playing some mind games or he's just being ignorant. You can't ""play nice"" with Core. They must be destroyed by the abandonment of hashrate.

Edit: to clarify - I respect Jihan. But if you've been following his statements in the past few days then he keeps trying to say that Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin. I disagree with him on this point very strongly."
Now he thinks he's Confucius
Cools, I'm in.  I'll do my best to befriend them, learn from them and not hate them.  It might be a one way street for now, but hopefully that will change.
"Why do you misquote Jihan Wu?! This is the full quote:

""BCH community needs to learn a hard lesson. Be friend with other competing coins, learn from them, and make BCH better. Don't play hatred, don't wish competing coins ill. Just wish and try to make BCH better.""

Did you intentionally leave out the part where he tells the BCH community that they need to learn a lesson implying that try are doing something wrong at the moment? "
[deleted]
Don't know what happened to him but this is a sentiment we can all agree with.
Pointing out that there only two options in Bitcoin Segwit: PoW change or wipe out has **nothing to do with hatred**. It's free education
Totally! 😂
That's the right thing to do. One may have been lied to, turned into a Patsy. Make it by a learning experience. Don't stoop like the low men.
"Guys and gals,

Jihan is selling ASICS and he doesn’t want bitcoin segwit core guys to change pow. Get real. He is doing this to keep his business not out of kindness. I am sorry for him. 

If anyone wants to all crazy towards bitcoin core segwit, please do so. I remind you “bcash”, “btrash”, “chinacoin”, “jihancoin” and so on. This is a brand war and they drew the first blood. 

Thanks. "
"Can't really explain why, but that attitude doesn't seem wise.

Be wary of people who made bad actions in the past: OK.

Assume they are the ultimate evil that can't change: probably not OK."
If BCH stop attack BTC, BCH won't be different from other altcoin. The hope that BCH will replace BTC make it has value.  Business is a war. 
"I feel sorry for those who felt compelled to sell one coin over the other. Some times the safest action may be to take no action.

I support Luke_jr's smaller block suggestion because it would be nice to have a globally recognized blockchain that might be delivered via satellite and perhaps even ham radio broadcast. This small block chain would serve as sort of a world time server where other block chains will publish proofs.

Bitcoin (settlement) may end up serving as an oracle, where chains that require time stamped proofs and trusts make irrevocable statements. Corporate chains, government chains, private chains and even public chains like Bitcoin Cash could say... 'as always, please compare your node/peer list with our most recent Bitcoin (settlement) hash transaction' or 'for proof that we have not re-written our blockchain, please see our public service announcement on Bitcoin (settlement).

Let bitcoin (settlement) serve as an oracle.

Bitcoin Cash may continue with what some feel was the original promise. There is room for both to succeed."
"> by adopting SegWit.

Integrating bad code benefits no one"
SegWit isn't needed when the blocks are 8MB (capable of 32MB if majority of miners agree)
He has been known to play mind games in the past. Otherwise, it is a bit off.
"> They must be destroyed by the abandonment of hashrate.

That will happen all by itself. As the Core folks themselves liked to say: Hashrate follows price.

They have CrippleCoin now, and finally *exactly* what that wanted. Much consensus.

And they won't get anything else."
I agree and salute this change of attitude.
That's the antithetical theme of this sub. Wu is now banned from /r/btc

That doesn't make us any better than /r/Bitcoin 
This is how to do business 
You may be reading into this. His native language is not English. I read it that he is saying the lesson was demonstrated in BTC and is one that BCH should integrate as well.
I think the bch community is influenced by rbitcoin. It's often harder to behave and be gentle than the other way around. Jihan's message is of course targeted to people being tempted to attack segwitcoin.
"This isn’t what he is saying at all.

I believe he is saying the BCH community need to learn a hard lesson from the the failure of SegWit2X, and not to make the same mistakes they did in challenging the incumbent developers of BTC.

He also hopes that the BCH community leaves the BTC community alone and spend their energy on develop and improving the BCH coin and ecosystem."
I don't wish competing coins ill because I own BTC and ETH. It is against my interest if they do badly.
Tell that to all the countries that no longer exist because their governments believed in appeasement. You give, they take, at no point will that relationship reverse.
"Jihan is a fool to preach appeasement. Blockstream core have proven by their lies, their censored forums, their twitter and reddit troll armies, and their funding of anti-scaling conferences that they are not to be trusted.

Assuming honest intentions from these snakes would be failure to learn from our hard won experience. It would be a terrible mistake."
Thank you kind stranger!
Fuck Core. They can go down in flames. 
Seems more like you were implying it would be a flop than predicting it would get cancelled.  Sure, it might be effectively the same result but if someone claimed a football team was going to loose and they backed out of the I sure wouldn't give that person credit for predicting the outcome.
"Wow. Seems like I hit a nerve. Your lame insults merely undermine any rational argument that you have, or may have in the future. I'm not sure how you think you are achieving anything at all, and for sure, if you do think you are achieving something, it's all in your own head. I mean, apart from selfishly feeding your endorphins. ROFLAY. 
"
...
Okay, you got a point there. Maybe my argument was to simplified. But look at situations where there could be bloodshed and conflict and they are actually solved by law and governance. It's always easy to point out the bad examples as a justification why this whole world is a mess. It's called cherrypicking and selection bias, for example about banks being the ultimate evil (yes, this is the rhetorics). But banks have a long history, the youngest history about regulating the monetary system via central banks. There may be crisis, yes, their may be doomprophets, their may be big flaws. But saying that the whole system is corrupt and deregulated, decentralized cryptocurrencies are freeing People in my opinion is a dangerous fallacy. In the end you trust THE MARKET to bring out the better in mankind, you free those people and leave them to unleashed market forces. But there are layers to this market, layers of corruption, of shill and FUD, of interests. Markets can and will always be manipulated. Capital will centralize around the powerful and rich. Be it new rich elites then, but nonetheless elites. See what happens to BTC: It's becoming a new vehicel for the rich to enhance their riches, to get power beyond power, because you don't have to care for regulations. In my opinion it's madness to believe this is for a good cause. And no, I made Money in this market, too. I'm just concerned about the rhetorics surrounding it, about opinions being oppressed, about communication bubbles, about lacking substantials, about People losing their connection to the value of money because it's enough to follow some uneducated shills and manipulators. I hope this will turn out good, but I'm highly concerned right now.

"I disagree with your opinion, but I see you have given it a lot of thought.  The reason I disagree is because the core roadmap takes away Bitcoins key properties: ""P2P"" and ""cash system."" While I typically would agree with your argument about kicking the can down the road, currently the most damaging thing to the network is the fact that there are high fees on the main chain. With high fees Bitcoin can no longer be used as cash, and by forcing layer2 solutions (instead of letting them compete with the main chain on their own merits) such as lightning networks and side-chains we are replacing the P2P element with *trusted* 3rd party intermediaries."
The time I tried make my case for bigger blocks and build consensus for a block increase hardfork I got banned from /r/bitcoin.
"It's been widely recognized for _years_ that unless the block size were increased we would hit a wall and fees would go up. If Core were leaders - as opposed to merely the keepers of the repo keys - they would have guided the community to consensus on a path forward long before we reached that point. They did not.

You're right that there are very few actual ""small blockers."" But there most certainly are people who continue to tolerate the degradation of bitcoin's functionality and the loss of its market share to other coins. Your coin is _dying_ and you're preaching wisdom and prudence.

I'm all for keeping things cordial too. Kudos for that. But there is a lot at stake here and try as I may I can't understand how so many of you still tolerate Core and their heel-dragging. Is it the price? Maybe when there's a big ugly correction some of you will wake up.

Maybe there are a few extremists but the majority of people you’re referring to just believe it’s not wise to support rushed hard forks that lack sufficient consensus. And those same **people believe we should wait and see how all of the layer 2 tech develops before chancing a risky hard fork** that kicks the can down the road and potentially increases centralization. 

This is what small blocker support for your information.

Core have rejected the smallest possible capacity increase at the risk of fucking splitting the currency!!

What make you think a HF capacity will ever happen in BTC??

Are you delusional?

It was the best time to do one, a 2x HF would have reduced fees and seriously reduced BCH appeal and give time for LN or other solutions to mature.

Yet core dev were willing to split the currency on the small capacity increments one can think off..

As a supporter of BCH, core dev just made an incredible gift to us by refusing to compromise...



>Lastly, many of those same people, like me, also got into bitcoin because they were excited about use cases low fees allow like micropayments and reduced cost for remittances market.

Are you joking?

The dev have shown that they are willing to split the currency if things doesn’t go their way? 

Is that ... wise?

It is full on reckless behavior.

>Not to mention that the UI isn’t at a point where it’s usable by most people. It’s mainly speculators at this point and we have time to build.

One is meant to be a currency, one is meant to be a speculative asset.

Do you disagree with that?"

"  People think LN is onchain scaling, because they don't understand it. LN is not what people are expecting, most people think LN is like 100MB blocks, most people don't understand LN is actually off chain transactions, these can be done now as well, these can be done with sidechains and alt. coins. People can do right NOW what LN would make possible after 36 months. That is the epitome of stupidity. 

 People do not want to listen, they waited for SegWit to ""relieve"" the blockchain congestion... it didn't do it... now they wait for LN to ""relieve"" the congestion, but it would  also not do it, because it can't do it. "

"  LN is for the time when there is adoption on a massive scale and LN is not for a congested blockchain. Bitcoin does not need LN, Bitcoin needs bigger blocks. 

 It's like when someone is thirsty... but they give him bread instead... bread would not help... the man needs water, not food. "
it sounds like you should have a gripe with the apps that don't post the deposit limits they're subject to
The failed shifts are due to the blockchain being slow and expensive. Don't use precise. Use Quick.
"Most people in the world cannot afford to transact on the network, and that’s only going to get worse. Merchant adoption is down. Other coins with cohesive communities and effective leadership are gaining ground.

Most of the positives you’ve provided apply to cryptos in general, not just to Bitcoin.

The two words that should have every bitcoiner losing sleep are “substitute goods.”

I derive no pleasure from these observations. Last weekend I sold off my coins including some I held all the way down the backside of the last bubble. I daresay that’s the unhappiest I’ll ever be to bag 2000+% on an investment.

"> Re: the quote about LN fees being paid to ""liquidity providers"" rather than miners. What are these liquidity providers?

LN has 2 use cases. A) Intra channel B) Cross channel.  

A) Intra channel is EXACTLY the same thing as funding a store-specific Gift Card. And you get to fund it precisely one time. So you have to plan your budget ahead... How many gift cards are you going to buy, from who, and how much are you going to tie-up in each one?  
  
B) Cross-channel is trickier. Whenever YOU act as an intermediary for someone else, the amount transiting through you is reduced from your available balance!! It means that: EVERY hop en route to a destination must have the funds available for each transaction. 

There are only 2 waus to solve this problem:  

A) everyone deposits MUCH much more than they need to transact with, or  
B) the system depends on large centralized hubs. LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS

> And how does this affect the holders?  

You have to pay the LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS that will make you whole. There is a difinitive opportuity cost to it, akin to an interest rate, and trust me, they will ask for it. In addition to a fee for the straight transmission of the cross-channel transaction. BONUS: Although it has not been thoroughly discussed, yet, one can see that we have all the pieces in place here for LENDING.

> I understand that miners are pissed about that, but why should the average BTC user or investor care?  

That's not PEER-TO-PEER ELECTRONIC CASH. THAT'S WHY.

> Are you saying LN is opening a backdoor for governments, bureaucrats and/or traditional banks, on purpose?  

With this banking scheme in place, KYC and AML are going to be mandatory, trust me on that. Those nodes will be whales, easy to identify and coerce by the governement.


> I sold my last BTC a few days ago.

Fuching good idea."
"Liquidity providers are parties with sufficiently-capitalized channels open to route payments for other parties as a pass-through. 

The reason this is potentially problematic is that there is a non-zero chance that governments are going to declare this kind of activity a money-service business. "

My exact thinking. As much as I want to believe this, without knowing the source, there's just no way of knowing how legit this is.
Selling Blockstream's CrippleCoin and using BitcoinCash is the only way.

No. Really. This doesn't look like anything. What's so nefarious about this, that they believe in Segwit and the Lightning network? They're very public about that.

This is a standard email to investors, aka people who believe in Blockstream's vision, that outlines what they believe is best for Bitcoin and what is best for Blockstream - and how they plan to help bring those things about.   

People can disagree with them on stuff like Segwit, but they legitimately believe it's a good scaling solution and are open and upfront about that."

"No need to. Everyone has their own opinion on what they think work best, and the market will simply use that which works for them.

For yours.org, that was using bitcoin cash and on-chain transactions."
"**Hashcash**

Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks, and more recently has become known for its use in bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm. The original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"". Later a similar proposal called Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.

I’m actually the biggest blocker ever .
I dont give a shit. I just think you're being a retard if you believe this shit blindly. DOUBLY so if you base your investment on it. 
Yeah, there's no reason for payment channels if you can accept zero conf transactions for instant payments and the fees fractions of a cent.
Next you're going to tell me Core and Blockstream are liars!!
Yes. I meant current team, who vote No2x united as Party says. Core is Congress and Blockstream is Politburo. u/adam3us, fuck u and your $1000 fees, Mr. Chairman )
It is just sad that he implies that he basically invented Bitcoin when in fact he didn't even invent hashcash. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash
Aww some Blockstream/Core boy is sore :(
DKIM plz op
like it took just these emails to know what a piece of shit core is right?
"Ryan X. Charles did a video in which he described that the payment channel code they worked on for months and months and months was abandoned because Bitcoin Cash made it unnecessary. They were able to simply remove thousands of lines of code.

This is why Blockstream is so afraid of on-chain scaling. It destroys their entire business model."
Yes. And it will stay like that for the forseeable future, as the gigablock testnet iniative keeps solving the bottlenecks that prevents effective on-chain scaling.
">And you get to fund it precisely one time

That's the whole banking system again. Unless I understood wrong.

>B) the system depends on large centralized hubs. LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS
This is shit,"
"> LN has 2 use cases. A) Intra channel B) Cross channel.

Well I knew LN had some issues, but holy... I had no idea how stillborn it is.

Thank you for the thorough non-ELI5 yet understandable explanation!"
When you are right, it is more important to be comfortable with your choice than it is to convince others that you are right. Enjoy your tea and weights.
These emails don't really provide any new information. We know BlockStream is a private company. We know they are developing Liquid and LN in house and their goal is to monetize. We also know they contribute to Core development. No one would deny any of those facts. The issue is many people in the crypto community don't understand that relationship at all. For some, they won't care and that's fine, but people should be informed.

Rumormill bullshit like this is dumb,  almost as bad as using your own tweet as a reference when trying to make a point.  
sure. don't be so fucking desperate to believe anything negative. its pathetic.
So the op could have copied and pasted ? What's your point ? Emails are easy to proof - dkim or gtfo
My point is that everything in this possibly-fake letter has been substantiated by Blockstream itself on their own site, Twitter, press releases, etc.
Was just about to say the same thing. OP (/u/increaseblocks) , let's get some headers up in here. Otherwise this is easily faked and plays to our confirmation bias.

"Re: the quote about LN fees being paid to ""liquidity providers"" rather than miners. What are these liquidity providers? And how does this affect the holders? I understand that miners are pissed about that, but why should the average BTC user or investor care?

You can trivially prove the authenticity of these emails via the headers in the email. Otherwise this is not much more than writing text. 
"**Lightning fees are paid to peer-to-peer liquidity providers, and not miners**

Fees are essential for the security of the network as blockreward dwindles, And the best way is to have high volume of low fees. Not a tiny volume of high fees + additionally taking profits away from miners to liquidity providers further reducing network security. In short this does not work, Bitcoin Cash works as Satoshi designed."
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

"This is a good example of the cult-like tendency of r/btc to misread and misinterpret things to contort them into their fruitcake belief system. 

We get it. You really, really hate The Great Satan, Blockstream. Never mind that you can never actually find any evidence of wrongdoing. So instead you trip over yourself with self-contradicting accusations of how Blockstream is using Segwit, which you so bravely resisted, in their evil schemes that they say is not dependent in any way on Segwit, which means... oh bother. It means you don't have anything coherent at all now, right?

Meanwhile, if the unimaginative folks I sparred with yesterday are still imagining that the Lightning Network can't work with a wildly successful Bitcoin blockchain, they will have to cope with this:

(Lightning fees are paid to peer-to-peer liquidity providers, and not miners).""...this would put the miners out of business right and move over to centralized exchanges?"
Where (even in your highlighted sections) does it imply any malicious intent?  If anything, this email professionalizes what Blockstream's intentions are.  It reads like they are doing what's best for the network, not what's best for Blockstream. 
This is capital D Devastating. Game over, finito. But let BS|Axa think things are going as scheduled.  btw r/btc is a goldmine of info to me making right decisions.
Most amazing of all is how they talk like they own Bitcoin. Well, if that doesn't convince the ones who still believe Core is independent from Blockstream, nothing else can, and those people are lost cause.
I don't thiink the mails are fake. looks like standard investor newsletters a startup writes to keep everone informed. Additionally, I don't think the mails were confidential
"I'm pretty sure Yours.org developed a Lightning Network already and are using it on Bitcoin Cash right now for micro-transactions. This is live, not a pipe-dream.

Interesting, fake?
"The fact that this is upvoted to the top of /r/btc is a little embarrassing. Could be real, could be fake, but, probably because the title doesn't mention that there is no proof provided, it's blindly upvoted because it fits the narrative.

you **can not stop the Bitcoin honey-badger**, you can only get on board or get run over"
Don't think taking some fees from miners is a bad thing though.
Not unless the emails were PGP signed or something by keys of Blockstream members then no. There's no way to prove an email is legitimate just from the email message itself.
Yup, those Liquidity Providers^TM . Satoshi's gonna roll in his grave/bed/whereever he is now. 
"> If they just kept improving Bitcoin instead of trying to choke it to force their agenda they would have easily made boatloads of money on the 2nd layer solutions they brought to market (I was excited for them at one time too)

Couldn't agree more, people want money that works for them.
"Yup I was saying this a year ago along with many good people like yourself, of course all I got was ""You dont understand what LN is"". Sure."
"I'd also highlight this snippet:

[..]
> Many of the **SEC concerns are addressed by Blockstream products and technologies**

It's not too much of a stretch to imagine what they might mean by that (regulated KYC/AML LN Hubs^TM anyone?)"
Yeah I think most people simply don't realize how Blockstream is a for-profit company selling a product for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Most people seem to be under the false impression LN is a natural technical innovation from the Bitcoin team.
This is actually more telling.

Congratz to you guys. I personally don't own any Bitcoin Cash neither Bitcoin, full on Ethereum. But I love to see that fast and cheap transactions are winning. Store of value should be also a currency, and you making it right. 
As cliché as it may sound, Ethereum has its uses beyond a currency (while I do believe its value was inflated as a consequence of BTC Legacy 1 MB cap). 
Well, some coins offer things that are not available in  Bitcoin Cash
You are making a valid point however the network effect doesn't respect such things. 
An incumbent is hard to dislodge. Long before it's threatened by an innovative rival, an incumbent can simply adopt the innovation. Maybe Eth has made enough hay during the Bitcoin civil war to be long term credible. 
We all still use MySpace

"> an incumbent can simply adopt the innovation

Maybe tangential to the topic, but do you realize that very soon Bitcoin Core may make a sudden attempt at emergency hardfork raising the block size in order to try to stop Bitcoin Cash (and probably changing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, too)."

Me too. 
In simple terms, BTC's roadmap involves scaling off-chain using 3rd party companies like banks.  BCH's roadmap follows Satoshi's original vision outlined in the whitepaper, which is keeping it decentralized and scaling on-chain.  Blocksize is limited for BTC to eventually force people off-chain to centralized 3rd parties.

The problem is that there isn't really a 'standard' for tickers.  BCC was originally proposed, but not everyone used it - in particular, Bitfinex was forced to choose something different because they were already using BCC for their Bitcoin Core chain split tokens from way back when.  Trezor and Ledger also went with BCH - which seems to be rapidly becoming the ticker that most people use for Bitcoin Cash.
"No thats BitConnect.
Completely separate. I know, that too is confusing.

BitConnect is traded almost on its own platform exclusively, yet I'm sure people sign up for it completely believing it to be BitCoin, even.

Not saying you are by any stretch. Im acknowledging the confusion on the ticker. And it seems whenever Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash are up/down BitConnect follows in a weird pattern.

Edit - to further add confusion, viaBTC used to called Bitcoin (BCC) upuntil basically just now.
Read the comments in there. You can note how everyone talks about BitConnect and the confusion in there.

BCH doesn't have SegWit, RBF, or any other nasty hacks. It has the ability to increase transactions per second and already has 8x the capacity of BTC, and because of that far lower fees. BCH has the bitcoin ledger up until fork time. BCH isn't an altcoin, it is bitcoin."
"That is true.  Coinbase signed the NYA for Segwit2x.  There plan was to add support to at least withdraw BCH by January.  Now that people have reneged on the NYA, it wouldn't shock me to see Coinbase add full support for BCH then too.  If that happens, you would definitely want to own BCH beforehand.

To convert BTC to BCH, you have to use an exchange like Poloniex"

"I should have said 'SEPA region' not 'Europe'. I didn't think many readers would know what I meant.

I didn't actually realize Poland doesn't use the Euro. That's my error.

Can your bank block transfers to other countries? Can't you change bank?"
"I think BCH kinda has the best of both worlds. It originated as Bitcoin so holders of Bitcoin owned it automatically. This means it also has part of the brand name Bitcoin. And it has lower fees, faster confirmations as well as zero confirmation transactions.

There are quite a lot of altcoins out there. I'm sure a number of them have some exciting features and will be either recognized for that in time or have their features adopted by more recognized coins.

Sticking with BTC just doesn't make much sense as Bitcoin cash has both the name Bitcoin and better usability. Bitcoin split and one side of that split just works better."

Will this be feasible long term?  Is BCH really the best for day to day transactions?
Here's me ponting towards *hundreds of altcoins with much quicker blocktimes*.
"> In Europe bank transfers from a consumer to any consumer or business turn up in 1 business day, are free,

Your definition of ""Europe"" does not match with mine :-)  And even within SEPA, this isn't true.  If there is any currency conversion, the bank may not give you a fair currency rate (often a somewhat hidden cost with international bank payments), and from Norway (which is a member of SEPA according to Wikipedia, and de-facto a member of the EU for most practical purposes) one will usually be paying fees for receiving and sending money internationally, though it's cheaper and faster to send Euros within SEPA than other international payments.  If I send USD to Bitstamp, it takes much longer time and cost me more than twice as much in fees as if I send EUR to Bitstamp, even if it's sent to the same bank.  Domestic payments are gratis, in most (but not all) banks.

There is the payment service directive and the payment service directive 2, I'm not sure of the details, but at least I do know that if you're in one of the SEPA Euro countries, the bank cannot charge more for Euro transfers within SEPA than for domestic euro transfers.  So if you have a bank account in France and the bank allows gratis domestic payments, then yes - payments to Germany will also be for gratis.  From Portugal to Poland?  Not sure, there is at least the currency conversion cost.

And sending 100.000 EUR?  May work out, but I think the payment may be frozen if it's not obvious that the money comes from proper ""white"" sources.  My bank does not allow me to send any money out of Norway anymore, as they didn't like my Bitcoin reselling activity."

"I don't think the ""digital gold""-currency is safer, more secure and more liquid than fiat anymore.

Safety and security: the number one risk is a market price crash.  While the market value of BTC has increased a lot over the last year, the utility value has only been going downwards.  That's not sustainable.  If the BTC dumps down to 2015-levels or lower, there is not so much point in the ultra-safe storage.

"These companies are idiots then. Bitcoin is not for dust transactions.

Even with 2MB blocks and a bunch of services using Bitcoin for dust transactions the fees would be the same as they are now because half the blocks would be filled with junk."
Fidelity?
Are you sure you know what 'liquidity' is?  BCH is VERY liquid as you can change to anything in about .5 seconds.  
Fold App?
Sounds totally and utterly completely plausible. I believe your claims about working for a Bitcoin company that is buying thousands of BCH today (and whatever price they are buying at is a huge bargain for such an undervalued wise investment). I am looking forward to all of the re-deployed Bitcoin Cash apps that are waiting just around the corner for us.
They would censor it and only allow false messages about Ver buying all the exchanges and publishing false numbers on them or some such nonsense.
Both would sky rocket if this happens.

There are a lot of companies are building applications based on small bitcoin transactions. They had waited for a bigger blocks (Segwit2x) so they don't have to change their code. But the cancellation of Segwit2x forces them to rethink the plan. So Bitcoin Cash is the best option: less code rewriting.

Don't be bitter sweet. Just read the whitepaper and realize Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin (it even uses the original chain). Price will follow. Then miners will follow. Then 1x dies and we get back our original ticker if we feel like it.

Yes, the mastering Ethereum book is a suiting second book to release after mastering bitcoin... Devs Flocking to use Ethereum yes, but not all the people are working on the protocol itself. It's a Dev tool. That's really why it brings more devs. Bitcoin is not the same. Bitcoin is a store of value. Eth is not a reliable store of value yet.

Two things needed for Bitcoin cash to replace Bitcoin today. First, Coinbase (and other similar exchanges) need to allow direct buying of BCash from fiat. Second, exchanges need to add trading pairs against BCash. For example Poloniex has trading pairs against BTC, USDT and ETH. They need to add pairs with BCH to make it the base trading currency. 
How is the utility of money useless? It's the first human invention allowing for the spawn of societies. Tell me how Ethereums store of value is working out for those people holding the bag for 300 million worth of loses because of a bug. Claiming there won't be other incident like this is impossible.

Developers are flocking to eth so is andreas with his new book coming
"Not necessarily ""ahead"".    The discussion is usually focused on the case where you only have the one transaction you made from the exchange to your wallet, and your single UTXO costs $3 to spend.   

But anyone who actually tries to do business with Bitcoin, or is a regular user (this is what Roger is harping on all the time) ends up with MANY UTXOs.   Bitcoin gets more expensive the more you use it.   I sold half my BTC for BCH yesterday, and spent $300 in tx fees getting the funds to the exchange.  That's about 6x more expensive than an international wire."

"People will now be deciding where to place their effort, Bcore or BCH. The death of B2x makes the choice clear, there is no more path for bigger blocks in Bcore, and no path for on-chain apps in Bcore, nor micropayments, etc., etc.

All those use-cases will now flow to BCH, and the next year will be very big for BCH, because value and demand will flow to those applications that Bcore has forsaken.

Bcore will still grow too, it has institutional moment and its dev path has value of its own, and the government and establishment figures will happily adopt the Bcore model.

But the revolutionary intent of bitcoin is now squarely with Bitcoincash."

That's some good wild guessing lol. Horrible analogy that doesn't make sense. Eth scales x10 worse than btc/bch because of the extra data from contracts alone. You somehow assume no one is working on scaling bitcoin and all efforts go to eth which is wrong. 
"Because BCH is very similar to BTC, and Ethereum is very different. That's a function of path dependence.

Suppose you have a service that was being built to use btc, you can switch it over to BCH with very little additional work.

Not so for ethereum."
I sent bitcoin to another address for 15 cent. It took a few hours to get confirmed, but it did get confirmed. If you need it done faster, just use a segwit address.
