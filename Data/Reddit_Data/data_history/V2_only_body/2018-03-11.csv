Good.
Most of the banning and flagging that has been done against BCH and free speech in crypto proponents have been from core trolls, and it still is. The evidence is all over the place.

Generally: what are the parameters something needs for you to be comfortable using it at money.....so does that technically require a government, or an accountability source.......so, what fees are you paying via credit card, and how has less cash use affected your credit-debit cycles as a business.....so would something returning to ease of use like cash, with cash-like fees, but internet access of credit, be interesting to you

">I am not questioning your claim about what RV said, but your claim that he is BCH's representative.

I know. It's just that I don't really see why RV would lie about this. It's really boils down to this: If Roger is to be believed, he is BCH's representative. If Roger is not to be believed, he can't be said to be BCH's representative.

"
"> it can't go other way, can it?

The author of a project can claim that he is the author, can claim that he is not or can not say anything. Similarly, someone who is not the author of a project has 3 options. Saying something about it and being / not being the author are orthogonal things.

> What sort of evidence are you looking for here?

> What is the total factual proof you'd be satisfied with?

To have a representative of BCH, there should be someone to name it that way. Either the community votes in some way to do that, or there is someone who is the owner of BCH who determines it."
So you're basically calling bullshit on Roger when he calls it his own project while it's not. I see. :)

"Well, if you really *tried* to generate losses, it would be relatively straigthforward and prettey low-risk. The ""1 year"" thing opens a lot of possibilites:

Example:
  * buy 10 alts (and BTC, BCH)
  * wait 11.9 months
  * the 1 or 2 that go up you keep for > 1 year for tax-free profit
  * the ones that go down you sell < 1 year for potentially tax-deductable loss. If you'd like to stay in that particular coin, you can buy it back right away, so no harm done in case it turns out as a good investment.

Of course with this scheme you really *do* suffer those losses, but the idea is that by distributing across many alts and BTC those losses will be offset by the gains of the others view that *do* go up.

The ""Jahresfrist"" is not a good solution if you look at things from ""both sides"", I think: for the Behörden it means a lot of wiggle room for the tax-payer to structure his shit, for the taxpayer it's a huge burden.

If I was any authority I would suggest the following special taxation scheme for cryptos:

  * you pay a flat tax (say 15%) on all proceeds (not just gains) from selling crypto, but only when selling crypto against fiat directly, not when trading altcoins or buying Pizza.

Yes, that would mean you have to pay the 15% when you go ""in"" and ""out"" of crypto (vs. EUR). And yes, it would mean that people could freely (from tax) use crypto as money for payments and they could make all the gains the want from trading crypto against other crypto as long as they don't swap to EUR.

I think both sides would have strong objections against this kind of a deal and that makes me think it might be a good one ;-)
"
"> Never heard that to be the case for fiat. If you hold USD cash and exchange it for EUR at some point later nobody knows when you got it so it is practically very hard to follow through if that would be the case and I am pretty sure it is not.

""Hard to follow through"" has never been an argument not to tax something...

You definitely have to pay taxes if you hold foreign currencies for less than a year.

The document you linked is just talking about the ""umsatzsteuer"" (sales tax). It doesn't touch the subject of capital gains.

No... If you use cryptos to buy stuff there is no extra tax
"Then only spend your old coins and keep the young ones to ""mature"", problem solved."
"1) The Bitpay & Copay wallets are free, and available for all smartphone & laptop platforms.

2) Over the next month or so, other wallets (Bitcoin.com Wallet, Bread/BRD wallet, etc) will likely start supporting BIP70 for BCH.  At that point, people can switch to those wallets. Nobody is locked into anything.

3) There are other payment processors, like Coinbase.com, Coinify (mainly in Europe), etc.

4) All wallets still work with all other payment processors. Just because a wallet supports BIP70 doesn't mean that it can ONLY transact with Bitpay merchants.  Nobody is locked into anything.

5) The purpose of BIP70 is to [reduce errors](https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-and-payment-protocol/).  In order for cryptocurrency to go mainstream, the whole payment process had to progress beyond manual copying & pasting, and manually entering amounts.  In fact, we're headed to a world where people will just put products in their bag, and just [walk out of stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc) without manually checking out or doing anything.

6) When Netscape was the dominant browser, webmasters had to make sure their websites were compatible with Netscape.  Same deal when IE was the dominant browser.  And same deal, now that Chrome is the dominant browser.  

- When a webmaster makes sure their website works with the current dominant browser, their website will still work with other browsers, and it doesn't prevent other browsers from later becoming #1.

- When a wallet maker makes sure their wallet works with the current dominant payment processor, their wallet will still work with other payment processors, and it doesn't prevent other payment processors from later becoming #1.

Keep in mind that we want BCH to be the #1 everyday cryptocurrency.  And in that world, wallet makers will have to adhere to BCH standards & protocols if they want to interact with BCH.  Just like Bitpay's position today.
"
*awesome
No need to be so aggressive lol. No, it's not ideal but if that's what happens better than no adoption at all. And I'm sure they will face some competition from Coinbase Commerce and others...it's not that much of a hassle to add that anyway, I expect other wallets will catch up.
">You definitely have to pay taxes if you hold foreign currencies for less than a year.

Then please point me to the paragraph. EDIT: You are right on this one. Found something. But still this is not the topic we are covering here right now. It is about commerce and using it just like EUR or USD. Not about hodling and gains.

>The document you linked is just talking about the ""umsatzsteuer"" (sales tax). It doesn't touch the subject of capital gains.

This is exactly what we are talking about here. I am not talking about exchanging crypto to fiat but about buying a pizza. And for doing that you do not pay any additional taxes but it is treated as if you would have bought the pizza with EURO. Of course you pay all the relevant taxes that you would do with the EURO like the ""Umsatzsteuer"" (sales tax). "
Pitchforks incoming!
I get that, but since Bitpay has made it mandatory and you don't like it what is your solution?
"Slovenia?

Good for them!"
The solution is obvious: don’t make BIP70 mandatory so you ( the customer ) can pay me ( the merchant ) with whatever wallet YOU would like.
"Damn... yes I guess I completely misunderstood it. Shit.
But hey there is still the 600€ 'Freibetrag'. So buying a pizza with your gains will still be exempt from taxes unless you exceed those 600€ with other trades. Or did I also understand this wrong?

EDIT:
German Tax Law sometimes seems to be more complicated than rocket science."
Slovenid did this. There is no income tax on using crypto, but there is income tax on mined coins.
So what's your solution then? Stop using bitpay and BIP70 wallets which effectively lowers BCH addoption because of some sort of ideaL?

That’s the exact problem, wallets are semi-forced to integrate BIP70, which does actually pretty much nothing really needed right now. It’s a way to get their foot to open the door a little wider. Don’t be naive, these people want profit, nothing else. Trust greed not good intentions.

Once other wallets add BIP70 support it won't be that big of a deal. Yes, competition is always good but if that's the way it is, better to have lots of Bitpay support than no support for crypto and BCH at all

"1) free for now, even if it’s free, I don’t want to force my customers to switch wallets if I were to use Bitpay (which I’m not, and I won’t)

2) those wallets are ‘forced’ to add BIP70, if they won’t, their users will switch wallets when they notice they can’t pay with bread or whatever. So either lose users, or support it. That’s no choice in business.

3) these processors don’t give you insta-fiat which is a NECESSITY for every legitimate business. If you don’t get why, you should start a business and you’ll figure it out.

4) that’s beside the point, I’m not worried because my customers will have BIP70 wallets and they can’t pay at my store because of it. I’m worried BIP70 is a Trojan horse.

5) it was supposed to reduce errors because of address formatting, which already is solved. It has no added value other then locking in merchants and their customers (and the wallets these users use) to Bitpay services.

6) you’re comparing a browser with financial tools, that’s not how it works.

I get how this seems counterproductive in regards to adoption, but in the long run, Bitpay CAN abuse the power this community is giving to them now because of a lack of competition. Conflicts of interest. Trust greed and follow the money. "

"I'm pretty sure you're misunderstanding that document.

There are no *additional* taxes for paying with Bitcoin. That simply means that you don't have to pay VAT when exchanging crypto for fiat. (This only sounds obvious because you're used to it! In a way, it's actually quite surprising that you can buy Bitcoin in Germany without paying VAT on the purchase.)

But you still have to pay taxes on your capital gains. If your bitcoin are worth more when you exchange them for goods than they were when you bought them, you pay taxes on the difference. (Unless you held them for more than 1 year.)

Then again, the standard itself is not really proprietary and it is not going to create a monopoly. Shitty move maybe, but they seem to have adopted cashaddr, which makes me think they are open minded enough. I am also curious. Install Copay and try out a few vendors.*

"Seems like all of takeaway.com's services with bitpay payments can be done using BCH. (lieferando.de is basicly the german version of takeaway.com).

"Awesome!

Yes, all Bitpay transactions need that
yes! just more expensive
Takeaway.com also owns the largest takeaway delivery service in the Netherlands, Thuisbezorgd. Maybe they take BCH now too?
Bitcoin Cash is 9 years old, that’s how forks work so it’s ok for most holders.
"I am pretty sure, that most tax lawyers agree, that BCH is tax free as soon as BTC. The day of the split is not the day you bought BCH, the day you bought BTC is the day you bought BCH.

IANAL but this is what I've been told."
"Except that takeaway is not even close to the biggest 

Still nice tho "
No, this tax only applies when exchanging cryptos to fiat, not when you exchange cryptos for goods. You don't receive fiat and instead pizza so this won't be taxed other than the normal 19% VAT.
This is the German version of takeaway.com, which has been mentioned a couple of times. This also applies to all other versions/countries that takeaway.com is active in such as thuisbezorgd.nl and pizza.pt

I understand that view from a customers perspective, but look at it this way: if all merchants accepting BCH are using Bitpay because there is nothing else right now that can compete in a direct way, wallet developers are either forced to integrate BIP70, which I heard is a pain in the ass, or risk users going to other wallets. In other words: there is no choice from a business perspective. So they’ll do it. Merchants get used to Bitpay, no need in changing something that works so competition is going to have a hard time. What do you think happens when they make another mandatory BIP for their product without any consensus whatsoever after all wallets support BIP70? They get a lot of power by doing this and I, as a merchant, am not supporting it. Newegg is because they don’t care about you or crypto or anything, they care about their dollars. Don’t get greed for more fiat confused with Bitcoin Cash adoption. 
"> Yes, all Bitpay transactions need that

I don't get it... why don't they let you simply pay to an address? It worked with BTC before, no?
"
Did you already have a wallet that supported it or did you have to download one for this purpose after trying with a non-BIP70 wallet?
Cool!
Lieferando.de is great. Great news, now you can demonstrate how well BCH works by ordering Pizza with BCH when together with friends :)
">Bitcoin Cash is 9 years old, that’s how forks work so it’s ok for most holders.

Some merchant uses bitpay, huge news really.
People are voting with their''feet''. No longer talking about adoption they are simply aligning with the economic incentive. The original blockchain is not just surviving anymore. Its THRIVING
Sadly you are wrong. If you hold the BCH/BTC less than a year, you have to pay taxes for any gains. (Or you can use losses to pay less taxes for other capital gains).
If not the largest in Europe
