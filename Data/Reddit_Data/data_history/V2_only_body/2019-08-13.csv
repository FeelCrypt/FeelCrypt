"It is absolutely stupid to fight for it when:

1) BCash has less than 1/15th of the total transaction volume

2) Every major (and minor) exchange refers to BTC as the original Bitcoin

3) No major news outlet recognizes this neither 

It is just stupid for even more reasons than those 3.  The more time spent fighting for Bitcoin Cash to usurp the name “bitcoin” — the less time is spent on marketing Bitcoin CASH positively, and on top of that, it’s pretty much known that this “marketing” in this channel is affecting you guys negatively.

Basically there’s a bunch of babies here with their hands over their ears, with their eyes closed, stomping their feet.

Edit: Bitcoin is not a variant of Bitcoin — Bitcoin is Bitcoin — how in the world can something be a variant of itself???  Dumb

Edit 2: Your response to the Chef question shows how poor your logic is."
What are the tech talk ratios for r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency?
"See, one of the reasons why a lot of us are in to crypto, is because we understand that incentives, and hard-coded rules trump intentions, rules written on paper or legislation or social norms which can't be enforced or would cause far more disutility to adequately enforce than having them go unenforced.

It's not worth yours or anyone else's time to try to socially reinforce a reddit rule which never has, and never will be followed by anyone else, nor am I convinced that this forum would be better in any way if people did magically follow that rule.

Edit: that's not to say that I don't often upvote really bad or wrong comments, which were made in apparent good faith...but that's especially to ensure that the response and correction to their wrong ideas gets visibility."
"> Do you even use LN?

I executed myself around hundred (or more) LN transactions.

Fees per entire transaction, in satoshi, in randomly picked recent ones

* -1

* -2

* -0.1 so like 0.1/160 = 0.00062 sat/byte (just to a random web shop)

* 0 !

* 0 !

* -320 (that was when sending over 500,000 sat, and still it is just like 320/160 = 2 sat/byte)

* -1.04

* -1.02

* -1.51

* -12

* -25

* -2.01

* -7

* -26

* -1.1

All tiny payments that is below 500 sat in my recent history cost less than 3 sat per TX - so that is like if 3/160 = 0.018 sat/byte, amount that is not possible at all to achieve onchain, aslo not in BCH."
Bitcoin is not an altcoin. That sub is talking about a new project.
I understand marketing and branding — and what you guys do on here is a shit show.  And all this taking advantage of being decentralized to sell BCash snake oil hurts Crypto as a whole.
couldn't you at least take your time and make a diagram, that actually mirrors reality and isn't pulled out of your biased opinions ass? And you keep missing those people in your diagram who constantly make threads like you. That's literally the first thing I see, when I come on Reddit. Someone trying to tell me exactly your BS.
"I don't care enough about ANY subreddit to give a shit about who's doing what in different subreddits.  

A commercial advertisement eh?  But no problem with Roger/egon's dozens of weekly posts telling people to go ""buy bitcoin""  on bitcoin.com?  Err.. not that bitcoin, the bitcoin I'm sellin...

Good job keeping on the reddit mods to make sure they are doing their jobs right, whew.  

Yeah, censored or banned... I'm done replying because I'm rate limited here because Super RES auto TROLL tagger 9000 is keepin me from saying how much I think BCH is a cheap knock off of bitcoin.

You better cryptocheck everyone so you can see their karma in crypto subs.  Holy shit is that useful!"
I didn't even directly call anyone a troll. You just flew off the handle and did so in a way that is far more unbecoming than the standard you wish to create here.
"So every time someone coopts the name we're using, we just have to give up?

Bitcoin has made a name for itself as being this new digital currency for the internet and ""against the establishment"". Why would we start from scratch because the project's centralized points of control (github, reddit, bitcointalk) were seized? Bitcoin is more than that."
"I never said BCH and BTC should be equal in any way.

Both are variants of Bitcoin though. 

>This would be like if the chef of a Chinese restaurant left and started  his own restaurant, but fought to keep the previous owners name.  It’s  stupid

Why? He's (a significant part of) the reason people came to that restaurant.

The difference is: legally, only 1 person/company can hold the rights to a trademarked brand name. That's not true for the name Bitcoin because it's not trademarked. 

Bitcoin is a good name to have because so many people have heard of it. It's not stupid at all to fight for it."

I get my comments removed every time I tell noobs why the fees are so high.
"Well, no that's not exactly what I meant.  I meant that it's difficult to see the forest for all the turds.

Want to learn about BCH? Good luck getting through the mountain of shit first.

Like I said, great project.  Less than great community."
I understand what you're saying, but consider I've been here for many years under new accounts due to op sec and I know that I have never called you a paid shill. It's not just about sub activity and karma, that's obviously a key thing but it's not the only reason it's so obvious that Egon is paid to do what he does here. You look like an obsessive enthusiast, much like myself, Egon has a TOTALLY different vibe.
I doubt, otherwise he would not bring the cheapness of txs as an argument when they can be made just as cheap on chain, if the volume allows.
"1 BCH = 1 BCH no matter how much you cry; 1 BCH will never equal 1 BTC. 

This would be like if the chef of a Chinese restaurant left and started his own restaurant, but fought to keep the previous owners name.  It’s stupid

Edit: not that they should be monetarily equal, but the fact that people are using them interchangeably... and renaming coins “bitcoin core” etc ...

I can call Lebron James “Lebron Core” all I want, but that’s not going to change his name, or my name, unless I go and get it done for myself.  But BCash doesn’t have any control of what Bitcoin is called.. so it’s just dumb that they do so much of that here."
"If you, ""don't care enough about ANY subreddit to give a shit about who's doing what in different subreddits,"" why did you even come here to say this:

> Of course they censor posts about bitcoin cash, it is a fucking altcoin. The sub is r/bitcoin. There are other subs for other topics, such as /r/Bitcoincash

That was your whole comment and it's literally only discussing ""who's doing what in different subreddits.""

>  But no problem with Roger/egon's dozens of weekly posts telling people to go ""buy bitcoin"" on bitcoin.com? Err.. not that bitcoin, the bitcoin I'm sellin...

I don't know why you assume I don't have a problem with anything Roger or other people post in this sub.  I don't like everything they post, and I downvote things occasionally.  I haven't made any assumptions about you.  I don't know why you assume so much about me.

"I don't know?  Nor do I care.  I'm not a mod there. Doesn't liquid have something to do with bitcoin and the lightening network?  Do people supporting liquid or tether say they are the ""real bitcoin"" constantly, while squatting bitcoin.com?

I find it amusing when people from this sub pretend they don't know why they catch so much shit from the crypto crowd.  Its as disingenuous as can be.

"Not people, Morty. Shills.

You said go to hell and called me a troll. You're what you seek to eliminate.
"> I can always peer to anyone else.

No, you can't.  That's the meaning of hub and spoke.  You have to go through a hub you're connected to with pre-arranged liquidity.  

But you're right that most people don't care.  Eventually though, I hope that p2p cash systems will outcompete banking systems like LN.  It's probably inevitable.

Do you even use LN?"
"L-BTC (Liquid BTC) is a centralized Bitcoin ""side chain"" run by Blockstream.  Liquid is a network that runs on top of L-BTC (in my understanding, they use the terms somewhat interchangeably) and supports other tokens/assets.  In this case, it's Tether.  None of those things are Bitcoin.  They are, by any definition, altcoins.  Blockstream recently took Liquid [down for 12 hours](https://twitter.com/BlockstreamHelp/status/1159210378255110150?s=19) for a ""scheduled upgrade"" that was not pre-announced to users.  So yeah...it's centralized, not-trustless, and not-Bitcoin.

> I find it amusing when people from this sub pretend they don't know why they catch so much shit from the crypto crowd. Its as disingenuous as can be.

You don't find it disingenuous for r\bitcoin to say that they only allow Bitcoin discussion, but they regularly allow discussion of non-Bitcoin things?  This particular instance was particularly bad because it was literally posted by a corporate Blockstream account.  This was effectively **a commercial advertisement** on r\bitcoin for a service that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  I reported it, but the mods chose to ignore the report and allowed it to stay up.

I would never claim that things are perfect with Bitcoin Cash, but at least we can *discuss* these sorts of issues over here without being censored and/or banned.  You may complain about Roger owning bitcoin.com, but does Blockstream own r\bitcoin?  I have to wonder."
Don’t think he’s paid, just particularly committed to the cause
"Thanks for showing your true colors. 

I have no interest arguing further with someone who doesn't understand the basics of decentralized governance.

"I have almost 200K karma almost all from rbtc and I assure you I've never taken a red penny from anyone here.

The only exception to that was that I made some t-shirts a couple of years ago that I sold, but I tipped out all the revenue.

TBH you couldn't pay me enough to hang out here and do what I do, if I didn't already want to do it. But I'm passionate about [Bitcoin: a Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) and I witnessed [this](https://archive.is/TkUus) and [this](https://archive.is/TkUus) and [this](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and lots of other shenanigans, so I feel pretty motivated to keep doing what I'm doing.

So... don't be so sure someone's paid to talk about something they truly care about.

What's much weirder to me are the ones who are here 24/7 hating on something. There's a word for people who define themselves by what they hate and take pleasure in aggravating others. So either these people are getting paid to troll, or they get off on it, which is probably even more pathetic."
Yes... and no. That may be true, but justice isn't involved, and not our goal.
"It's not that protocol doesn't matter. It's that protocol is not the bottleneck. The bottleneck is creating useful applications on Bitcoin. BCH devs can build 100TB blocksize, with the most perfect wallet, and perfect nodes, and perfect protocol. It doesn't matter... The blocks are empty. The protocol is not the bottleneck. Respectfully, the BCH protocol-related devs may as well be digging holes in the ground.

Bring in millions of users dependent on blockspace, and we will have 100x more protocol devs than we do now. The most important component to scaling the protocol is user demand. This demand is what will pay for the protocol devs. The same way increased speculation demand created 1000 Bitcoin exchanges in the last 5 years."
"Are you OK? Your response is far more uninviting than anything I've ever posted here. You're a massive hypocrite to call me a troll too.

Been here since the beginning. It's always been this way and we're not losing any ground or going away any time soon."
"No man. Everytime I come on reddit, the first ting I see is someone telling me exactly the same shit like OP. This concern has some merit and is valid but you guys make it much bigger and worse with this constant focus on the posts, that you'd like to disappear.

While I myself try my best to not suspect everyone as a troll and not partake that much in shitting on BTC or downvote people for their opinions, I would still like to ask you to take a step back and to convey to you, that there are indeed enough smart people, who can get their information or have or follow a reasonable discussion, if they so chose to. This over-sensitive focus on what is supposedly happening is just like the diagram of OP, subjective at best."
Some conspiracies are true. This sentiment has existed since this sub was created. BTC has been sabotaged and whether you believe it has happened out of ignorance or malice is irrelevant to me.
Every heard of I'm a Mac commercials?

There’s certainly no guarantee that it’s going to win anything. Especially when the community is as toxic as it is today and development is chronically underfunded. That’s why I think that improving the culture here is so crucial.
Bitcoin tends to have green associated with it these days. I still like the old orange though. I also prefer btc as a short but the ticker at exchanges is bch. Speculators would be confused but no need to change the name of the subreddit.
"It was founded to point out the rbitcoin flaws, because it was not possible to do it in rbitcoin, which is heavily censored. When even rbtc wasn't able to turn the tide, we split it off.

Now it's done, we do not have anything left to do with them. We went our separate ways.

Same thing happened with CSW. He did not like it. He's now gone, we don't hear about him anymore, good riddance.

Let's focus on ourselves, on our community."
"The reason I speak is to defend the eyes of new crypto enthusiasts (2019 and on) coming to the sub.  When I first found this subreddit a while back it’s because I was searching for subreddits related to bitcoin.  Bitcoin alone, not bitcoin private, not 0xbitcoin.

I even read the sub description and it says for conversing on all things *bitcoin*

After observing and observing, I found that this entire sub is dedicated to bitcoin cash.  And bitcoin cash users claiming that bitcoin cash is truly bitcoin, and Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core

This is complete shit for the entire community, it makes you guys look like a joke in here.

Imagine now, a person that sees “bitcoin accepted here” and they are now literally confused because of all the crap in here

This is why I fight on making the r/BTC subreddit about bitcoin.  Because if someone sends BCH to BTC address, they are screwed."

Probably why they were on the verge of bankruptcy until they finally decided to innovate.
Hardly. Maybe some times, but even some of us who have been around for a long time can't help but think that new adopters, and the general public, do not care. I find it hurts adoption if we look like the conspiracy theory group.
"u/emergent_reasons

99.99% of people don't care about Bitcoin

99.99% of people don't care about Bitcoin Cash

99.99% of people only care about how you are going to save them money.

Build apps that save these people money, and they will come in droves.

BCH has more than enough developers to build these apps. The challenge is not developers. BCH has plenty of developers. The challenge is we haven't figured out what these developers should be building. For God's sake, half of BCH developers are still tinkering around with base protocol stuff... I promise you the 99.99% of people do not care about theoretical protocol changes."
"Go to hell. You and your cronies are destroying this place and any time anyone tells you to stop, that maybe smearing your fecal matter on the walls and windows isn’t hygienic and isn’t good for our public image, you call them a concern troll. 

I think it’s much more likely that YOU are the troll, and that you’re ruining this community by willfully encouraging anti-social behavior. If I wanted to psyop BCH, that’s what I’d do. I’d turn its social forums into a negative, unproductive, narcissistic, paranoid shit-show that scares away investment and talent. And that’s precisely what you’re defending."
Not fungible. Not even monero is. How to fix for good? Becoming important.

/r/bitcoin does remove lies. That is what you call banning and cry about.
"Crypto in general has a problem with that because people are afraid of it being unregulated and volatile, as well as being afraid that the government will try to regulate or outlaw if. (The irony)

There’s not much that can be done on those fronts other than say “we are the best crypto coin” to try to increase adoption and by saying “look at how fast our transactions are” to make people believe it could be used to transact. Everything seems like it’s on the right track to me.

I thought you were saying that there is a technical researchable problem with bch that needs r&d, but if that’s not the case they are doing all they can."
"""BCH should do the same"" implies that are currently just sitting around all day shit talking."
"> Build apps that save these people money

Or that make Bitcoin truly fungible. That would be THE upgrade in BCH."
"It's the best there is which is why I mentioned it but even that is not quite quite there. With KYC of others forcing people to reveal affairs far into the past, plus the relatively low volume of Monero, plus this: 

https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/

""Before a recent change from Monero's developers, that timing analysis correctly identified the real coin more than 90 percent of the time, virtually nullifying Monero's privacy safeguards. After that change to how Monero chooses its mixins, that trick now can spot the real coin just 45 percent of the time—but still narrows down the real coin to about two possibilities, far fewer than most Monero users would like.""

...and you have users not using the same way they would use cash."
That’s what the online community seems to do.
"Your response is wheeled out every single time that someone calls the culture into question. It’s a way of casting aspersions on any self-criticism. It’s hugely unproductive, and destructive. 

If you’ve been around here then you should know that guy is certainly not a concern troll. He’s one of the most passionate, positive, and visionary people who posts here."
I respectfully disagree.
"That level of ignorance is unlikely. It was most likely malicious, but could just represent a very different world view.

This is really irrelevant to adoption though. If we want to push BCH adoption then we should care to some degree about the marketing aspects. Let's not look like conspicary theorist nutjobs."
"""hey pc, what can you do besides spreadsheets? Oh that's right nothing you dork!"""
Yep and you might recall that wasn't the Mac that really pulled them out of the down spiral.  It was the iPod and iPhone.  When they released these products, they didn't need to make ads like that any more as the products spoke for themselves.
I was definitely a big blocker in the BTC civil war, but BCH seems less and less relevant each passing day. Most people here are just beating a dead horse.
"Of all the ""Paid shill"" talk that used to go on here,  u/egon_1 is the most obvious paid shill on the whole of reddit.

yeah, would be a lot less shitting on BTC, if they'd be a tad more honest and less offensive themselves.

"Sure, I can agree that bitcoin costs a lot per transaction.  Which truly means that if bitcoin is that repulsable, Bitcoin Cash would want to create **more** space between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin, rather than blur the lines as most do in this channel.  

It’s these type things that hurts Bitcoin Cash more than it does Bitcoin, if you truly think about it.

Bitcoin is the big brand and people are used to seeing the smaller fish pray off of the whale brands.  It’s best for Bitcoin Cash to tout its greatnesses on its own rather than insist *hey, it’s **actually** bitcoin* — bad marketing"

It seems that too many people in this subreddit don’t actually care about Bitcoin Cash’s success. They live for the memes, the conspiracy theories, and signaling their solidarity in resistance through shit posting about Core and Blockstream.

There are VCs out there dumping money on anything with ""blockchain"". Go for it man. It's a little annoying for everybody working on projects and products to get shit on as being clueless."
"Discussing something doesn't prevent others to discuss something else. It's free to create a new discussion.
