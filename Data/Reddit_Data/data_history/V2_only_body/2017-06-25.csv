"I'd suppose users want the price to grow as well, because they hold btc after all. They just don't want it to be as volatile.

Traders surely like volatility, but how could they exploit that in PoS? If they vote e.g. on competing chains, PoS punishes them by using security deposits.

Sure Lightning will add a PoS element on its own layer. I've been asking Greg and Adam about the Blockstream business model multiple times, my impression is: Same as some other decentralised projects like OpenBazaar, they don't really have one. The rationale is: If we build something big and useful, we'll eventually find ways to monetise that, same as Facebook did. So they have the luxury of toying with interesting academic concepts without having to worry about user adoption too much. Which isn't beneficial for Bitcoin's market position either.."
