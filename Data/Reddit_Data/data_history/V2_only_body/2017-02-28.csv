But what if you paid $25,000? The suggested fee would probably be 0.066%. That's a steal
Then why mention it?
"The original idea says that the store of value is has diminished value if you can't use it later. You then brought an anaology to show why that was the case; but instead of choosing a good with an artificial transaction ceiling, you choose a normal good, whose transactions could scale with demand. In doing so you ignored the point of what you were replying too amd dimished the value of your metaphor."
Alright bud. Real estate is totally more liquid than bitcoin. Good one
This is exactly what the 'core' wants. For you to NOT use bitcoin. They are being paid to kill bitcoin, if that's not obvious to everyone by now.
It's not though. It's the same thing. Both are stores of value independent of your concerns
As long as BTC price keeps going up, many people don't care.
ETH does not possess the traits of ideal money. I had some but minimised my holdings since then.
Fair enough... Let me know when you switch over to ETH ☺️
"In the short term, getting SegWit activated will allow more transactions per block -- possibly bringing fees down significantly.  But as Bitcoin usage grows demand for block space will overload even that increase.

But what SegWit also delivers is a solution to transaction malleability.  With transaction malleability solved, it is easier to implement off-chain solutions (e.g,. Payment Channels).  And that's where we essentially can return to having low cost transactions.

The quickest path there is to get SegWit activated."
"from what client or exchange? i sent one bitcoin (~$1180) last night from my ledger wallet and suggested fee was 40 cents.   Transaction went was confirmed within 10 minutes.

I have never seen a case where it wasn't similar to my above experience, regardless of quantity or wallet or exchange and I have been using bitcoin since late 2013"
I'm saying that your analogy is a bad one, not that property is a better or worse store of value than bitcoin.
lol, read the twitter thread, and it's much less sensational, but much more hilarious. it's a fail on behalf of the wallet he's always advertising for so obnoxiously in his show.
I paid $1.46 today for a transaction.
It's not insane and it isn't broken. You are completely aware of the mechanism behind why the fee might be that high, yet you feign ignorance in order to justify your indignation and you pretend to be a victim in order to gain support for your agenda.
It'd be the same exact situation with 10MB blocks. Instead of 3TPS you get 30TPS! wow massive scale! It surely won't have a huge mempool and high fees /s
The problem isn't with a store of value. You are just redirecting the conversation to the typical talking points around here
If it doesn't do you lose the bitcoin?
Because minnesota
"Go hang out at [Voat](https://voat.co/).

Regardless of what anyone thinks of them, those users have a much greater appreciation of censorship resistance compared to most social media users."
care to elaborate?
"Objectively too high implies theres a place its supposed to be, doesnt it? so where would you say its supposed to be?

And im still not getting what youre saying about competition. Competition generally means more people competing for your dollar so they offer competitive prices and you get a better deal."
No, but you may have to wait several days for the tx to get dropped from the mempool.
"> the priority of transactions increases with age.

I don't think miners use priority anymore. I think coin age was a way to prioritize transactions before transaction fees were common. Now there's enough fee paying transactions  miners just prioritize based on fees.

"
"To answer your question, technically yes as your transaction ages however there is a lot of ""ifs"".

If your fee is too low, it won't ever get broadcasted to a miner to start with.
If your fee is too low, you have the miners might never accept the tx in their mempools.
If your fee is too low, you will have to rely on your tx aging before getting mined (and some miner do not implement this mechanism anymore)

"Real Estate amalogy doesn't work. It would if you imagined a government agency restricting the amount of titles processed to some small number. 

In order to get a true analogy you need a system that has limited use far below demand like taxis with medallion systems. "
so Bitcoin is for the rich kids? 
"> See, the thing is though, lets say that fee was objectively too high (which, for the record, it cant be, there is no objectively correct amount).

Fees can be objectivily too high because of competition. While in the short term it's tough to use alternative currencies, that's rapidly becoming not the case. 

While not every use casehas an objective ""too high fee"" a number do."
You ignore competition.
"> Objectively too high implies theres a place its supposed to be, doesnt it? so where would you say its supposed to be?

Generally, within one stamdard deviation of it's competition.

> And im still not getting what youre saying about competition. Competition generally means more people competing for your dollar so they offer competitive prices and you get a better deal.

Im saying that competition between cryptos means that the factors you identified will be more acute."
Arguably, actually not fair at all!
"This is really going to get upvotes when everyone here knows full well that's just the wallet software being retarded?

How droll."
I'm not sure what your objection is. Are you saying that Satoshi did not intend for Bitcoin to facilitate low value transactions and that I somehow misrepresented his intentions here?
You are correct.
"That's the problem with a lot of examples, regulation is different the world over. It makes these debates difficult.

I think we aim for ideal: Almost Free, Instant, Secure, Fungible, Anonymous transactions.

"
"> Id settle for the specific sequence of mental gymnastics you performed. Tell me how you arrived at this conclusion.

Statistics mainly. Things (like fee prices) are going to fall under a normal distribution around the ""optimal"" price for an use case. If bitcoin is within a stamdard deviation of it's peers it will find good use. 

> If the competition is ""better"", then go use it?

People are. Already there are people rewriting systems to pay out in alts instead of bitcoin."
"If your not introducing an artificial limit on supply, then the analogy doesn't work. 

You can't ignore the key problem and claim your analogy works."
Not true in USA at least. Write a check and record a deed transfer and it is sold. 
Exactly. Part of the purpose of Bitcoin is to facilitate low-value transactions at a low cost. If $10 million can be sent cheaply, we've still sacrificed the other purpose which Bitcoin was supposed to solve directly.

"I bet fees at any given moment could be represented by some sort of recursive function representing a feedback loop.

Not a pun, sorry. :-("
"""transfer money with almost no fee""

that's what I used to tell people to get them to try to use bitcoin. too bad..."
Why not use GDAX?
The analogy works perfectly well. We don't have to twist the analogy around so you can try to get in your big block catch phrases. 
The transaction fee is based on size, not amount. High fees only make low value transactions expensive in terms of % fee. 
Real estate is enormously expensive to liquidate in some places, especially when you account for time & effort.

Yeah I was going to sell some and saw the fee and decided it wasn't worth it currently. Just too much.
"XCP is an interesting contract platform, I havn't used Counterparty in some time myself though.

It isn't that I don't think that is the case as much as /u/insette is spamming the forums inappropriately with that link trying to pump XCP and also lashed out at me personally earlier as well with a bunch of nonsense. I never even brought up Counterparty, then this sperglord starts twipping out on points I never brought up and putting words in my mouth while explaining he is indeed an XCP bagholder with Ethereum hate."
