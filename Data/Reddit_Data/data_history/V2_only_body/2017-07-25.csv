"This seems fair: if you sign up to an agreement, you sign up to all of it.

If 2X doesn't activate, a lot of people will, in my opinion, be losing a lot of faith in BTC. I'll be one of them. Not because I have any particular support for 2X or any particular problem for Segwit, but because it shows fickleness and underhand moves based on politics not sensible technical decisions."

ASICBoost is patented independently by multiple companies and individuals . The moment someone mines overtly,They would open themselves to legal recourse and have a huge PR problem for exploiting a security vulnerability within bitcoin as described here - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=+CVE-2017-9230
"Who would want to roll in the mud with you? You have no knowledge of Bitcoin, only an inflated perception of the pseudo-scientific bullshit you keep spreading.

You might have been part of Bitcoin long enough to afford a 20k USD full node, but you sure seem not to have wasted a single day on learning anything of substance.

Though integrity is clearly a trait that you have proven to lack.... I truly hope you stick to your word and fork off with your constant shitcoining once 2x is rejected."
Even if I were to start debating (which is mainly for politicians, not the real world), I would only be willing to debate someone competent to represent a legitimate alternate position anyway.
"Well said!!!

Sorry Luke if you decline Roger's invitation he will name it as he wants, you should show Bitcoin Jesus some respect!!!!

What does Blockstream have to do with Segwit2x? It's not a Core movement so what's your problem? 
Who's going to sue him, you?
"> You can't be serious. facepalm

Everything  is about Bitmain, their 80% of mining, the mining being fully in China, and about they using PATENTS to enforce asicboost, while we real Bitcoiners will remove that shit with SegWit.

Do you support patents now?"
O look another idea from roger ver
Why would I waste my time arguing with liars and fools?  Besides, Roger didn't bother to defend his claim anyway.
[deleted]
"It's not debunked you moron. There is no question they hold the patent. 

However the whole asicboost being used topic is not debunked. On the contrary there had been recent evidence supporting its use. "
It's not properly tested.  That's the point.  And it probably won't be by three months from now.
[deleted]
"Well, unless the price completely crumbles before the fork of course.

But other than that, I can't really imagine a scenario where it would make sense for them to just leave their fate to chance."
Normalmoron
Why?
"Does that mean that it would then be more easily subject to a 51% attack? If the difficulty lowers, it should be easier to produce blocks and double spend a coin by splitting the chain into two...
Isn't there an incentive to wait for the difficulty to lower (or actively waiting by doing a ddos on the nodes during enough time) and then attack the chain with this algorithm? What do you think? Thxs"
It won't reduce difficulty until 12 hours have passed? That is quite a slow chain. Surely there is a difficulty reset at the point of fork?
But it takes serious balls to put all or most of your money behind that. Never going to happen. Not even Ver is this crazy. 
"why from the start?

bitcoin wasn't what it was from the start. It didn't even have value in the beginning. People came together to volunteer their time/energy into building the ecosystem. Many did this for free.

BCC will be attacked by core for sure. It'll be the most attacked crypto in history. And that's why it'll be the best. Getting stronger each time. "
"if the market can't come up with their own optimization to compete, we should nerf everyone to a fair level field , right?

I bet you wouldn't feel that way if it was blockstream with the hardware advantage. "
">To survive it has to be a *serious* competitor from start.  

Why from start?

Even if the Bitcoin cash chain is completely asleep until the 2MB HF deal get broken.. no problem..

The exchange rate of Bitcoin cash will be near zero you tell me?

And I suspect many will."
The whole point is to maintain the blockchain without contamination by segwit. That would be far too late. Unless I misunderstood what you are saying?
No one gives a toss if a miner finds a way to mine faster. It's competition. It's not a change or a security risk or anything. If another miner finds a way to mine faster are you going to say they shouldn't be able to as well? This crusade against asicboost is pure contrived nonsense.
"> If you can't find it, search again. I don't have time to inform you

Does it? Show us the links / documents for it."
[deleted]
I am not sure you understand what you are talking about.
Properly tested doesn't mean losing bitcoins. We are talking about servers crashing or exchanges having difficulty. Changing the max blocksize will not cause you to lose bitcoins in a transaction.
If it wasn't properly tested and vetted it shouldn't have been put forward as part of a compromise agreement on what has become a highly charged debate.... that's just asking for trouble and I'd seriously question the naivety of those who made the agreement if that is the case
"At this point, the exact block height when the 2x part will activate is know.

Instead of actually running the btc1 client which has lots of other code changes, I'm certain that a patch will be made to slap on top of core that will just accept larger blocks (8mb block weight) at that specific block height.

A simple change like that can be tested very easily."
"> Any serious Big Block Miner will point some hashing power to BCC. Don't doubt that. They have little other choice.

7 Ph at the moment; 0,1% of the hashing power. I hope you are right, but I also hope that the pool admins themselves will do it as well. I smell a suicidal 'wait and see' approach.

BitcoinABC reduces the difficulty if it takes more then 12 hours to find a block. This way even if it is slow it can survive.
"To survive it has to be a *serious* competitor from start.  

I can't tell you precisely what that means, but it certainly includes  

* a working client implementation
* one or two big exchanges
* enough nodes to make any DDoS useless
* a hashrate big enough to make a 51% or any other kind of delay/orphan/empty blocks attack futile

"
"Communication-wise that would be terrible. It's like reverting all transaction that happened to this point, while a chain split clearly communicates that there are 2 ""truths"" of tx history"
Yes, but if it gets low enough it would be trivial for it to be attacked. You want at least enough difficulty to make an attack costly.
It does, but with the current implementation it will still take at least 20-25 weeks to reach the next normal difficulty adjustment and until then the chain will barely be functioning.
"~~Because Segwit activates August 1st.~~ Because Segwit transactions will start showing up on the chain ~2 weeks after Segwit locks in.

If you don't fork before then, there will permanently be Segwit transactions in the block chain, and thus you will have to keep soft fork code around that understands and validates Segwit transactions for all of time."
">So then why was August 1st chosen?  

To avoid the so-called ""opt-in"" Segwit virus.  Thanks to Segwit as a soft fork, now we have to hard fork. Great job!   "
It's open source, not a management company.  This will happen with ETH and it will happen with any other crypto that rises should BTC burn, as long as that crypto is really open source and decentralized.

"> Because, unfortunately, people like Ver actually keep to their word.

 No, he virtual signals to be ancap, while he supports shitty coin that uses patented Asicboost.  Do you support patents now, guys?

Asicboost patent - will be used on Bitcoin ABC / Bitcoin ""Cash""
https://www.google.com/patents/CN105245327A?cl=en

While the good guys at Block Stream do not use patents: they actually release anything that can be patented, to use for anyone without any charge or risk of being sued in future:

https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge/

""Blockstream offers all of its patents and patent applications under the Defensive Patent License, version 1.1. That means the technology covered by Blockstream's patents is freely available for use without having to pay a licensing fee or risk litigation""
"
"Divorces in open source are quite common. They tend to catalyze progress because of competition, which is a good thing. 

There's nothing wrong or hopeless about BCC. "
"Who are these moderates? I don't think there are many of them. There may be a large number of low-information users but they will go with whatever works and has support at the end of this.

I think that the BCC / no-segwit-softfork chain will have greater long term value and utility than a contaminated chain. That would be a net benefit for the majority.

Assuming BCC fails, the s2x chain will go ahead and we will see what happens. I don't think the s2x chain would suffer any long term damage due to BCC in that case.

Overall, I think you are overestimating the risk of the fork and underestimating the potential gain. All the real players know the game and that the chips are in the air. The moral high ground is arguable depending on perspective."
"> it removes patented asicboost for example

It doesn't."
God, enlighten this idiot, please. He still buys that funny propaganda of BSCore!
The users have shown support only for the second half. They overwhelmingly voted for a blocksize increase.
"It doesn't need an exchange from the start, Poloniex didn't start trading ETC until three days after the fork.  User demand gradually brought exchanges on line one by one.

To paraphrase Grand Moff Tarkin - Fear will bring the exchanges in line,
fear of leaving money on the table."
"Hey, if it's so great, why not roll it out as a much simpler hard fork? Surely everyone will race to upgrade to it. 

I never preached a doomsday scenario. I'm simply preaching against forced acceptance of changes to my money that I never signed onto. On that we should all agree."
Yeah it's not like those dates could ever... *change.*
">Segwit doesn't cause a hard fork

Correct, instead, it is a coercive soft fork that attempts to change the economic properties of my coins. Those of us who oppose it as an engineering and economic failure must opt-out through a hard fork."
I spent two years working full time for an open source project.  This one is different.  Everyone has a vested interest.  And this open source project is all about money.  It totally changes the dynamic.
"Well that's beside the point, though. The community came to a compromise, and BCC is setting itself up to be dependent on its supporters breaking faith first.

That's an extremely dangerous game to play. It gives up the moral high ground, which will alienate the btc moderates."
"what a well-structured and presented argument. any sources?

Y'all are succeeding in making your community look pathetic and naive. No one is responding to this guy's arguments with anything substantive. Easy for people on the fence to decide who is in the right. "

Liar.

"> ""Let's make CT txs 50x slower to validate so we can sell you this machine to make it faster again.""

If this machine is open-source (LN/SegWit is), and if it make it much faster then x8 fatchain, then sure why not. Especially if it is still trustless (it is due to SegWit)."
SegWit only hampers one method of using ASICboost, the least efficient one. The whole ASICboost story is just misleading propaganda.
"I hate to admit it , but stolfi is right here. Segwit does not prevent covert or overt ASICBOOST. Antpool and their partners can still mine 1MB (and occasionally empty blocks) just like before after segwit activates covertly.

Segwit largely nuetralizes ASICboost because:

1)It makes their behavior all the more apparent 

2) It becomes far less profitable because they will only be able to mine up to 1MB blocks and miss out on the fees of miners mining ~2MB blocks with segwit."
Search 'Blockstream patent' if you hate patents so much. Then avoid double standard, or admit to be a liar.
It's a pending patent **application** furchrissakes. Not granted, not used. WTF is wrong with you?
Holy god they used patents to protect their technology! We must stop these evil guys immediately!
Sorry for your stupidity. You have been brainwashed by BSCore. You deserve it.
"The support of BCC from major players shows that segwit2x is not unassailable. BCC will provide the simplest and I think the best next step in bitcoin evolution to the world. We will see what reality has planned after the fork.

My hope is that BCC will let us break from the pattern of taking the lesser evil."
Blockstream gets everything they want and long time users get nothing they wanted, how is that a compromise?
"> Search 'Blockstream patent' if you hate patents so much. Then avoid double standard, or admit to be a liar.

Yeap other of you FUDers tried that yesterday, but the site he shown me admited there are no patents they know of, and they only GUESS there are patents, LOL!

"Actual data shows almost no risk with bigger blocks, data also shows large danger from full blocks.

The thing is, BCC dies bring something which is use. If it can be used and the segregated full chain can't be, that's a lot of stuff it bring to the table, stuff uasf did never have.

That's what your ignoring or missing"
"How is that specification safe from an attack similar to a timewarp?  

Couldn't an attacking miner merely privately post-date a chain of blocks with timestamps each 12h further into the future?  Once they had a sufficiently long chain that tanks difficulty they would extend it to be the longest chain by mining blocks faster than every ten minutes (wall time.). The miner could keep that chain private, then setup poison nodes to only show that chain to victim nodes during bootstrap?  How would a victim differentiate that chain from a legitimate chain that was struggling for miner support?"
">Some old bitcoin starts with the last x weeks of tx reverted.

What would make them think that?

Besides the block number being inferior nothing changes."
Solid argument, so much proof and so compelling
"How would it change?  These dates aren't decided by people.  They're decided by the block height according to the BIP9 spec.

If for some reason the August 8th lock-in is missed (this would require miners to back out of segwit2x), then the next possible lock-in and activation dates would be pushed back to August 22nd/September 5th respectively.

The only way it can activate sooner than August 22nd is if a lot of hashpower is suddenly added to the network making blocks faster than 10 minutes on average.  But even then it would only be sooner by a day or two tops.

So I'm not sure what you're referring to.  Do you understand how BIP9 activation works?  I can explain if not."
To take out Long positions on one and Shorts on the other chain. 
"In my experience, people who unironically use the word ""debunked"" are usually liars, or are really gullible."
"nah, we'll keep whatever we want and get rid of junk like Replace-By-Fee.

you don't get to dictate shit. "
You can have mine for $900 each. Like my ETC sell them fast sell them early. Buy back in if it looks like they might make a comeback like any other altcoin.
How there could transactions reverted? They are different chain?
Why someone should attack it if the hash rate is low? It would slow die without spend money
"> Because Segwit activates August 1st.

Segwit is expected to lock in on August 8th, and activate on August 22nd.  Lot of misinformation here."
"> To avoid the so-called ""opt-in"" Segwit virus.

Segwit is expected to lock in on August 8th, and activate on August 22nd. Lot of misinformation here.  So again I'll ask, why August 1st?  Seems like the entire BitcoinCash altcoin team is pretty ignorant of how the BIP9 activation process works.

> Thanks to Segwit as a soft fork, now we have to hard fork. Great job! 

Segwit doesn't cause a hard fork.  If you're supporting a hard fork, that's on you.  The entire market has come to consensus on Segwit2x.  You're choosing to split off from bitcoin and start an altcoin."
"> It's open source, not a management company

What open source experience do you have? I've been involved in various open source communities long before I ever got into bitcoin. I've never seen an open source community with as much disagreements as I've seen in bitcoin. For instance, the Python community has an thing called the GIL which is pretty contentious, but nowhere near as contentious as the blocksize limit in bitcoin."
"Wishful thinking. It's Core's Segshit code they are running.
"
"Not precisely, users (including exchanges) and miners can run whatever they want. Should both implementations of software on both ends be compatible with each other - then both parties are on same chain.

It doesn't have to be, you as user can convince exchanges to run whatever you want, should your convincing (speech) skills be high enough - you may even go full proof of stake or whatever."
It doesn't matter if 90% of users are running btc1, if 90% of pull requests are going to bitcoin/bitcoin, then Core still wears the pants.
Because those coins have no utility and no one gives a shit.

Yeah, I suppose that's true. Still, it's hardly a surprise that people aren't willing to abandon a unanimous compromise.
"Your 'argument' makes no actual points. Like everyone else responding to this guy in this thread. All you people do is respond with calling him a shill and making vague references to other unrelated situations. If hes worried about patents why should he look at mining hardware in altcoin mining? because they are using patents? what the fuck does that have to do with asicboost being patented and how that effects bitcoin's goals?

You're making the entire sub look bad. congrats."
I don't own the patents , so no ... there are multiple patent owners with a complicated and overlapping ownership that can easily be disputed with AB, so it could get messy , this is why they are mining covertly
"you ""real Bitcoiners"" can have Switcoin.

I want the version of crypto that I signed up for. If all the miners switch to BCC, isn't that a GOOD thing for Switcoin? No more centralization right? 

So it should be in your interest to help promote BCC. Let all the ""dumb"" people move onto the ""scamcoin"". 

If Segwit is superior, you got nothing to worry about. Unless of course you were misled into thinking [segwit](https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179) would take you to the moon. ;)

I understand from this that the adjustment could happen with every block until the the MTP is 12h."
All it take to make most everyone switch is to work while the core chain continues not to work
Segwit isn't bigger blocks. Bigger blocks allows more transactions without prejudice. Segwit only allows more Segwit transactions.
Not really reverted, but that would be how it'd appear to the public. Some old bitcoin starts with the last x weeks of tx reverted.
Don't be a cunt. Provide the source or shut up about it. You're giving us a bad name by engaging in fallacious arguments.
">They would open themselves to legal recourse

If that was true, selling the chips would already be a patent violation; using them would not.

>  exploiting a security vulnerability within bitcoin

Just because someone got it listed as a ""vulnerability"" does not make it so.   That bogus claim only shows the kind of people who support Blockstream.  How can you trust such guys to run your ""bank""?"
"I'm one of the moderates. Not very vocal, but we are probably a greater number than you expect. The extremists are the ones making all the noise.

You'll find I have posted in both r/btc and r/bitcoin in favor of activating the whole Segwit2X deal, not just the first part.

As fa as I'm concerned, SegWit is a good solution on a number of levels, and I can't believe all the FUD that r/btc has kicked up about it. I think it's subconsciously political.

On the other hand, the fear of a bigger base block size in r/bitcoin also seems pretty irrational to me. I don't want to jump straight to 8MB base block size, but I don't see how a modest increase to 2MB will cause the end of the world.

In other words, I think Segwit2X is a perfect compromise for now. It's sad that extremists on both ends aren't willing to compromise at all.

If Bitcoin Cash really forks off at this point, I consider it a big blow to Bitcoin. Yet I also can see that it might end up working out to have two versions of Bitcoin for the two extreme camps to work with. But I still believe the two camps would be stronger together if they could learn to live with the compromise and see each others' point of view. Network effect and all that... the whole is greater than the sum of the parts."

"This doesent make sense. Roger have the power alone to make 2x portion of SegWit2x happen. He can just mine it, create the fork block and then 2x is live. Whats the problem?

"
"No need to sweeten the deal like that, Roger.

SegWit2x will fail as from most bitcoin user's perspective nothing but the activation of BIP141 happened. We didn't sign any deal."
Failure hurts, doesn't it?
Feels like too late. Shift immediately.
"Haha top lol!! :)

It's obvious the crazy fat-blocks is not happening in real Bitcoin, so see you there.

Please keep pumping up bitcoin bucks, I have some more to dump"
"It's a major problem for most of the community who rely on the segwit2x compromise, which should be considered a done deal.
If 2x fails, all transactions they thought were bitcoin between aug1st and november, are actually just a bs-segwit shitcoin?

Wouldn't it have been better to delay Bitcoin Cash until that point? Were currently heading for a lot of forks: far-leaning small blockers with 1mb forever who probably need to split into two with POW change, far leaning big blockers with 8mb cash from august 1st, and the rest on the segwit2x fork. So 3 or 4 forks are pretty much guaranteed this fall.

If a large portion of the community is serious about no-segwit, what miners should have done is issue a warning that segwit funds are not considered real Bitcoins and could potentially be deleted or stolen at a later date, and if segwit2x by some disastrous miracle fails to receive >50% of hashrate, they could have a fallback with bitcoin abc code (post-segwit2x hardfork), that can reduce difficulty, deactivate segwit (rather than steal or delete they should allow transactions out for a limited time, but not in), and increase blocksize to 8mb."
Should have called it Bigcoin, Bitcoin cash is a bad name.
As you won't be needing the bitcoin.com domain in case that happens i'll take it for 1 BCC. As you promise to put all resources towards BCC i will be awaiting my new domain in case the 2X portion fails.
"Title should be: *Bitcoin.com announces plans to reach new low in dishonesty, fraudulently selling altcoins as ""Bitcoin""*"
"> We trust that our fellow community members will also behave with integrity and uphold agreements made

What about the commitment the exchanges made to ""insist that the Bitcoin Unlimited community (**or any other consensus breaking implementation**) build in strong two-way replay protection"".  Don't you think it's reasonable they keep this sensible commitment to their customers and reject Segwit2x?  Shouldn't they behave with honesty and integrity and uphold that agreement?

bahhahhaa, downvote away! I love that you shitblockers are finally hardforking to your own shitcoin."
This sub is so toxic :D
Good luck with that!
Seems like the fallback would make much more sense going to BU instead of the new Bitcoin cash because we use at least tested for many months, Bitcoin cash has been out what for two weeks has it even been vetted?  Also of course you have to add some modification because the chain will now be is segwit chain, so you have to allow for the old segwit addresses to be spent safely will not allow a new ones to be created

Please sell all your BTC for BCC as well and leave our community as you have been very disruptive misleading many over the years. 

Good luck with Bitmain Coin / ASICBoost Coin! "
"BITCOIN IS IMMUTABLE UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT WE DONT LIKE AND WELL START OUR OWN SHITCOIN AND CALL IT BITCOIN BLAH


Looooooool"
Stupid is as Stupid does.
History has repeatedly shown the fickleness and underhand means the BScore camp consistently pulls.  Prepare to waste more time and help BScore out by letting them build momentum and legitimize their artificially crippled bitcoin as you wait for another history lesson to stab you in the back.  There comes a time when you need to stop trying to share a bed with a scorpion and instead go find a new bed.  That time was years ago... However, the next best time is now.

"Roger, you wanted big blocks and you're getting them with BCC (8M). Honestly you should support it now instead of waiting for Segwit2x which is 4x less increase. If your logic works both ways, we can expect you to dump all your BCC if the 2x gets adopted.  
Am I the only one here who feels you're trying to manipulate users who still trust you with this scam?"
Enjoy your life.
"Hey Roger, man. I like the way you think, man but you're not the boss of the miners behind Bitcoin.com. 

Miners will probably do what they think is best and if this ends up a waste of electricity the miners will go somewhere else. 

In general I don't like SW and would rather only have larger blocks. However I think a better plan is in order than simple threat tactics like this title implies. "
I understand you guys *want* bcc to work, but are you really willing to sell all your BTC for BCC?
Bitcoin Cash will die if the BU pools won't provide at least a part of their hashing power to Bitcoin Cash. Waiting for the failure of Segwit2x would be a fatal error. You wouldn't be able to switch then. 
Roger, the BCC chain is almost certain to die in the 90 days until HF activation. It won't exist as a fallback if we don't support it now. This is exactly why the HF is delayed in the first place.
"If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, I will immediately sell all my old Bitcoin.

Update: users don't have many other ways to vote, and nearly all the polls in the past years clearly and explicitly showed that most users wanted the hard fork in 2017 although BSCore spent millions per month to spread lies. Mainly We only can vote with feet. As for me, If we can't  hold both the brand of Bitcoin and the vision of Satoshi together, I would choose to stand with 'vision of Satoshi'. It's Satoshi's vision that I believed would benefit the world from 2011."
"I, like many on reddit, bought into the emotional FUD that is SegWit - I say emotional FUD in that no one is really providing true technical answers in threads. It is all just claiming SegWit is our lord and savior, and anyone who doesn't agree can die. I have repeatedly asked for information to a higher level than just ""its good for cheaper transactions"" and no one can give me answers. I started digging myself after frustrations of not knowing what the fuck was going on. SegWit seems like a creepy church cult where you aren't allowed to question it - just accept and believe in it. I read this article,https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179 and everything kinda clicked for me. Its a shitty fix for a real problem, and people are emotionally invested in it. I'll continue believing that article (which presents both sides of the argument, which is rare for articles these days), unless a segwit believer can present opposing information that makes more sense than just ""trust us its better - we made camo hats to support it!"" -- that being said, I'd love to learn more and truly figure out for myself whats the best course of action - so I ask instead of down voting me that you provide counter arguments preferably with articles and papers, not fud posts. 

Edit: spelling "
"Good choice - honoring the NY agreement that you signed, hence being a reliable and professional business partner and positively distinguishing yourself from Core members, who don't have a problem with ignoring agreements.

Nothing wrong with BCC as a contingency plan."
buying BCC might be the trade of your life time. only thing to do is encourage small blockers to defect from the 2x agreement.
Good
"This will lead to nothing else than prolonging the whole battle once more until (at least) November. Bitcoin (main chain) still being crippled to 1MB, Bitcoin dominance going down further. And Bitcoin Cash as a real solution not gaining enough traction.

At least after this Bitcoin Cash fork nobody has to blame Blockstream or Core any more. Big blockers have the opportunity now, if we're all too anxious to use it, it's our own fault."
"Does that include selling off SegWit coins and buying Bitcoin Cash?

What if it becomes necessary to increase the block size beyond 2MB and that is blocked?"
Well that's good and all, but support for BCC right now makes the 2x hard fork less likely, not more.
"100% fair. 

Bye BlockstreamCore."
"Why do you insist on SegWit? 

Why don't embrace Bitcoin Cash immediately?"
I don't understand Roger.  Won't that be too little, and maybe way too late?  How many times to you need to be bait and switched?
Except for 1 block to cause confusion, the Bitcoin.com mining pool never signalled BIP91 to get it locked-in.
We have the power to solo mine ABC if we need to. 
Boom
Good. If they want to keep fucking around, make them fight for the name Bitcoin. 
Amazing. Please Ver, do it.
 Are you being intentionally dense? I literally can't comprehend how you can think those two things are equivalent. 
"You were just arguing that blockstream doesn't hold any patents. Now you've changed the argument to say, ""well they do, but they promised they won't do anything bad!"""
"> https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge/

""Blockstream offers all of its patents and patent applications under the Defensive Patent License, version 1.1. That means the **technology covered by Blockstream's patents is freely available for use without having to pay a licensing fee or risk litigation**""

so... they are fully against patents (against using patents to attack someone).

I'm waiting therefore for your apology for spreading such FUD, and acknowledging Bitmain are using patents, are are opposite of the anti-government-tyranny. 
"
This is great. If segwit2x activates with a split of segwit2x vs segwit coin, a rational miner would likely choose BCC anyway.
What are the risks involved for your customers?

WE LOVE YOU ROGER!!! please help us and mine only the real satoshi coin.

Lets make bitcoin cash as successfull as bitcoin XT and BU!!!!

Evidence of patent apps can be hidden for years. 
That you continue to being up long debunked things only shows how really ignorant and brainwashed you are
https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge/
"Because a shitty compromise is better than being a negligible minority unsuccessfully trying to make a fork happen.

In real life, a mediocre solution that everyone agrees on/supports/uses is often much better than having two conflicting solutions, even if one of them is better. This is the only reason Bitcoin is still alive, instead of being replaced by one of the many other altcoins that are objectively better than Bitcoin (there are of course many total shitcoins, but also a lot of coins that are simply better). 

Getting serious support for a fork *just after a compromise was reached* is kind of hopeless. If the compromise agreement is broken, there might be a chance again."
"> Why do you insist on SegWit? 

Because it removes **patented asicboost** for example.

Only totall governmental assholes use patents to kill competition.

And doubly so if they also virtual signal and claim they are ancaps and against gov controll. 

yes, like /u/MemoryDealers Roger Ver and his/Jihans Bitmain and asicboost patent.
"
"> if you sign up to an agreement

Who is the ""you"" in this statement? Miners? Genuine question, as I don't understand who this threat from Ver is directed at. "
"And this is why the aug 1 date is really really stupid. They should have planned to activate BCC until after the 2X HF was supposed to happen.

They would have gotten a much higher share of the hashpower, if they waited."
"Of course.

No one is compromising just to keep half a chain. Although for that option to remain on the table, someone has to sacrifice resources to mining BCC in the meantime."
"> BCC - the original and best Bitcoin

If by best you mean using patents to kill competition (asicboost) then sure. 

Fuck free market, Bitmain / Juan needs his money, not some competition.

I hope to when the time and the price is right.

"mempool isn't full.

maxwell's ""fee market"" is unhealthy.

People only talk shit when they need validation that they're on the right ""side"". The market will decide the true Bitcoin. Are you scared because the market is bigger than just r\bitcoin?

Where's the threat? It's simply a statement of intent.
">Am I the only one

 Probably not"
"""Am I the only one...?""


In this thread? Sure fucking seems like it. "
"Because, unfortunately, people like Ver actually keep to their word.

That is something that isn't in the other side's vocabulary.

I trust that Bitcoin.com puts decent enough resources towards BCC though.

51% (BTC) / 49% (BCC) split? :D"
"""I'm in your corner""

Respect to that. You guys will be just like that group of musicians on the Titanic. "
Same thing, that in order to prevent a UASF bitmains choice was to create yet another fork. As opposed to simply supporting one chain. Search for logic won't lead you anywhere.
Yes it will be sad if bitcoin fails due to a bank funded take over and censorship of media, but bitcoin may survive if it can get away from full blocks.
But it's not. Deal with it.
"> Title should be: Bitcoin.com announces plans to reach new low in dishonesty,

Says someone who claims that non-catholicist preachers should be killed."
"Yes, the fork that preserves Bitcoin exactly how it is with the exception of the unlimited block size and scaling Satoshi always intended is the *altcoin*, not the one that introduces radical, untested changes and completely alters the incentive structure and block construction.

Had Bitcoin been forked and SegWit added as its own chain, it would be an altcoin by definition just like the 100s of other projects by devs who had the balls to stand alone with their ideas, unlike you. "
We could of had a debate on this exact issue when you were in Tokyo this month, but you declined my invitation. Blockstream settlement coin is the one stealing the Bitcoin name.
Just go away. 
Luke is correct, If Roger is not careful and dishonestly represents Bit main coin  as Bitcoin on his site he may open himself up to legal problems
You can't be serious. *facepalm*
"Thanks!

Remember, remember! 
    The fifth of November,
The SegWit treason and plot"
take your limited CoreCoin and fork off.
Froggy here doesn't know what immutable means. 
Because other miners have to follow that block or else t is just an orphan block.
*Shhhh*
"> How many times to you need to be bait and switched?

Besides the Hong-Kong agreement what bait and switches are you referring to?

Assuming that's the only example you can think of, here are a couple of differences between HK and the NYA:

* The HK agreement was made between a handful of Blockstream employees/affiliates and some mining pool operators. The Blockstreamers pretended to speak on behalf of Core then flew home and almost immediately told everyone that they hadn't really agreed to anything except writing some token HF code that would never get merged. 

* The NYA was made between the miners - who obviously benefit from bigger blocks, a whole bunch of key bitcoin businesses - many of whom have publicly argued for bigger blocks, and a couple of early bitcoin developers - who have been arguing for increasing the blocksize since before most of us even heard of bitcoin. 

* The HK agreement was worded in a deliberately ambiguous way that allowed the BS devs to never deploy the HF code if they didn't want to (which they obvious didn't).

* The NYA was worded to explicitly require the HF to happen no more than 6 months after the SegWit activation. That timetable has since been shortened to 3 months and the time delayed HF has been deployed alongside the SegWit activation to minimize the risk of any hand wavy bullshit delays."
Yeah, Roger's been trying to manipulate the masses for quite a while, it's likely he'll continue to do it by doing this as well.
What if 2X isn't properly tested and vetted?  If the community is willing to implement untested code that could cause me to lose BTC during a transaction, for example, I would think that would harm people's faith in BTC by quite a bit more.
i didn't sign up for it loser. go back to Mordor
"You are not reading between the lines. Users will be able to point their hash power.

Now who can discern users from providers in a Mining Pool? Again, this is like the Bitmain announcement. Except these guys get to blame it on the users. 😊

Any serious Big Block Miner will point some hashing power to BCC. Don't doubt that. They have little other choice.

If there would be a case for that not to happen, it would just be profitable for the rest of us on our GPUs. Because 2X is very doubtful, especially if no one floods the mempool until than, which would give the best excuse for Core to reject and for Miners to defect without breaking agreements.

The Miners put themselves against the wall, but this time they are actually handling it perfectly."
"Well even if Bitcoin cash produce zero block then chain can restart later if the 2MB got FUDed.

See that as a back up."
It has difficulty adjustment every 6 blocks. If no one mines it, gpu miners can mine. But yeah, I agree, waiting is silly.
No. It could just reboot as needed. BCC2. Maybe BCC should just wait until we hardfork for 2M and then just start mining, accepting and relaying 8+ anyway. 
"yes please roger. after suggesting puting our btc to mt. gox because its safe, you are telling us now to transform our btc for bcc.

I love you, you bastard! When there is an evil of btc, you are his best slave."
Doesn't the BCC chain have a different difficulty adjustment mechanism?
"So then why was August 1st chosen?  It seemed obvious for the last few weeks that the UASF (BIP148) was not going to split the chain.

They should have scheduled the hard fork at the exact block height that the 2x part of Segwit2x was set to activate.  That would have made a lot more sense.

Forking on August 1st is just going to be comical."
"""If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, I will immediately sell all my old Bitcoin.""

I highly doubt that miraculously after 4 years of fighting and no movement Bitcoin will actually get bigger blocks. And, even it blocks do get increased to 2MB, what happens in one year? Are we back to where we are now? More fighting and bickering over which direction to go?

From an investment perspective, Bitcoin has all the signs of a failing company with no roadmap to the future.  

Would you invest in a company who's management has done nothing but sit in a conference room and sling shit at each other for 4 years? That's exactly what Bitcoin has been doing.

I've been an avid Bitcoin supporter/investor since 2012. I pulled out 99% of my Bitcoins and now hold less than 0.5 Bitcoins.

I refuse to invest in something that is progressing the way Bitcoin is.


"
It most likely won't activate. Core and bc are against it. So it's enough for Luke Jr to start uasf2.0 in three months and miners will give up based on some pretend new close door agreements. Just like they did now with giving core, bs and Luke Jr segwit. 
I will gladly trade you 120 'bitcoin cash coin' for actual bitcoin. Straight up. One for one.
This.
What if it isn't properly tested?  You think they should still activate the 2X??
Happy to buy.

"I'm also not very technical on the understanding of all this but lots of the proposals seem like half measures.  BTC needs to stay exactly how it is or it needs to adopt massive change to truly be a better coin.  I think anything in between will spread FUD and maybe not kill BTC but make it stagnant.

If BTC stays the way it is now  I think it simply becomes a store of value.  It raises to 5 or 10k and the market flourishes and other competitors get more use and respect and then we see this peak where BTC makes a long long slow decline because it's competition is not only better but now trusted and actually being used more frequently.
