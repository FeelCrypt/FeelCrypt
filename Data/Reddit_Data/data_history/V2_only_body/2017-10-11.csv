"This started a bit more than a week ago. I've re-submitted the ad for approval three times, and been rejected three times, each time they send me a form response:

>   Reddit does not permit the promotion or advertisement of single securities, other tradeable financial assets, or financial advising.

I've also emailed them and opened support tickets and been ignored. Only out of frustration am I posting this here. It kind of makes me wonder if Reddit isn't in cahoots with the insane /r/bitcoin moderators and that's why they are so tolerant of the propaganda and censorship their site is being used for."
Or perhaps more likely, r/bitcoin reported your ad?
They haven't responded at all to support tickets in over a week?  That's extremely poor customer service, especially since you're completely in the right.  These are not advertisements for any type of security, financial assets, or financial advice.  They're advertisements for a subreddit that discusses Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies.  It's pretty ironic that Reddit accepts Bitcoin as payment for Gold and yet for some reason they don't want there to be ads for subreddits which discuss that.  And, as you point out, Reddit allows plenty of ads which are explicitly asking users to purchase securities.
That is a fucking hilarious statement given the shit I see being 'promoted' across the top of my Reddit page.
"They aren't in cahoots, they are just that stupid, their service is outsourced to some foreign country guaranteed, and the employees have very little training or reading comprehension.  

Best bet, is your ad is already flagged, so they wojn't run it.  Just make a new separate account, and a new ad, so it won't be flagged and will probably go through easy."
are your other ads still going through?
And it's not like this is the only crypto sub to promote itself with Reddit ads anyway. There are a bunch. 
Calling this out now, within half a year of /r/btc surpassing /r/bitcoin /r/btc will get banned for brigading or harassing without proof.
In fairness tho at least they were in talks to remove theymos at one point. The censor was almost on the everyman side for once.

Some of the admins are ok. Or they were a few years ago anyway when I dealt with them a little. Obviously times have changed now though. Bring back Pao,  we made a mistake! #PaoOfWork
Yep, he also edited user's comments in /r/The_Donald, because he was butt hurt they kept calling him a cuckold. Reddit also constantly fucks with the voting system in The_Donald 
">It kind of makes me wonder if Reddit isn't in cahoots with the insane /r/bitcoin moderators

I've had this suspicion for a long time."
"> As well they should.

As well you troll.

-----------------
*Your daily troll tagging info service*."
"So support for Bitcoin Cash, despite it not being accepted (i.e. simply sold off, price under 10% of Bitcoin) by the majority of users outside this sub is fine.  Support for 2x is fine, but support for Bitcoin as we know it isn't fine?  That's trolling?  How is the minority support for BCH not trolling by that logic?

In many ways, when both sides cannot agree on something, either propose another solution or accept the status quo.  That's the part of Bitcoin that's so good, if we can't agree on something, then it doesn't get implemented, it's like a safe fallback.  Other coins can just do as their master pleases, but the real honey badger just carries on."
Some of the admins are big into ethereum so I wouldn't be surprised if they were underhandedly trying to ruin btc
The longer you stare at it, the bigger it gets. Don't focus too much on one tentacle, we need to go for the throat. Widespread cryptocurrency adoption is the stake thru the heart. We are a sovereign planet.
Its wonderful how the sub dedicated to a technology centered around freedom to dissent has become as corrupt as the system it claims it's here to replace.
Yes I would think this is it.
"> they are just that stupid, their service is outsourced to some foreign country guaranteed, and the employees have very little training or reading comprehension.

I've been a moderator of several small communities in the past and always had a reddit admin contact me using perfect English. They were quite helpful in rooting out a few troll spammers who were dodging bans in my sub around a year ago. The service was pretty slow and awful – like 3-month turnaround times on support requests – around 2014. They did a bunch of hiring and beefed up the support system in 2016. Response times are down to 24-48 hours, last I checked. I'm not currently moderating an active sub at the moment, but my experience over the past few years has been that Reddit support has only improved."

"He does great cameos though.

r/btc is more than Bitcoin Cash.
I have a shitty fan theory that this is why Charlie Lee is supporting Core so much.
In some ways I respect Charlie for the community he's built but LTC has done so little different. I hold a small amount but projects like DASH (pay) forked from the Btc codebase too and they have some innovation going on. LTC is like a BTC testnet in production.
"That's my point, his comment:

> r/BTC seems to support both segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash

Was followed up with 

> probably a few segwit1x supporters as well (at least the trolls seem to be).

There are a lot of people split between bitcoin and 2x, labelling bitcoin (current rules) supporters as trolls is just typical of this sub. Objecting to a bunch of companies agreeing a change to bitcoin without support of the main developers and a large part of the community seems perfectly reasonable and in the spirit of bitcoin to me. "
You don't think it's a little premature to start condemning them for something that you have no reason to believe they did?
In a way we are all 1x fans. It's the monster our baby grew to be. Luckily now it's time for change.
"So which ""single security"" do they think you are promoting?

r/BTC seems to support both segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash. There are probably a few segwit1x supporters as well (at least the trolls seem to be).."
Me
As well they should.
"The banner ones (with images) appear to be Google served. The sponsored banners for TokenLot, MonCrypt, Lending Times, and Blockweather are all clear violations of the rule cited for blocking your ad.

I call shenanigans. It never works, but does u/spez have a comment?"
"Reddit supports censorship.

Reddit supports spreading false narratives and lies.

Do not ever think Reddit is on our side. They are not. "
What complete horseshit. 
wtf reddit? ads for your own subreddits are not allowed here? also how's btc a security?

People who hang out in the Bitcoin-related subreddits tend to not stray very far or pay attention to what happens elsewhere on this platform, so they might not be aware that the admins of Reddit are arguably even more vile than the moderators of /r/bitcoin.
This seems like it would be a good candidate for a bitcoin.com news article.  Distribute that over all other social media sites.  Put pressure on reddit.
Boofuckinghoo
Sincerely I find your AD perfect, Target and message very appropriate
"Reddit Ad's is a sack of shit.  I tried using it for something else, paying the $150 extremely high minimum cost, their customer service didn't even understand their own terms and rules, they cites Rule section for denial of ad, then I literally copy and pasted the rule to them, which shows they are wrong.

I am pretty sure its all outsourced to some country with non-native english speaker, because it was like I was talking to a doorknob.  I eventually gave up, and will happy not give them any of my money."
How much does this cost?   Say I wanted to advertise Bacon in /r/islam, or gay porn in /r/christians, for th lulz, how much?  Neither of those are securities based.
/u/spetz Hey I think something may be wrong here.
