I think when all is said and done it will have been the biggest wealth transfer in human history.
It's money like silver is money. It is not its main use today
"Yeah, poor people are too stupid to money, it's for their own good. If you want rights you should have thought about that before being born poor.

"
"That's the ostensible reason for sure, but it does suppress the little guy. This is especially true now that most startups are staying out of the public markets; either they get bought by another company or they don't IPO until the big gains have already happened.

The way to protect the little guy without suppressing would be to allow investment of a percentage of net worth, instead of having a flat $1M cutoff with no limits after that. It makes no sense that someone with $900K can't do these investments at all, but with $1.1M you can invest every dime."
What I was thinking too. 
Yeah those exist, but some of them are prohibitively expensive for small startups to pull off. I'm personally acquainted with a startup that was unable to raise from the non-accredited investors for years. Recently the JOBS Act was finally implemented and they did a $1M raise on a portal, but that's the limit.
No, it’s not a good thing. You can lose 100% of your money playing poker and 100% of your money on investments. 
The elite didn’t get rich by coincidence - that’s for sure.
Um, thank you for making my exact point for me. Since governments are bought off by the rich, then the governments are the problem. This is called crony capitalism. Meanwhile, free market capitalism is the answer. Here’s an image that will help explain to you: https://imgur.com/eN75is2

Wow. I would recommend the website [fee.org](https://www.fee.org) for you... an amazing website with dozens of new articles every week.
Fair money ensures that it will follow the natural law of the Pareto principle. Right now, it's actually much worse than Pareto.
"Fair money?

Yes those who have more will gain more, but the 1% have such an astounding amount more than the next 19% that it's hardly worthy of comparison."
You, personally, are probably in the top 1% of income earners globally, and certainly are in the top 1% of all people historically.  There's always somebody with more than you have, but there are a hell of a lot more people who have less than you.
The top 1%? $205k? Thats two entry/junior level software engineers. It's trivially easy to get to the 1% as a couple in STEM or owning a small business. It's only 1 in 100 people.
"With bitcoin, the wealth will distribute according to the Pareto principle. 

At this time 8 people, have more wealth than 3,500,000,000, that is how degraded the system is. Those 8 people don't produce more value than half the world.

With a fixed money supply when you save the wealth moves from the top to the bottom. With inflation when you save the wealth transfers from the bottom to the top."
"You can't though. If there is a fixed money supply every unit saves is a unit someone spent (the rich have to earn it back from you, they can only spend so much) 

With inflation, if the money supply grows every unit saves becomes proportionately less and less. 

The rich just loan more money into existence. (the rich don't have to earn the money back when you save. They just loan more into existence and diminish the value of your savings through inflation.)  The spending goes on forever, and the suckers are the savers. "
"> owning a house gets you over that hurdle.

No it doesn't. To be an accredited investor in the US you need a networth of $1 million *excluding one's primary residence* or have an income exceeding $200k annually. "

"It doesn't, but people with 500k+ in assets can afford to lose a lot more than those that have less.  Personally I don't support this kind of regulation, but that is the ""reasoning"" behind it."
"The Angles & the Saxons weren't from Britain, so the island has no claim to the language either. ;-)"
If you hold or keep accumulating you help counter that. 
"Wtf! TIL!

This is done to keep weak hands out and protect investors with little liquidity. It is not done to suppress the little guy.
This just isn't true. Reg A+, Reg CF and certain Reg D exemptions allow anyone to invest, not just AI's. And regardless of these exemptions, VCs and Hedge Funds don't raise capital from non-AIs anyway - they just don't have the capital to make it worth their time. 
This is a good thing because it stops small guys making bad decisions with large sums of money. You can lose 1000$ playing poker, but you can lose 10x your money on leveraged investments
Amen!
"Yes. Agreed again. People are stupid when comes to investing. They buying when price is sky high and selling when dumps. 

Human nature. Maybe that's how it is designed? Maybe normal people are not gifted to be rich? 
Fingers crossed for all of us."
Goverments are just tools in rich people toolbox. Sorry to break this to you. They using politics and government for their own benefits. So you wrong pal. 
"I remember my childish libertarian phase too

The issue is and always will be capital and the power structures around it.

Private capital is the true real monster of our age, at least governments still have a frail partial public ownership. "
"No, they don't want to play with little fishes because small investors are more trouble than they're worth, period. I work in securities and speak from experience. And I hardly think requiring a company to provide audited financials and a modicum of accurate disclosure to potential investors constitutes ""burdensome regulation.""  "
With fair money it's more like the 20%.
You were not, are not, and will not, ever be on the same playing field as the top 1%.
You could argue anyone can save money and take wealth from the rich.  Btc is no different.
Thing is if you can afford to loose 100% then they stand to make much higher returns investing in publicly listed small cap stocks that anyone can buy than to have to be a qualified investor and invest in a hedge fund (the majority of which in the long run actually under preform a S&P 500 index fund that's accessible to all).
"Problem is that these days owning a house gets you over that hurdle. Just because you have 500k of assets doesn't suddenly make you a ""sophisticated investor"""
"> When manipulation happens,

I'm talking about how it happens.

New users are fooled into buying IOUs. Since they don't buy real coins, supply of coins doesn't change even though they paid for it. In theory, if no one withdraws, they can sell inifinite amount of bitcoins for $1 each. If you bought coins from somewhere you cannot withdraw from, then you are bamboozled.
"
"You are confliating.

> Manipulate:


> 1: to treat or operate with or as if with the hands or by mechanical means especially in a skillful manner

> 3: to change by artful or unfair means so as to serve one's purpose

We are talking about the second definition here. The one that's not synonymous with affect.

They can *affect* the price all they want, as long as they play by the rules it's not *manipulation*.


"
Like they did with Legacy Bitcoin (LgBTC)
I believe it started already. 
"And here we have a classic troll who tries to bend the meaning of words to ignore the idea behind the words.

We're actually talking about the 3rd meaning, you meta meme fiend."
If you really want to counter that, you need to spend your crypto and get more retailers and business to accept it.  Crypto is only valuable if it's useful, and if everybody is just hoarding it then it's not useful for anything.
That doesn't make any sense. Just keep buying so the price goes up? That's now how it works, or we'd all be rich as fuck. They can cause more selling than buying no matter how many coins you hold.
"> Inflation is a product of a successful economy.

No, it's the product of increasing the money supply that is only made possible by a successful economy. 

Are you saying Bitcoin and all finite supply crypto's are doomed because they have a fixed supply? 

FYI bitcoin's economy has grown. The byproduct of a successful economy with caped monetary inflation is price deflation. 

just look a the cost of a pizza priced in bitcoin.  "
"There is inflation but it diminishes over time. The total number of Bitcoin wont ever exceed 21M. 

Monetary inflation is issued as a block reward that is cut by 50% every 4 years. It started at 50BTC per block and it is now 12.5BTC per block. 

Inflation is subsidizing transaction costs and security while the system bootstraps new users.

The concept of chan splits complicates the idea. Bitcoin BCH and Bitcoin BTC share a common ledger up until August 1, 2017 (it accounts for 80% of all coins to ever be issued.) "
They don't have to force YOU to sell, they can sell, force others to sell. If everyone holds onto their currency and it is never exchanged, it's not a currency. Imagine if everyone stopped spending their dollars. The economy would collapse. 
I've been trying out dex and that's my next one.  How do you like it? Assuming you use it. 
Damn. Nice.  I freaking love that BAT project.  Hope you buy it back some day.

"Kyber is where it is at right now.

They dont add tokens if they dont think it will have volume, the need to add 0x but thats it. If BCH can get on Kyber somehow, then fuck it, its over and Bitcoin (BCH) will have already won. 

Without BCH on Kyber, I don't see it happening. "
"Is there any consistency as to which are the ""top funds""?  It changes year to year, because it's basically just luck.  There is no hedge fund that can consistently outperform a simple index fund over a 10 year period."
"You have a lot of reading to do. there is a whole school of economics that's ignored by the hegemony. 

One place to start is here: https://mises.org/library"
Is BCH trying to get on Kyber?
"No, it can't, thats the problem,

It is a closed system and it is getting better and better every day, BCH is stagnating in this area, and for people that matter, day traders, it is all we care about. "
Forgot kyber runs on 0x which I think is erc20 only. 
it does, really? did not know that, need to read more. thanks. 
0x is definitely only eth compliant but I think it can handle erc20 and is working on erc721 if it can't accept those already. And I think kyber runs on the 0x protocol. 
"Those ""special investments"" are terrible though.  Index funds outperform hedge funds... I really have no idea why anybody buys into a hedge fund, but exclusivity of it definitely isn't a barrier preventing people from moving up in life."
"If any crypto becomes owned by the 1%, people will just start up another one to use amongst themselves.

This problem is self correcting in a way - if the crypto capital becomes owned by a very small minority, people will cease to use it, thus devaluing it. Future cryptos may need to address this by design to protect themselves.

Having alt coins backed by a reserve of bitcoin might be a possible solution. But I think gold would be better for this purpose."
"The rules are rigged. If you are a transnational corporation, you can loan billions into the economy causing inflation, then buy productive assets pre-inflation and profit post inflation. The rules guarantee they make money and your purchasing power is diminished as a result.
"
"> The one percent are not smart enough to do that much better than the other top 19% without cheating, which they can't with fair money.

Having more money to invest, and investing it, by definition means they will make more money if their investment goes up. Having more free time allows them to do more research. I admire the optimism, but the list of reasons this is not accurate goes on and on."
Volume is definitely picking up but there's a long way to go before the largest dex competes with the smallest centralized exchange. Isn't the volume at the top dex something like $10M?
Yes, most poor people have no financial education and lack the discipline needed to be financially successful.  Poor people consistently buy high and sell low. This has been proven. They have no tolerance for volatility and usually have no idea what they are investing in.  
It's expensive because the SEC requires companies to get their shit in order and provide accurate disclosure to potential investors - hardly an unreasonable ask. It's even more important when dealing with non-AIs who are generally less experienced and less capable of absorbing the loss of a bad investment. There's a reason these regulations exist.
Get rich is nothing. Hold to that and be even richer is real challenge. Normally people proving that they cannot be rich if they lived normal life. How many people win lottery and few years later they broke again?....
Good visual. There's creeps at every level. I don't know why people only want to blame the rich. I've known tons of poor that have used the government to take advantage of the system too.
"Is this one of those autistic neoliberal sites?

Sure they have some value, rather how I enjoy The Economist with some well developed articles - but I can’t pretend it’s just not a load of kool-aid."
Not if they have to play by the rules everyone else does. No special investments for only the rich and congress, because the block chain is transparent. No favouritism. The one percent are not smart enough to do that much better than the other top 19% without cheating, which they can't with fair money.
The top 1% as in the top wealthy individuals, not in terms of salary.

Inflation is a product of a successful economy. You can't have a currency that's being spent successfully and not have inflation. It's a product of investments. More spending = more buyers = prices go up.
"The reasoning was done back in the day when 500k was a lot of money. It still is kind of, but 20k for a house was probably the amount when the law was enacted, so it really should be something like 12.5m today.

It's probably a good amount before someone is allowed to play with the real sharks of this world."
"> You were not, are not, and will not, ever be on the same playing field as the top 1%.

Physician heal thyself.  You have a victim's mentality.  The reason you can not compete with the ""1%"" is because of your attitude.   The 1% is very fluid and most are in it for a short time.  If you are talking about the World 1%, then most in the US are the world's 1%.  If you are talking about the history of human beings, most of everybody living today is in history's 1%.

>  Just keep buying so the price goes up? 

You see the world as being binary.  That wealth is static and those that wealth have it at the expense of others.  Why do you have to keep buying? 

> They can cause more selling than buying no matter how many coins you hold.

How can they force you to sell?  Do people not have a choice in the transactions?  Some coins are limited in number and can prevent inflation.  Inflation is what fiat currencies suffer from and this is one of the reasons for the creation of cryptocurrencies.  Inflation is what those in power want.  That has been one of the largest wealth transfers.

"Kyber is the best! 

I day trade and use it constantly. BCH needs a kyber if we want to stay relavent. Traders like me are moving 100% to ETH just because I can trade it easily, while BCH still needs a stand alone wallet app (ETH has Meta Mask) and the need for a centralized exchange. 

I am this close to selling it all for ETH but Bitcoin is my first love and I will always hold some just for fun/. "
"I was going to agree with the “biggest transfer of wealth” statement until it went to claiming wealth flowing to poorer people. 

They just passed a trillion-dollars-over-10-years tax cut that almost entirely benefits the rich, and they’ll use it as a pretext for cutting services and raising safety net that everyone paid into. 

Bitcoin is small potatoes next to that. 

How many people are getting rich with bitcoin? And how does it compare with striking gold or oil during various historical rushes? I’d guess early oil rushes are the biggest source of poor people getting rich, though I suppose it wasn’t so much a wealth transfer then. "

"Some teach this guy Economics 101. Since 2008, a large share of retirement funds across the United States have majority equity in their portfolio with hedge funds and VC funds also featuring prominently in this. Watch [this](https://www.realvision.com/rv/television/videos/6f2523e435aa4513b69447b11803e323) 48 min discussion regarding the coming retirement crisis before talking about how this will be greatest transfer of wealth to crypto-assets. 

Don't get me wrong, crypto-assets will be one of the biggest safe havens in the next 2 years of near continuous decline in the stock market as people start taking out their retirement savings or what little they have left of them since 2008 burnt most of them quite badly. Expect the Fed's policy to basically mirror BOJ policy of the last decade of buying up more of the stock market to keep the market buoyant as it continues to collpase and take on ever larger amounts of debt which the US govt cannot finance.

To delude yourself that this will be greatest wealth transfer ever is to ignore the fact that millions of old people will be living off McDonalds in trailer parks and a greater propensity to elect populist leaders. Donald Trump is the symptom of all future presidents in the near term. "

"Anyone can invest in a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund (including leveraged ETFs).

Hedge funds are for accredited investors. 

To most people this distinction really doesn't much mater and those ETFs usually out preform hedge funds anyhow. The only area where needing to be an accredited investor is a real distinction for the average person is that only accredited investors can purchases private equity. However in all likelihood if such laws didn't exist private equity wouldn't be sold the the average person anyhow because if they wanted to they'd just go public in the first place."
"Restrictions on what constitutes an ""accredited investor"" keeps many out"

They are perfectly legal to get into... you just need the capital first. Or you know, invest in a 401k or 403b which are forms of these. 
What if the wealthy never buy in? Then, how will the wealth transfer happen? Will the middle and lower classes create their own economy in which we only do business with each other and only pay each other in crypto? God, I hope so.
"You can invest in most assets with even a small amount of money.  
  
Larger exclusive funds are restricted by the government because they're risky (protecting you from yourself) and because your 5k investment isn't worth the cost of account management to a boutique fund.  
  
Crypto is the wild west and there are no rules, so yeah, anyone can buy it. But it's either a commodity or a currency: if it's a commodity then it's price is only driven by demand. If it's a currency it's price is driven by (perceived) utility. It is not an investment asset, no matter how sophisticated your trading software and your technical fundamental analysis make you think it's a real thing. bitcoin has one price driver: whether people think it will be useful in the future. It doesn't generate value and it has a mathematically defined deflation rate.  
  
Once someone develops a platform for e-commerce that makes all coins equivalent so that you can purchase anything with any coin then the coin with the lowest energy cost to run the block chain will be the only one worth using, and the absolute limit of how useful it will be will depend solely on its energy cost.  
  
At present MasterCard and visa can charge 0.5% on transactions so let's assume that's the floor. If a cryptocurrency blockchain can be more efficient than that it's value will appreciate, otherwise it's just a hobby for shills and speculators.  
  
The technology itself is cool and is a useful way to run order books, but that isn't bitcoin or any other coin.

This definitely answers the question as the boomers tend to have a dinosaur mentality in relation to technology."
"How much BCH do you need to be the 1% if all money would be replaced by BCH?

Edit: just for fun I did this: 21.000.000/7.000.000.000 as we're trying to divide the 21 million coins to 7 billion people? With an equal distribution everyone would have 0,003. So if you have at least that much then that means someone will have less than you. Now consider the wallets with hundreds of thousands of BCH.

And all of this isn't even accounting for the lost coins."
"You are absolutely right. There are too many unqualified people giving financial advice based on their previous luck with gambling. Too many people see it as an investment without considering the utility. 

I’ve seen far too many college aged people believing they are oracles in this space."
As if people who aren't accredited investors would make good investment decisions lol.  You need to price yourself on the public markets before playing with the big boys - it's to protect normal people from getting scammed out of money, not a secret club for everyone that has a liquid million.
Exactly. Unfortunately, most people are too stupid to invest responsibly (see: ICOs), and those people are the same ones who demand regulation to protect them from themselves.  *sigh*
"> If the general public was investing in hedge funds there would be cries to the government about how money managers are swindling little guys. People would be screaming for regulation, including most of you, because you would be losing money as well.

Bitcoin is pretty fungible and increasingly so.
What, is this r/CryptoCurrency now? #bullishaf #thisgonnabeHUGE #positivesentiment #hedgefundsarecoming
Same as poloniex and their version of tether.
[https://funfair.io/](https://funfair.io/)
Anyone can buy stock in public companies, but in the U.S. you need to be an accredited investor to invest in hedge funds, VC funds, and most startups. To qualify you need at least a million dollars in liquid net worth, or over $200K annual income for the past two years.
When did they make investing with hedge funds illegal? Anyone can grow money in the stock market it is not just for shadowy cabals.
"The difference is with Bitcoin people who save can erode the wealth of the 1%. 

Today, fiat is inflating at 3% if you save inflation diminishes your savings. The result of inflation is wealth continues to accumulate in the hands of the 1% who get the new money first. 

Those last to earn it pay the inflation tax and then they pay again when they try and save.

The bitcoin rich get only a 1 time advantage where the 1% in fiat are perpetually advantaged."
Yeah, not really. Look what is happening already... We've got professional players in the game now. They manipulate and suppress prices and everyday Joe is selling out low after having bought high, while the manipulators control the markets and create the situations to buy low and sell high. That centralizes wealth. 
"rich people that have at least half a brain will realize you better get on this train or get run over

rich people that rule through fear, ignorance and stupidity will get run over like the rest of them because they will all **definitely** fight the inevitable

in other words, the way it should be."
The chosen few are rich people that can afford to lose 100% of their investment in hotfund2018. You have to register as a qualified investor which takes like 500k in assets. It keeps people from scamming the little guys. Unlike bitconnect etc..............................
The point is that you don't want to invest in them.  They are a scam.  That's why the government bans them, unless you're super rich then they let you throw your money away.  In principle, that double standard is offensive, but in practice you're not missing out on anything.
"What do you mean by choosen few, you mean an accredited investor?

It is not hard to become one, just try Google if you want to try it (also you need to be rich). "
This statement neglects all the legal funds the average Joe can invest in such as ETFs, mutual funds, oh and basically any stock listed on the NASDAQ, NYSE, BATs, or even those start ups on OTCMArkets.
Americans , shit - people in general seem to love to be ruled over and told what they can and can’t do.  People don’t need to be free - they only need to be happy.  Happiness is defined for them through marketing and propaganda. Few people have the ability to connect the dots as Bruce succinctly did in this tweet - they only need food, NFL, and prime time tv to be happy.  
Why do people believe the greatest wealth transfer in history will be into an asset which lacks fungibility?
Security in the form of a bad ass military and more angry cops in each town than then there are leaves on its trees!  Hell yah!!!
Like the imaginary fiat which is perpetually created by banks and backed by your government masters!?  Lmfao!  You sound like a smart fellow mind if I follow you!?  
What? When manipulation happens, it also affects the value of your coins. Regardless of where they are. Or am I misunderstanding your post? 
They'll just make it worthless.
"Do you people think Hedge Funds outperform the market? 

I guarantee ""crypto redditors"" would do worse picking funds than flipping a coin on stocks. Tossing money at a speculative instrument in a single speculative asset class does not make you a sophisticated investor. 

If the general public was investing in hedge funds there would be cries to the government about how money managers are swindling little guys. People would be screaming for regulation, including most of you, because you would be losing money as well. 

You may think such idiots should be free to flush their money down the drain (as am I), but the reality is that people would refuse to blame themselves and welcome regulation as ""payback"". "
True.  Would be nice to see more volume head that way.  
But now it's an even playing field in terms of accessibility. Sure the 1% have a huge head start with capital but if they don't produce something useful they won't make money. It won't be like today where they have an unfair advantage with bail outs and inflation. That is what I am hoping at least.
Get in while you can. That party will not last.  Of the possible future regulations, KYC will probably come out first, at least for ICOs with US exchanges following right behind. 
"It's a different 1% than the previous 1% at least.

Wealth also tends to flow to the most educated in society, so it is a bit of a choice as to who belongs to the 1%."
"> you just need the capital first.

This is what he is talking about.  The legal limitations placed on those instruments."
Land of the free my arse. I think that sentence only makes sense in British English. It means America is far from being the land of the free.
"> Look at the distribution of btc by total wealth per person.

That's the thing about Bitcoin. You can't. Analyzing the addresses doesn't provide any clear picture. Many big addresses belong to exchanges in which the funds represent multiple users, some big addresses are lost coins from the early days. Additionally many users have their coins stored in multiple addresses so there may be people out there more wealthy with small amounts in several addresses than big amounts in one.

We really have no idea what the actual wealth allocation is of Bitcoin. "
It will just shift from a few wealthy fiat-rich people to a few crypto-rich people. But that’s how markets work. The public has the opportunity to buy crypto now, but most are too skeptical 
Absolutely the 1% will gain even more than most, as always.
"This just misunderstands how percentages work in income taxes and how the tax reform package worked. If rich people pay most of the taxes because of progressive taxation and you give all brackets about the same cut then most of the benefits will accrue to the rich because they get taxed at higher rates in the first place. It doesn't then follow that the tax cuts benefited the rich at the expense of tax cuts for the poor. 

Made up numbers but to illustrate my point:
A 3 percent cut to someone who is taxed at 15% of 65K a year salary is gunna be less nominal dollars than a 3 percent cut to someone who is taxed at 30% of a 300K a year. That doesn't even cover the cuts to business taxes which will accrue to the rich, BECAUSE THEY OWN THE BUSINESSES. But obviously it helps anyone who works for said businesses or buys their products. 

Now no doubt congress is terrible and spending way too much, see the omnibus and the recent annihilation of the Penny - Budget Plan. But that is a spending problem not a taxation problem. "

because the regulations make it burdensome to allow these investors to participate.  The costs placed upon the VC's an Hedge Funds to be in compliance with regulations stop them from playing with the little fishes."
