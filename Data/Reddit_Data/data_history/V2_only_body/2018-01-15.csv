based on what it is....?
"people have been calling out the fake news since it began in mid December.  The fact the ""news"" of the ""ban"" kept breaking by repeatedly going viral harder than previous time with new publications mentioning it was frustrating and painful to watch.  I thought it was confirmed not getting banned before Christmas, but that last time it went super viral actually had me convinced it might actually be happening.  Probably the direct quotes and whatnot.  People need to stop taking too seriously what any individual says about coming government action if the individual does not single handedly have the authority to make it happen.  The news story in situations like this should read [Name], the [position] of [institution] says the government of [nation] is going to [whatever] but it's the <specify> that ultimately decides this and they have [not yet commented / confirmed / denied] that they are going to take this course of action.

...but sensationalist headlines get clicks, clicks generate ad revenue, and bad news is more profitable than boring news.

This is probably why China has ""banned"" crypto so many times.  I do not think that the amount of traffic these stories get or the corresponding ad revenue is trivial.  Bad news of something that will affect many potential readers will reach a massive audience, and that exposure is agnostic to whether it's truth, exaggeration, or complete fiction."
"Right, but this is just obvious market manipulation by corrupt officials.

It's akin to trump saying he would ban crypto, buying the dip, then come out and endorse crypto.

Which actually sounds like exactly something in store for 2018."
We did :) 
Like a whole week ago lol
Before they make it Legal, you mean? If they make it illegal said minister wont be able to sell, right? :)

"Regulation is bad

(Edit) The reason I say it's bad is because:

Cryptos are full of a lot of irrational investors. This has attracted traders that are capitalizing on this. Because irrational investors are trading off news and emotion, volatility can be wild. Traders are capitalizing on this behaviour, and in doing so I believe are preventing massive losses by buying up crypto when some news story (such as this news last week) breaks.

Regulation is what these traders are most worried about, not news stories. Regulation means it may be harder for them to implement their strategies. I don't think regulation will stop irrational investors from being irrational but it may hamper other traders. 

Sorry I didn't explain my reductionist opinion in full earlier,  I didn't have access to a PC."
"DEX

Problem is how to solve fiat-crypto swap"
Source?
"It's considerably better than a blanket ban. 

Crypto will see a ton of pushback. It does things that will seriously hurt banks even in the relatively short term, and pulverize them long term. 

For instance, remittances. Some poor overworked house slave in America wants to send some money back to her birth country to help the remaining family there and winds up paying 20% in fees and waiting a week. 

Crypto? Send for under a cent and it's there in seconds with BCH. The only hard part is finding someone to buy the BCH for fiat at the destination. But with enough adoption, people can trade crypto for crypto in retail also, which means banks are no longer useful for anything. 

The banks currently for all intents and purposes own all the politicians. They'll start making serious noise when they realize the FUD campaign of ""oh Bitcoin is a bubble it's going to crash don't say you weren't warned"" don't work."
"It is good news. Once you buy a crypto you have many ways to keep your privacy if you want. The key thing is leaving the fiat world behind you.

It is like physical cash, right? Your bank knows how much you withdrew, but spending it is anonymous. You can have this anonymity back with crypto.

"
Sorry I meant making market manipulation illegal, not Bitcoin illegal. Once they drop the price enough and buy in they don't need to manipulate the market anymore.
Yeah i should ðŸ˜‚
"You should read ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair "
simple, reductionist opinions about very complicated things are bad
[deleted]
Yes, that is totally true. Though, once you buy crypto you'll be on a list and identifiable. But yes, if more people continue to use crypto then they won't be able to do much since majority of the population will support crypto.
Yeah. Well, market manipulation is a very vague thing and very difficult to catch. This means that there will be some arbitrary shit going on, which is not good.
"The good thing is that the government cannot seize your crypto, but they can always seize your fiat money.

I have a sort of ""out of the box"" thinking in regards to the regulations. Let them regulate, let them make the average joe feel safe and let the government track their ""terrorists"", I don't care. At the end of the day, this is the seed that will germinate in the replacement of fiat money. We play the rules to make them fall apart later on. 

The transition will occur in this way, there is no other better way, because if they crackdown everything, people won't be able to put part of their fiat in crypto. So let them regulate. Smart countries are opening their arms to crypto, like Japan, there is no turning back now and if one country squeezes people, they will eventually move out."

Well it looks like they can start at the ministry that floated the idea of a ban.  Maybe someone there was shorting last week."
why ban something you can regulate to death?
"Im sure it will be ""banned"" again next week when another minister decided he needs to buy in cheap.

"Are they banning not using crypto or banning the use of crypto? Wouldn't ""CRYPTO BAN"" make more sense, if they are trying to forbid it?"
"I totally agree.

The thing is, I feel that they (rich people[the bankers], especially Rothschild, they somewhat control the Banks and have done a lot of crazy shit) are finding a way to make crypto fail. The reason is that if Crypto succeeds, the Banksters won't be able to create inflation, print more money to make themselves richer, loan to others on interest and fund wars."
this is misleading news story -they are still having discussions- don't bet on it yet
may be its make some postitive results in crypto market.
"Ban or overly regulated....same result....90% will try to cash out without consequences while they can. The rest will try to stock up and hope for a better future.

2018 is when countries roll in all sorts of regulations. We have 6 months or less to play with the current rules. 12-18 months to make money off of ICOs. "

"**Ad hominem**

Ad hominem (Latin for ""to the man"" or ""to the person""), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

However, its original meaning was an argument ""calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason"".

Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.

The study is fine, the hype from people citing it is what's off. All the paper says is we can expand block size 1.7x without harming the network.
"The ""centralization"" argument relies on a misunderstanding of both what decentralization means and how Bitcoin was designed. "
I have no idea what small blockers are even talking about. You can go on Amazon right now and buy a 12TB HDD for $300. All you need is fast web access. If you wanna be a hobbyist and run a full node then you can. Same as other hobbyists have their own telescopes, or music recording studios, or fucking model rail sets for all I care. It's a few hundred bucks of investment to get the appropriate equipment. Bitcoin is popular! There are thousands of miners and hobbyists willing to do this. Decentralization! But oh no we all have to spend hundreds of dollars on transaction fees even if we don't want to run a full node because of their warped notion of muh decentralization.
"Its not published in a journal that does peer-reviews. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03998.pdf

 The conclusion are: 

> Our observations show that Bitcoin has a higher capacity network than Ethereum, but with more clustered nodes likely in datacenters.

> Further, we see that Bitcoin has undergone tremendous growth and can increase the block size by a factor of 1.7x without any decrease in decentralization compared to 2016.

>Finally, Ethereum has a lower mining power utilization than Bitcoin, likely due to the high block frequency [and] we see that Ethereum
would likely benefit from a relay network to increase its mining power utilization.


"
"The paper itself is posted to arXiv, which is not a peer reviewed journal. Reading the article itself, the authors write ""The authors thank Vitalik Buterin and the anonymous reviewers for their feed-back on earlier drafts of this manuscript.""

The imprimatur that peer review offers is that you have to convince people not affiliated with your work to publish your work (with some journals being more picky/prestigious than others). It's an accepted conference paper, which is worth something, but peers never had a veto so I think it's misleading to call it peer reviewed."
Well it sure doesn't state the opposite. The conclusion refutes everything BSCore has been preaching.

Sirer is the man! 
"They honestly seem to bounce between storage space, network transmission rates for masternodes and miners with no particular focus....

Meanwhile a number of blockstream related companies now appear to profit from reduced block size : e.g bitfury can now track your transactions. 

I don't think they are doing some genius level analysis that /r/btc cannot understand. I think they are simply doing it for the money. "
"This headline is misleading.

First, this is a submitted paper for a conference, ~~it's not peer reviewed.~~ *edit: there is some debate about this; at the very least, the paper it's accepted for a conference and will be peer reviewed, if it has not been already.*

Second, the actual conclusion of the paper is:

> Further, we see that Bitcoin has undergone tremendous growth and can in-
crease the block size by a factor of 1.7x without any decrease in decentralization compared to 2016. 

The paper does not opine on whether or not block size increase provides a feasible long term solution for transaction volume scaling."
So no change since that debate took place in 2012. We are way past this anyway now
The study misses the point, the debate is subjective. We can have 1GB blocks, the question is at what point is the centralisation caused by bigger blocks is 'too much'. Some developer make a compelling case 1MB is too much. I diagree, but this study is way off the mark. It's like trying to mathematically calculate whether a painting is beautiful.

Fees are way cheaper on BCH. I have to send ZEC somewhere to flip for a supported coin on GDAX and all exchanges ask for like 0.01 LTC or more to withdraw. With BCH it's 1/10th of that.
That is good but don't forget that the succees of a crypto does not depend on how many people speculate with it, it depends on how many participate. So don't forget to participate. Buy and sell with Bitcoin Cash as much as you can.

I waited until it was $7000. But you're right - I should have sold it at $4000 and then used the profits to buy more BCH because that was about the best time to switch. The early adopters of BCH did the best.

Considering that Coinbase/GDAX is what? 9th on volume for BCH...doubt it will affect much 
Awesome! Hopefully, they'll do the same for BTG, BCD and all the shitcoin forks so we can cash in for more of that sweet sweet BTC.

"Takes a while before everybody realized that with buying Bitcoin they bought hot air. Without utility Bitcoin itself is useless. Utility means usage and for usage you need users. Bitcoin core is doing a wonderfull job at getting angry at their own users. They say: you are using it wrong. But no, they corrupted what was build right. Bitcoin Cash is no corrupted and because it is Bitcoin it also has the network effect. And it has the hash power (20%) which means that all other crypto can be attacked easier then Bitcoin Cash because it's hash power is massive compared to the other crypto. Using a different algo means that more people can mine if very easy it also means that the goverment just needs to confiscate enough GPU's that have already been build to attack those coins that use a differernt algo. But the process of designing a ASIC chip is not very easy and you need the righ equipment. That equipment is primarily in China. This makes it very hard for western powers to attack it. Therefore they have bet on undermining Bitcoin by trying to turn it in to banks 2.0. But they failed as this community is proving every day a little more then the day before.

People load bots with money and let them do their thing. 
What are you trying to say? I can't tell
I think we can both be right about this
"I'm trying to say: stop trying to twist every interaction into the *us vs. them* nonsense. There's no such thing as a ""bitcoin person"" or a ""bitcoin cash person"" in the context of a rivalry between the two, and *if you identify as one in opposition to the other, you're a tool* which brings me to my next point which is why the fuck do people feel it necessary to insult each other while they're essentially having a conversation about fucking economics of all things. Calm down, y'all. This is not the sort of thing that is supposed to be exciting, or in need of a crusade for justice."
My entire point here is that this petty tribalism is pointless.

"Did The Dao seem solid to you? What do you think about the Parity massive loss of funds?  Complex systems break more easily.

As for the OP, congrats on ETH being the current transaction champ but BCH is gunning for the same spot and momentum is building.

It should be an interesting 6 months!


"
Not as an ecosystem, I am not suggesting Doge should be more valuable than Ethereum, that is silly.  I was responding to your notion that the speed of transactions mattered.  Without RBF zero conf is fine for 99% of use cases which is how payment processor like bitpay can offer immediate settlement.

Gas price being the same, why would a higher gas limit be worse?
"That'll change if BCH utility and price increases, while Bitcoins simultaneously decreases. It needs to completely separate from tracking Bitcoins ups and downs to help with that too.

If Bitcoin continues to do well and grow and remain a long term challenger to BCH, that might become more of a problem, but the longer it remains slow and expensive, the more likely adoption will shift.
"
But we all know what happened after Gavin gave up control.

Oh, indeed. In that case, apologies. Didn't mean anything by it.
"No, but I think this statistic is remarkable and deserves to be shared with the larger crypto community. Currently Ethereum processes far more transactions than all other decentralized blockchains combined, as well as more value in those transactions. Those are pretty astounding and irrefutable metrics.

And I have not performed any vote manipulation whatsoever. What makes you assume as such?"
Dash can already scale to 400mb blocks every 2.5 minutes through the master node network and are working on parallelised hardware for much higher throughput.  Bitcoin cash was happily processing 8mb blocks  during a stress test yesterday.  This is a philosophical argument about decentralisation more than a tech argument about throughput.
Yes, that's what I thought too, and the reason why I was more confident in BCH than ETH to assume BTC role. But seing ETH recent performance I'm starting to doubt.

Well, he's right (though some context would have been more prudent, hence [my answer to his tweet](https://twitter.com/antiprosynth/status/948912256900849664)). Ask him whether the same is true for Bitcoin and he will most likely be far more critical even. Crypto is still in its infancy. The difference is in admitting that and actively working on solving the challenges presented versus defending the status quo in hubris. Why do you think he is one of the lead researchers for Ethereum?

CNBC's Dumb Money in particular has been bafflingly stupid.
"How was The DAO not audited enough as hundreds if not thousands of developers reviewed its code before millions were lost until ETH forked to steal them back? (after all the funds not taken as a hack as technically followed the rules of the contract, so ETH did steal then back and so much for immutability)

How was Parity, a company created by a co-founder of ETH, not able to write a wallet that didn't have its user's funds go into a black hole as a result of a teenager playing around with its public interface?

I guess you'll need some top notch auditors for every single contract, lol.

I think ETH is an interesting science project that will likely have continued failures losing its naive users additional millions.

Now that we've traded insults, maybe it's time to let this thread die after your last response."
People don't have to scroll through much of your history to see you're a shill. As for the upvotes on this thread and downvoting of the people that is calling you out on your bullshit, that'll be a bit harder. But why don't you keep your vote manipulation to the cesspool called r/ethtrader instead? What are you trying to achieve? Or are you so dumb that you actually think this thread will affect the price of Ethereum in any way whatsoever?
"You are conflating unaudited smart contracts with flaws in the protocol. They are completely separate though.

Those dirtiest miners are just moving their enterprise abroad. PoW mining will always suffer from locality and thus also local influence.

"On the all time chart it shows avg transaction fee is 4. On the 3 month chart it shows about 2.

I live on a 3rd world country and 0.20 is nothing at all.
Is Monero not included due to privacy problems? Lmao. 
so ethereum is the real bitcoin?
In what sense is bitcoin more private by default?
Thanks
I see. This only applies to the edge cases, though. Unless miners are doing the whole sorting like you say, then it would be more meaningful.
"I probably will position myself in ETH.

But I confess I'd rather see BCH succeeding, mainly due to the ideological background behind this community. People here are much more committed to sound economics and liberty principles. The Ethereum community is not that much. And the technical advantages of Ethereum could eventually be ported to BCH.

Anyways. ETH is definitely better than BTC, no doubt about that."
Standard transaction fee is $.173 [Source](https://ethgasstation.info/)
will that same person you described have a cell-phone with a data plan, or a computer with internet connectivity...?
I stated where I get it from. Eth gas station website.
How many of these are actual commerce and not just token-to-token trading? We knew altcoins are hot recently, and many of them are on Ethereum or trade through it, but that use case doesn't really compete with either of the Bitcoins. 
Are those fees for a simple transfer or smart contract usage?  The more computations, the more the transaction costs so you may be trying to compare apples to oranges.  For a simple transaction that is similar to bitcoin, cost has been less than a dollar.

Both Ethereum and Bitcoin could have a single opcode dedicated to sending a given amount between addresses.
"Because miners don't know what's the actual gas use of a transaction before running it. Which means that a transaction has zero chance of getting included if a block they are forming is getting close to the gas limit so that the limit won't fit, but the actual use would.  

I currently don't know how the block forming algorithm works in detail, but logically it makes sense to first sort transactions by gas price and then within each bucket by gas limit. So instead of having a chance of getting included equal to other transfers with the correct limit and the same gas price, his transactions can only be included after all transactions with the smaller limit get in.

Buy both. It doesn't matter if ETH does well, Bitcoin Cash is also going to do well. They're both coins with high utility and high potential.

Gas is not the same as tx fees. Different designs. Not directly comparable. 
I'm not sure. But from the time I originally posted that the recommended gwei went from 20 to 7. 
"In Bitcoin, assuming you are using a decent wallet software, you end up with one ore more different addresses each time you transact, which makes it relatively difficult for an outsider to track your transactions. Wallets also can (or at least should) select outputs smartly in order to increase privacy.

Since every Bitcoin transaction is separate and has to be signed in order to be spent, using a different address to receive each transaction and using a change address (that is different than ones used in the input transactions) does not change the cost of using the system at all. So it is a natural default for all users, which I think is very important.

I am not an expert, but AFAICT trying to emulate this for Ethereum accounts would be a mess. In turn, more advanced privacy features will be possible there, but I am guessing it is going to be much more costly than the simple transaction.
"
Actually, not complicated at all. The first phase of Casper will just be a set of smart contracts. It's incredibly elegant in many ways.
"Yeah, they are def on the forefront of low quality reporting. It creates the perfect tsunami for the average investor, who feels his opinion validated, because it is on TV.

Very interesting, but also quite disturbing to see all this unfolding."
I'm a troll now? Lmao
Well, that's not entirely accurate. On-chain there is Casper and Sharding. Off-chain there is Plasma, Raiden, MicroRaiden, and other variations of generalized state channels.
That is literally what I said. 
"Yep. 

I make my buying decisions on the underlying technology, and I'm super interesting in the new proof of stake stuff.

Which part is inaccurate?
BTC has a 21 million coin limit. ETH coin production will decrease exponentially but it is technically unlimited.
Think they only count fully decentralized ones. That's why Ripple, PayPal and Visa aren't included either...
I advise you to do the math. You'll see where you went wrong.
Got some proof? You're the only one i see being heavily downvoted, and frankly most of your posts deserve the 'valuation' they're getting.
"Yeah, I can confirm this guy is a ETH-shill. Both /u/antiprosynthesis and /u/BeerBellyFatAss (who is the top upvoted comment) are.  If you look up their history they spend most of their time on r/ethtrader. Oh, and by the way, this is coming from someone who has been looking into Ethereum since late 2015. So wouldn't surprise me if they have done vote manipulation.

I won't go in to a ETH vs BCH discussion, but Ethereum has more attack vectors and 70% of ethereum being sold at the ICO etc. They just have different usecases. "
"> Nobody knows how much Ether is there going to be at the end - that's the only thing we know about further Ether supply 

Well, a part of of that is up to Chairman Vitalik and his dev buddies to decide at the next fork, and no amount of upvote bots will change that. :)

To each their own :)
In their defense, it takes some knowledge and experience to be able to evaluate the fundamentals in crypto. And with projects like Cardano, Ripple, Tron, ... targeting their marketing specifically at those without that knowledge and experience, that price movement is understandable. Unfortunately it's also those people that will suffer the most when the inevitable blood letting happens and they find themselves stuck in the AOL/Myspace/Pets.com rather than the Google/Amazon/eBay of crypto. It doesn't help that a lot of the new, dumb money sloshing around in crypto also happens to suffer from extreme Dunning-Kruger effect.
This is truly astonishing. How are these people reading about cryptocurrencies (multiple times a day) on reddit not aware of very basic stuff about the biggest coins in the scene?

The line chart shows ETH shooting above BTC on the far right, and by a margin that looks like more than the rest put together. What am I missing here?
Hard to say, but I'm sure some of it is. A valid use case either way.
I was noting why Monero wasn't included, not making assertions as to how many transactions per hour are made on its network.
That is my whole point, and I found it amusing. 
The OP is simply a shill who never posts in this sub other than to promote ethereum, and every time there is obvious and blatant vote manipulation in the threads. This is nothing to do with ethereum or btc just OP being a shill and manipulating  votes.

Fees are a bit higher (currently less than a dollar for a very fast transaction, see https://ethgasstation.info). Performance is about the same. Nobody is claiming that Ethereum magically solves all scalability challenges today. It has the strong lowest layer and the developer mindshare to do so though.

"Lol @ mechmarket. This is awesome!

Maybe because we canâ€™t tell how much is being transferred?
Only transaction count is known. Monero processes around 0.5% of Ethereum's transactions. So I think it's safe to say that the transacted USD value won't exceed 1% of Ethereum. That means that it would not or barely be visible on this chart anyway. See www.bitinfocharts.com.

Could you elaborate on the lack of hard limit?
Will POS really help with scaling or is that a piece required to get sharding working?
Transaction fees and throughput are a function of the amount of transactions being processed. Naming blockchains that have about 0.5-1% of Ethereum's transaction count is therefore completely pointless.
This is an argument you cant ever win, man. Are you really trying to compare Dash and Doge to Ethereum? Rootstock? Lol...
There are no unknowns in the Casper PoS design.
"Have you listened to Vitalik's recent comments about the differences in vulnerability? 

On the ""Unchained"" podcast, he made the point - which made sense to me - that if someone can control 51% of hashpower, then they can kill any POW crypto by periodically broadcasting a longer valid chain and wiping out all of the blocks that were produced by the 49% - and they can keep doing this indefinitely until the 49% have to fork and change the algo to something which will likely be even easier to attack since it won't have ASICs. 

In a POS system, the minority can just keep forking away until the attacker runs out of money to purchase stake. "
"> PoS is the wrong way to look at security. Same error as those pushing for ASIC resistance.

I don't see the similarity at all.

Assuming PoS works as intended, it's nearly impossible to perform a >50% attack. You'd have to buy too many coins, raising the price while you do it. In PoW it would be possible for someone with lots of money to burn (think government). That's why PoS is more secure. And the cost of maintaining the stake is practically zero compared to the cost of mining."
"A lot of transactions on Ethereum are ""internal"", ex: smart contracts. Not a lot of people accept Ethereum because well the stuff they want isn't in ""the real world"", its in the contracts."
There are several scaling solutions in development, with the main one being [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ).
