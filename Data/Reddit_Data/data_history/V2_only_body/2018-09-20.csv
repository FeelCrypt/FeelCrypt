The market is stupid. BCH > BTC. You can go back to r/bitcoin 
Does this have anything to do with Bitcoin Cash?
Yeaap. that's me.
"now this is a face you can't hate.

You guys like to harp on the drugs and prostitution stuff. You know there were hitmen advertising on Silk Road? Plus, hard drugs kill people. If you sell poison to addicts, you should go to jail. I can virtually guarantee you someone died because of this shit. 
Hero.
Lmao Cobra, dangerous game spending time here. I've been on the same page as you since day 1 ðŸ˜‡
He's so handsome, he can't be a bad guy, right, right?

On other charges.
How many years to go until being freed?
"##### PETITION UPDATE

# [We've passed 80,000 signatures!](https://click.mail.change.org/?qs=668ddab035fc2ed556e86322134ee05703d737a513ab7657b04226386a1dd84c26d1899ca8477f6f64ae799c805ce6766c0a28e8919435310f28ed62e8b5476e)

We're on our way to six figures! Thanks so much for being part of Ross's struggle for freedom. It is our hope that his commutation willÂ shine a light on so many who are serving excessive sentences. Please share this petition and help us meet our goal!

[Read our update](https://www.change.org/p/13375503/u/23288427?utm_medium=email&utm_source=petition_update&utm_campaign=427651&sfmc_tk=B8SNfZBmHqSIOrNEe%2bNw0p4mtDqYue6QN%2bT3HKjqww6yQc4g81PwCAKAzOfHMBYy&j=427651&sfmc_sub=1368696238&l=32_HTML&u=65452626&mid=7259882&jb=129)"
Well apparently since economic laws didn't originate in the house as per official procedure, the government feels obliged to ignore those as well.
lol charge dropped for lack of evidences and you keep bringing that up?
">Tell that to the assassination targets

Which the charge has been dropped for lack of evidences?

> the addicts.

You mean the addicts that used his tool that they were freely using for their own fucking business which are absolutely not yours? 

Which one was actually forced to use his website? And how many addicts actually tried to sue him for that? Oh you mean none? k. 


Yup, totally deserve life sentence right? "
Thatâ€™s what amendments are for
I hope once he will be free(((
"I believe in peopleâ€™s freedom to choose sub optimally for themselves. 

"
The petition to completely censor technical drawings and schematics for guns has like twice the signatures as the petition to free Ross. This is fucking disgusting. Lets all go sign Ross's petition show them what we can do.
I agree. I'm not arguing that he should be in jail.
Ok, that aligns more with what I've read in other places. Thanks for the explanation!

"> Can you provide evidence that the ex employee was made up?

Well even if it is not made up, it is not a crime isnâ€™t as the murder didnâ€™t happen.

I can write in this message that I want to kill someone, that doesnâ€™t mean I have committed one."
"The ex employee was not made up the threat of him flipping on Ross was what was made up. 

The dude had no info to give them on Ross so they used what they knew and had the ex employee be the bait. 

There is a site dedicated to all of the cases someone has linked elsewhere if you're interested in getting a more complete picture of how Ross was being manipulated. It wasn't just those feds either. He had a lot of people extorting him for one reason or another basically because of newbie mistakes he had made. In every single instance he pays off the people like others threatening to dox him. There was an established pattern of him giving payouts to keep people quiet instead of paying to have them killed. This employee wasn't a threat to him if he had just ignored the ""warning"" he got from the corrupt agent and the idea didn't occur to have him killed until the agent suggested it."
How is this guy a danger to society? Hopefully heâ€™ll either be exonerated or convicted with time served so he can gtfo out of there and live the life he and everyone else deserves. 
Thanks for providing a source! /u/chaintip
Free Ross
and a power hungry politician wanted to look good. and a judge was willing to sacrafice her soul to be appointed a judge for the sole purpose of that trial.
sad :-(
"> He'd have happily had you assassinated for threatening his online drug website.

Wild claims requires wild evidences. 

That being said I'd happily had you put in jail for life without any evidence of whatsoever. The good thing is that would would happily agree with that :)"
Yeah so why didn't they make an amendment for drug prohibition the same way it was needed for alcohol prohibition? (The alcohol prohibition amendment was eventually repealed). Obviously the drug war is unconstitutional.
Between 5 and 10%
"> You guys like to harp on the drugs and prostitution stuff. You know there were hitmen advertising on Silk Road? 

Actually there were not.  This is another lie.  There were other markets for that sort of thing, but not Silk Road.  [Studies shows Silk Road actually reduced violence](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/silk-road-study/), so it actually saved  lives and kept people safer.  It is prohibition that kills, just ask Al Capone."
Hit jobs were banned on the silk road bro
Shit_Potato
Free that man
He'd have happily had you assassinated for threatening his online drug website. What a hero! He deserves every year of his life he'll spend wasting away in jail. 
You're a terrible person.
People are trafficking drugs and doing prostitution on craigslist right now probaby as well.  Should the owners of craigslist also be locked in a cage for life?
"Of course there is a small chance. Donald Trump is at least the most likely president to ever do it imo.

I still think weâ€™re looking at basically astronomical odds. "
He's talking about exposure as the only way to fight bad ideas. More bitcoiners should
Not quite in the same ballpark, but yeah that is a BS reason to get banned. 
Donald Trump would NEVER pardon Ross.
Yeah, technically he did a crime, but he doesn't deserve life. Though, the whole drug war should be dissolved and focus on keeping people clean. 
"> against allowing for gambling at the protocol level

At least this one point is being twisted by you.  From what I saw, he said that the oracles would have to be regulated, so its not really on the protocol level anyways.  We already have protocol betting like [chainbet protocol](https://github.com/fyookball/ChainBet/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md), and services like satoshidice that are enabled by bigger blocksizes and low fees.  Some protocol change options could be a danger when it comes to regulatory risks. And Calvin Ayre for example has been under [felony charges by federal prosecutors in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2017/07/14/former-online-gambling-billionaire-calvin-ayre-pleads-guilty-to-misdemeanor-charge/#e94e14053e37), so they are  probably aware of the dangers.  I also don't think its fair to say he wants to guide the direction of BCH, if that were the case maybe he would be dictator or something like that.  This is a decentralized protocol decided by POW mining, and the market, it doesn't work with one person in control."
"The numbers can't be directly compared though. How many people who want Ross freed also have a lack of faith that petitions can effect meaningful change or aren't interested in leaking personal information filling that out (or more likely both)?

Anti-gun drones both believe in the government and don't understand why privacy should exist, of course they would sign a petition."
I agree with you. you can read the chat log where he tried and pay the guy (undercover cop) to kill dude, and then where he tried to pay again to kill a guy's associate, and when he thought the guys innocent roommates could be witnesses he paid to have them (who would've been innocent bystanders) killed as well. People here act like just because Ross paid in bitcoin we're supposed to support him. I'm not going to support actions like that just because the person is a bitcoin enthusiast.
And Lynn too. She's been putting up a good fight for Ross!
Broken link
The petition to completely censor designs for guns has like twice the number of signatures as the petition to free Ross. The political morality of this population sickens me. 
"Government the tiny dot:

"> overcome the Government

Just like the Crown, my dude. Freedom is worth dying for"
Please keep this garbage user off r/btc
Victimless crime is bullshit concept
Yes. Freedom uber alles. Bitcoin is not a scientific experiment where we've to be careful not to overload relaying nodes, **Bitcoin is the way to economic freedom around the world**, which first and foremost means - more money in pockets of poor people
Yes all drug dealers get pardoned, lets go with that and stop posting about this criminal every month. 
"But will I ever get unbanned from /r/bitcoin?
My crime? [This post.](https://i.imgur.com/73AwRNl.png) "
"> He never trafficked drugs either

He did actually. You canâ€™t set-up something like Silk Road and expect some random drug dealer to be the first person to use the site. So the first merchant on the site was actually Ross under a different account name selling magic mushrooms heâ€™d grown in a cupboard. He discussed it in his journal, which was part of the court case."
Did he make any money from those sales?

Man, you're a piece of shit right?
Is this the hill that Bitcoin wants to die on?
Is she single?
He should kiss her.
"Some would be able to make a feeble case, that that was the intent of the drug war; to keep people clean.  

No, we need to just dismantle the drug war, and not try to solve everyoneâ€™s problems. Educate people, but let people have the freedom to make their own choices, whether theyâ€™re positive or negative. 

Sounds callous, but thatâ€™s how people figure their own shit out, through experience. "
yes please fuck off to facebook with this pathetic shit.
Tell that to the assassination targets or the addicts.
Tyranny lol Ross thought he was paying to have people murdered
If the charges were dropped, why are they keeping him in prison? 
"I really appreciate your comment. People downvoted me to oblivion, but never really showed anything that redeemed the guy. 

I understand his importance for demonstrating the use and value of cryptos, but that doesnâ€™t make him infallible. "
