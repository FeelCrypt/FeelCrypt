"So, you are saying optional 3rd party plugins are not safe.  The Core Wordpress and Woocommerce are pretty safe I think.

Wordpress is very popular, so it gets security audits and updates very often!"

"Shocking how [someone so objective](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7wnf9c/coinbase_launches_paypallike_service_for_paying/du2ss73) missed the part where BCH is six months old and LTC is six years old.

"> Bitcoin was created to combat and do away with.

Wait a minute.

For years, it was, ""Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank.""

Now you say ""Bitcoin does away with banks.""

So which is it?  Does Bitcoin let anyone, even Coinbase, be a bank? Or does Bitcoin not let anyone be a bank?  "
"Noup, Satoshis bitcoins are still sitting on his address.

On the other hand Charlie dumped all his coins on noobs during market ATH and just before crash."
"Yeah, double-edged sword right now, when congestion increases then it becomes costly.

Let's see how their scaling solution pans out."
"I understand that. I must be horrible at communicating this past 24 hours, because people seem to want to misconstrue my position.

At this time it is welcome, I simply see the inevitable path where these companies become the new banks and centralize the authority with themselves."
"Except I am not. I know Wordpress, PHP and their s*t plugins well enough from audits among other things. Mix that with a cryptocurrency, nothing good can come out of it.

Now, on another note, depending on how that is done it may be more secure than regular credit card payments."
Centralization does have it's perks.
extremely heavy traffic would be what Google is handling... Trust me I’m an engineer.
"Don't trust Charlie Lee. At first he was for a block size increase on BTC when it wasn't urgent. But when it became obvious that blocks were getting full he switched his position and campaigned against it. 

He sold his LTC so don't be surprised if he tries to cripple LTC too."
"totally a guy to trust....

https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc"
I have no investment in LTC so I don't exactly have a horse in this race. But, LTC handles more than double the amount of daily unique transactions that BCH does, so if youre saying the current transaction levels for LTC means no one wants to use it, what does that say about BCH?
You do realize if your coin is valued at $100/coin, then you're paying $15-50 to withdraw from any given exchange. Outside of Coinbase, it is impossible to buy a small amount of crypto altogether.
"Good catch :)

BTC Blockstream heavily promoting LTC, a token they have no intention of maintaining. Nice."
"Even if this is true...Bitcoin still eliminates the central banks and all the bad things that come from them. 

And Bitcoin 'banks' are still optional in a way current fiat banks are not.

Not gonna happen."
No he didn't - he supports it but the dev team doesn't. Litecoin's blocksize limit is 1mb. Do some research.
Great, we can now confirm that I made a point and then you ~~paid~~ made a totally tangential point.
"You are speaking only about the negative aspects of Wordpress/Woocommerce, the positive far outweigh the negative.

Positives such as massive compatibility other software, extremely useful plugins, widest range of customization and features.  For an ecommerce platform, its very useful since the downsides of some type of ""hack"" is very minimum.  At most, the hacker would be able to 1) take down your site 2) get user login information, which are both actually not really big deal for problems.  The most significant problems would be user Credit Card data security, however Woocommerce mostly does payment processing on 3rd party sites (like Stripe/Paypal), so you never see customer critical billing data, its all redirected to other secure sites.

So for an ecommerce site, there are very minimal risks, and very high rewards.  I can also setup my site to use my electrum public master key, to accept Bitcoin payments directly into my wallet.  Its open source software that has been tested and forked successfully.
https://github.com/sanchaz/bitcoin-cash-payments-for-woocommerce

That is a really powerful feature that lets you control payments 100% to your wallet, you can't have on sites like Amazon, Shopify or eBay.  So I understand your concern, but I do not think it is very applicable for ecommerce/shopping/blogging.  That is why Wordpress is the #1 software on the internet right now powering websites.

I will agree with you, if you were running anything more complicated than the above examples, such as any type of system that needed more intense user data management, I would definitely want a more secure system and not try to bootstrap with Wordpress.  For Wordpress/eCommerce however, at most you are getting user logins / past order history which is pretty low priority for hackers.  Billing information and credit card data is not at risk because it is handled off site."
"Couldn't leave it be. If I follow your mind state, people shouldn't support SpaceX because they are the only one who can deliver a payload to space with reusable rockets, making them a centralized service provider. Nobody is worried about it because when they become the norm, competition will arise.  It already did by Jeff bezos.

Back to crypto, first we had only Bitpay that's good enough for merchants. They are refusing to add Bitcoin Cash by the way. Now Coinbase is giving them a run for their money and you should be happy a second service provider is opening its doors, competing with the current centralized service provider. This is how it always will work with capitalism and there is nothing wrong with it. "
"Wordpress is not an ecommerce platform, is a clusterf*k of plugins and poorly written PHP often with vulnerabilities.

And bugs in Wordpress are common, leaving plenty of people exposed for long time because not always you can update the software without breaking the functionality of your site. You are forced to use Apache over things like Nginx often because of rewrite rules, etc. The xmlrpc.php functionality enabled by default simply causes a DoS in your site as soon as people attack it, they can bruteforce your users easily in the core Wordpress, etc.

Plus, it is slow because of PHP, and it was in fact a blogging platform. But as I said, I am not trying to convince you or anything.

Feel free to do as you please."
Thank you for re-iterating. Do you have anything constructive to contribute?
I'm done. You continue to introduce tangential topics, as though I am taking the opposite position as you are. I am tired of this. Goodbye.
ebay is terrible, I use them also, and they can't even figure out to get the rates straight between what they charge the buyer and what they charge you, and its usually against my favor :(  Also, I'm sure those private companies would not disclose hacks or vulnerabilities publicly in the same way open source software like Wordpress does.
"
>My point, if it went over your head, is that these services are simply the new ""banking"" services that Bitcoin was created to combat and do away with.

So what if there are dozens, or even thousands of new banks (which is what these service providers are, effectively; they're still just banks

You straight up call them banks and you claim that they are the same as what bitcoin was designed to ""combat""

"
"Okay, let's call them banks. You still can choose to keep your coins on your ledger and are not forced to use them in any way if you don't feel like it. That's the point, you don't HAVE to. You CAN if you want and a lot of people will because of incentives they are going to give like ease of use, but you are not obligated to partake in it and can still have a life where you can store you value and use it as a means of payment. What is wrong with banks now, is that there is no choice.

I don't think we're getting through to each other."
"> . Woocommerce is 40% + of ecommerce on the entire we

That is a big *no* and if you had some common sense you would know that as well.

But look, I gave my arguments, I do not need to convince you and I am not going to overextend myself. Do some research and find out by yourself if your ""woocommerce"" thing is serious or if you would be better away from that.

Hint: Amazon does not use woocommerce, ebay does not use a blogging platform with a plugin written in PHP to sell products. There must be at least a couple of reasons for that."
"JFC... ""I believe"", ""**if** they continue down the path they are taking.""
"
"> Look, Coinbase or any centralized service provider in the blockchain era, will never be a bank as we know it.

Look, centralized service providers that provide the same services as banks are, effectively, banks. A credit union, while not called a bank, offers the same services as a bank. Only those that feel the need to play semantics do not call them banks. I do my banking at a credit union.

""As we know it"" is where you want to plant your sword and die on. For all intents and purposes these ""service providers"" will, IMO, become the future banks if they continue down the path they are on.

> What is wrong with banks right now, is that they take your money, loan it out 10 times through risky constructions and you are at their mercy.

What makes you think that Coinbase, and other similar services, are not operating under the same, or similar principle?

> No service provider will be able to do that with Bitcoin Cash, not now, not ever.

Where there is a will, there is a way. The financial sector will find a way to do it, just as they found a way to bundle sub-prime mortgages into securities which they then sold and profited from.

> There will be centralized financial service providers, and there is nothing wrong with that as long as they have utility other than speculating with my or your money.

JFC.. It seems as though you've glommed on to this notion that I do not believe that the services that Coinbase, and similar financial institutions, are offering as not useful, how can you continue this line of reasoning when I've already addressed it?"
"Wordpress is safe.  Woocommerce is 40% + of ecommerce on the entire web.  There might be some small issues here and there, but they are patched right away.

Also, the damage it could cause is pretty minimal.  Even worst case scenario doesn't seem very bad.  Hardly anyone would actually store CC data on Wordpress database.

You might point to some smaller software that you think is safer, but its far less tested so there could very well be huge exploits that they don't find for a long time because of low use."
Your entire argument is based off you thinking you can see the future, sure its a possibility, but you are passing it off as an absolute. 
Look, Coinbase or any centralized service provider in the blockchain era, will never be a bank as we know it.

"First of all, a plugin for a garbage blog system (with all due respect) purely based in PHP is not a serious thing. Not if you want to do lot of business...

Second, Wordpress itself is a clusterfuck of plugins and hacks, like... ""custom fields"". Full of vulnerabilities: https://www.cvedetails.com/product/4096/Wordpress-Wordpress.html?vendor_id=2337

Even Magento GO (PHP as well) closed their cloud business probably because it was hard to keep it secure and maintain it.

So, you are better off staying away from any PHP based ecommerce, or at least use something for the purpose (Magento, Prestashop even).

And if you are looking for something fast for selling two products just use shopify or bigcommerce and call it a day."
"> You are still very confused.

No, I am not. I'm simply looking further ahead and looking at the inevitable.

> You can call them banks, they are not banks.

I call them banks because that is inevitably what they will be come if they continue down the path they are taking.

> You can call BTC bitcoin, it is not bitcoin.

Are you under the impression that I am a BTC supporter? 

BTC is bitcoin, but not Bitcoin. This is where we both can play semantics. Do you really want to go down that path?

> You can give your own definitions to words, doesn't make them what you think the are.

I think you are purposefully missing my point, just so you can win this stupid argument. I'm calling them banks because that is what I believe they will inevitably become if they continue down the path they are taking. The main service they are not providing, at this time, is credit based upon the deposits that they hold.
"
second question, could you name any hack into Woocommerce in the past 6 months that caused vendors to lose money?
It is still php garbage. Not serious for an ecommerce.
You get raped by withdrawal fees when you withdraw Bcash, too. No coin is usable 
if you want to promote rbtc as a censorship-free forum where you welcome dissenting opinions, it’s not good practice to call everyone who disagrees with you an astroturfing paid shill. Or to use some bot to show what a user’s post history reveals about their bias. To the contrary, it shows you engage in witch hunts and don’t truly welcome other opinions besides those that are pro-BCH.
Everyone who owned BTC got BCH though, which should boost usage considerably compared to a completely new blockchain created 6 months ago. Only mentioning the fact that BCH only is 6 months old is not exactly being objective either.
Unlike Lee, Ver didn't create BCH nor does he control it.
Really? When? What is it now? When was the last LTC HF?
"> So which is it?

Both. The two are not mutually exclusive.

> Does Bitcoin let anyone, even Coinbase, be a bank?

Yes. Have I stated otherwise?

> Or does Bitcoin not let anyone be a bank? 

It does. 

When I say banks, especially within the context of discussing Bitcoin and its properties, one should already have in mind that it is the centralization aspect of the banking power that I am talking about.

The companies, Coinbase and similar entities, are providing a valuable service at this time. Please do not try to paint me as ignorant in regards to their current value. But these companies are simply taking the place as the middle man between the consumer and the business, this is partially what Bitcoin was created do away with.

if they don't, then what is the advantage to use that service? because you can already easily send cryptos anywhere quickly...
"I use both on a site. My opinion. Both do the basic well, which includes taking the BTC and giving me the USD. Both let you adjust the percentage. Both had good integration capabilities to add to your site.

I personally prefer Coinbase for its usability. If a customer has a Coinbase account, the transaction is instant and free. While they also support ETH, LTC and BCH wallets, you can't accept funds directly, but it does mean I can accept those in other ways and send them to the same account. Has a USD account so I can keep funds there or payout to the bank. Their merchant reports are terrible.

BitPay works, but it's management and reports are also basic. I have little control how and when USD funds are paid out. It's only BTC. They charge an extra fee for a 2nd mining transaction (charge the customer to move the BTC from the incoming wallet to my wallet - except I don't have a wallet, I convert to USD, so it's a bit of a scam). They changed their payment integration to only accept their [payment protocol](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005701523-Which-wallets-work-for-a-BitPay-payment-Which-wallets-are-compatible-) which isn't support by all wallets, especially not hardware ones. If you have a ledger it's impossible to make a payment to BitPay without using 3rd party software.
"
The article says BitPay has 100,000 merchants. Coinbase has 50,000. 
Ya. Really glad Coinbase are doing this. Puts the pressure on.
There is for Nano. Don't know if you can shapeshift BCH to Nano yet...
It's maybe worth it to see if Coinbase is using lightning channels for payments (or will). If this is the case, I don't see a problem.
"I can’t imagine sellers will say no if circumventing credit card companies by using crypto leads to lower fees.

Why does this not exist yet?"
This what OmiseGO is attempting to do. No product yet. 
Interesting idea
Agreed. BitPay needs to step up or they'll fade into oblivion soon enough. 
Yeah
"Yes that would be great. BCH, we got spending to do ;-) "
"Better to ask if the BCH transaction fees used by them will be a constant 1 satoshi per byte or less.

Right now you can use BCH fees close to the fees used by BTC and it will still sound ""wow so much lower"".  But that's an illusion, that's why its never a good idea to ask how many USD the transaction fees will be."
this has to be a must. I do think many exchanges make a fortune charging the same fees for all coins and when quizzed they just point to the high charges with Bitcoin Core
Don't confuse protocol fees with processing fees.
So is this an off chain solution? You can pay from your Coinbase account only? Doesn't seem like much. Honestly pointless and counterproductive to adoption. This isn't a Bitpay BCH competitor by the looks of it. 
Coinbase is not a company to trust
Does this convert to local fiat?
"So, right now r/bitcoin is very happy about Coinbase implementing Segwit soon. Now, I wonder how long it will take with this launch for the BTC mempool to clog up again. 

Not very long I imagine, even with Segwit."
"And bam bitcoin cash is smashed?

Turns out decentralization was the most important factor and many private companies can offer low cost second layers.

If said companies ever attempt censorship the users can bypass them by transacting on the main chain at a cost 

"
Still take a week to get any cryptocurrency, garbage.
So, we hate the decentralized payment layers that Bitcoin and Ethereum devs have been working on because AXA paid one of the developers a salary, but we love the centralized one from Coinbase that will happily freeze your funds if you couldn't provide a valid proof-of-source-of-funds that they liked? Satoshi's Vision™ is alive and well!
Bye bye Request Network!
Will they do Chargebacks or refunds for fraud?
Oh, dope shit.
Lol paypal im not interested 
Wow. Huge news. Good for them.
If this doesn’t light a fire under BitPay’s ass, I don’t know what will.
This is a BitPay competitor, right?
I’m assuming the merchants can have the option to convert immediately to fiat or hold the coins. 
I trust them more then any other exchanges... I just wish that they would fix their servers so that they could start being able to handle heavy loads...
Request eventually.
that as well...
Missed that. 
Yes I agree that's why I'm wondering
"As this is a bridge from crypto to fiat it's unavoidable and a very important step to not needing to convert back to fiat at all, making these services mostly unnecessary.

This is very welcome."
"Most businesses want to deal with their local fiat for accounting, better short term price stability, and regulations. So they need a payment processor to instantly convert the accepted crypto payment into fiat.

You are still your own bank with this setup, and the merchant still gets a cash equivalent that can't be reversed and so can lower their price if they so choose. And you get to spend your crypto at more places, which is good right?

With time more merchants will hopefully choose to keep the payment crypto and pass along the savings of skipping the conversion to fiat which I'm guessing is close to or a little less than what credit cards charge merchants.


"
Missed that. 
I hope they do support Lightning Channels just to show how unfriendly it is for eCommerce. The masses will not use such a monstrosity. Lightning Network is dead on release, but don't take my word for it! Let's all wait and see. 😂
I get what you're saying.  There is absolutely no need for this intermediary.  Just pay the merchant directly.
Yep. BitPay card only backed by BTC. Shift card through Coinbase uses all the coins supported by Coinbase.
Did Satoshi spend Bitcoin on any chain recently? I would think that would be front page news on Reddit
"4 cents?! Yikes! 

I am a poorbrokebastard and I can't afford to pay more than 1 cent so I have to stick with BCH."
They are already dealing with extremely heavy traffic! Trust me I’m an engineer.
"Thanks for the inputs. 

I think the double fee they charge is to be able to move that money at all. Be it to your wallet or to the wallet of the person who's selling you the USD. 

The payment protocol is good, but not allowing other options was quite bold and dangerous of theirs."

"LTC isn't even remotely close to having full blocks. It can handle a significantly higher volume than it already processes and fees are 4 cents per transaction, so the notion that ""fees are far lower"" on LTC is a bit absurd. Plus, LTC's block confirmation time is only 2.5 minutes compared to BCH's 10 minutes so merchants who prefer speed would go with LTC over BCH."

"Sorry about paragraph form bc it looks combative & annoyingly long usually but I just need to break it up for my sake so I don't forget anything.

> Hey man. I have you set as a friend on Reddit and have you listed as someone smart and knowledgeable on EOS. So I can see you have some bias that would make you think like that. I see EOS and to ETH as ETH was to BTC, so I have the utmost respect for Vitalik and the ETH team, and I'm still invested in ETH as it's good to diversify.

I see all crypto as a multi component system that has a different take on some or all aspects of components required to create a decentralized platform. Due to trade offs in almost every design aspect they rarely are purely advancing on previous systems and are best compared independently - this would be my suggestion of the bias I see immediately in response. Seeing something as an advanced or extended version of previous would make assumption it's an improvement, when it's almost impossible to have strict improvements in every aspect in a field this young. In addition, a single broken component compromises all else and can render them useless.

> I'm just disappointed that you hold these opinions, as you must be a smart guy. Maybe you're right and Vitalik is the best scam artist I've ever seen, but all I've ever seen from him is intellectual honesty and regular ol' honesty and politeness. Nobody is perfect, and according to my research, the resources you've provided seem to be mixed with non-arguments or very small nitpicky of where ETH/Vitalik got it wrong, but owned up to their mistakes.

I agree with fluffypony's view on crypto that many projects end up ""[indistinguishable from a scam](https://youtu.be/OgXJr1OOi0Y?t=642) due to gross negligence"" in view for a 3rd party as we cannot read their intent, instead of guessing which it is they should be treated based on results. Ethereum takes the stance of marketing, ignoring criticism, ignoring best practices, applauding breaking things instead of ""do no harm"" principle something that people depend on with their well-being should.

> A lot of those links are old and the issues have been fixed.

I'm not sure what you mean since the links are historic facts to demonstrate the incompetence or dishonest behavior and biggest ones like 70% premine or possibility of repeat abuse of said premine haven't been addressed.

> As for the DAO fiasco, I'm glad to have the debate, but I don't believe code can be the ultimate law when there is the possibility of unforseen consequences. I think there needs to be some permanent fix for this fundamental issue, but for now, ETH is in its early stages and I appreciate they forked. One investor said that's how he knew he made a sound investment.

Asking for debate suggests you think this is a matter of opinion, when I argue it's a matter of historic observable actions and requires no subjectivity. A lot of people who assume they know what was demonstarted actually never read about it in detail and see a lot of new info the moment they read outside of ethereum subreddits.

I also don't agree that code can be ultimate law, but that's not what the issue is. They didn't just ignore the code or blockchain security. We are talking about individuals here who very specifically also created terms and conditions and marketing material specifically advertising the treatment of code in their platforms, both in Eth ([here](https://i.imgur.com/LMJKMNc.png)) and DAO [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oqivm/the_dao_was_not_hacked_the_mt_gox_of_ethereum/d4evlln/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oiqj7/critical_update_re_dao_vulnerability/d4cy4v0/), incredibly uniquely in all of history. So they broke their own promises and statements as well, which is partially why they do not deserve trust.

This ethereum developer wrote [a great statement for why they don't deserve trust as well.](http://i.imgur.com/IStgCuO.png)

> After all, who would want to invest in something where all of their money can be gone because of an unforseen bug? 

This isn't about building systems that aren't reversible or editable or doesn't have protection - you can build all those on top of secure platforms.

It's about centralization of control not just theorized, but demonstrated perfectly. That means ethereum being unsecure was demonstrated & not addressed. Decentralization is not about infrastructure alone, it's also about incentives & careful decentralization and decentralized wide distribution of incentives & control to independent entities. It's near impossible to get perfect, but so easy to choose the worst possible options of many.

It's also about people dishonestly marketing something as decentralized or immutable and in a moment where their own money was at risk proving none of it was true and yet still marketing in same manner afterwards. They also [lied about it being a community decision when it was not](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/) when they very clearly forced it to come out their way and it can only have come out their way. This is about individuals lying about their product in order to get money, which is exactly by definition what scammers do. They not only broke their own statements, but lied about results, and are still lying whenever they call ethereum decentralized after proving it's not. Incompetence or malice? No idea, doesn't matter, might as well be both.

So I don't repeat what was already written about in as good detail as it gets, I can almost promise you will see new info if you actually read any of these favorites:

In effect Vitalik et al. :

* centrally premined over 70% of the incentive driving coins (centralization)
* used one of worst possible methods (ICO) to distribute some of the coins (unsecure stake distribution, centralized funding)
* broke own statements and promises & projects statement and promises when bailing out the 3rd party project the DAO (which were if anything putting blame on contract writers rather than ""attacker"" or bad investors, also called manipulation of a security legally)
* did not have consensus of the network on the bailout itself by any measure (4% and 9% according to polls)
* lied to exchanges the network will switch regardless causing them harm & clearly knowing he didn't have full support. This not only gave them the name, it made the value of resistance to change exactly 0. (forced decision)
* refused to reveal if they were invested in the DAO, many were found to be including Vitalik (bias)
* took a side of bailout, held centralized funding & premine & thus updates and dev work hostage to make the decision one about support and profit rather than about bailout being necessary (centralization of control actually used)
* hard coded it as a [default](http://i.imgur.com/EQGNm4A.png) with [12 hour notice](http://i.imgur.com/6onio8h.png) taking advantage by deciding for anyone relying on automation or apathetic - [literally can never lose](https://i.imgur.com/i9InG68.png) and why ethical developers don't set these kind of changes to default
* 12 hour thing is not only ignoring any hint of consensus, but also demonstrates how prone they as developers are to rush code without proper review, which we saw in recent rushed updates before major HF and the black list failed soft fork opening up the chain to ddos attacks.
* used their premine to damage value of resistance to change directly when it did get value, not given to the development of the chain and design it was given to (so market manipulation, consensus manipulation, and theft)
* hell, some Ethereum Foundation members even hacked the old chain, sent money to exchanges to damage the value further, doing exactly what the supposed ""attacker"" was doing.

How exactly has this been fixed? It hasn't. Instead they are introducing a highly centralizing proof of stake pushing these issues into next gear based on premine, bad distribution, and pareto alone.

EOS isn't perfect either, but Dan had put in place tons of design features to address all of Ethereum's failures to where at least it's less bad. I can go into this in more detail later bc I quizzed Dan on these issues almost a year ago & he shocked me by having thought of all of them in detail and giving excellent answers.

part 2 following as reply"
"> I've looked towards the potential counterparty offers. I've read your posts and I respect you taking the time to write. Seems in return some core devs have consistently resorted to aggression and ad hominems. Baffling. As i see counterparty has implementrd workarounds to avoid censorship and have added things like batching, and segwit soon iirc. Does not even require touching an 'alt coin'- you can directly issue an asset on the blockchain with btc only and store it on the blockchain. Then there is the possibility of trustless p2p exchange.

Remember, even *if* you have to own XCP directly to use premium features of Counterparty.io, those transactions will prima facie never clear without being etched onto the Bitcoin blockchain. This can't happen without also increasing the demand for block space on Bitcoin as opposed to block space on Ethereum. Unfortunately this point has been utterly lost on the likes of Greg Maxwell, and it's been inarguably to Bitcoin's [*great* detriment](https://coinmarketcap.com).

> Considering the fact the founders of the project chose not to immediately enrich themselves and instead 'burnt' btc then began innovating silently which is more or less saintly compared to hundreds of other projects, (it may even be the minority exception) To this day I am absolutely baffled to go back and look at some of the core devs pervasive and absolutetly venomous attacks on the project (censoring transactions, resorting to verbal aggression, reducing features, advocating lowering block size. You're absolutely right that a huge amount of capital and mindshare was ferried away into a project which now competes against bitcoin due to unnecesary hostility. There will be no doubt billions of dollars of value add on top of the eth chain, many for now may be worthless, or outright scams even but over time the market will mature and correct. I simply cannot understand where seemingly respected and rational actors have such hate and how they refuse to acknowledge that things could have been done better.

This is precisely why I believe Counterparty.io's proof-of-burn event set off a chain reaction which culminated in Bitcoin Core's aggressively anti-metacoin stances; the extreme backlash we faced at the time was entirely due to the uncontested *legitimacy* of our platform and in particular the uncanny resemblance of our approach to that taken by Satoshi Nakamoto himself to launch Bitcoin to the world. Shortly thereafter we began hearing about 2WP sidechains, and how we of course were doing the equivalent of clubbing baby seals by ""piggybacking"" XCP on top of BTC, reasoning be damned."
"Vitalik and all of the people promoting obvious scam like ethereum or onecoin or bitconnect are either scammers or illiterate but in effect indistinguishable from scammers, no exceptions. Ethereum is one of the best and most proven examples of a centralized project without involving any opinion which is why it's so easy to accurately describe people promoting it.

BCH has at least proper wide distribution because it was bitcoin so you don't see me calling it a scam ever. 

We're talking about a guy who voluntarily for selfish profit by choice decided to centrally premine over 70% of Eth supply and his previous project was raising money for a simulated quantum computer nonsense to break bitcoin any freshman who knows anything about hash functions and overhead can conclude makes no sense.

Vitalik is one of the worst people in the human race right now whether he intended to be a scammer or not and probably cost the world a ton in money put in by others while doing nothing more than putting people in security risk. At these market caps the drain on world resources is up there if not higher than money drained by war on ISIS. That's the type of people he should be grouped with - scammers and malicious unethical people, as far from Satoshi's or many other altcoin devs pursuit of knowledge as it gets."
"> You could question what the rules should be for when to fork, but I think it's going back to the fundamental issue that rules cannot be hard and fast because any case can be completely different than the possible scenarios you've envisioned when creating the rules. This is why most judges rule based on the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law.

same as above - community had no effective say on the matter. Judges, dev investors & holders of the premine & funding from premine, changed the independent decision to one about new centrally decided incentives. It didn't matter what was advertised when sold before. They set the new ""law"" to default, required people to opt-out, and fiscally punished those opting out. 12 hours was absurd notice for fundamental edits.

> I envision the future of smart contracts to include a provision that states any party can opt for an agreed upon party / oracle (one person or most likely a group chosen by a system like Augur) to have the final say in settling the contract. Even if we're able to fix coding mistakes with proofs, being able to envision every edge case scenario for a rule / law is a bit further down the road.

You can build all those on top of secure platforms, yes. You can even have all those as part of platform, formalized, that leaves little to guesses - basically what bitshares dpos did in 2014 as the worlds first DAO & decentralized funding mechanism. Note Ethereum came out after & decided against using that type of formalization and still resists any formalization of the rules they want to keep abstract (which actually might be rational given their horrific distribution) but then has no issues with proof of stake formalizing premine & bad distribution control. Again, incompetence or malicious intent - no idea which.

> Onto security: I'm not fully aware, but has there been a major security flaw in ETH's code? I'm not taking about dapps or third party code. Maybe you'd say ETH could have been coded better to prevent third party code from being vulnerable, but hindsight is 20/20, is there something you can point to that was really egregious / foolish?

I can pick on many aspects of Eth code, but that exists in every platform, and so insigificant compared to centralization that started with a premine that wouldn't be seen in the code. Code either makes assumptions on secure distribution or ignores the concept entirely in its design and those are just as much of a flaw as having code mistakes seeing how cryptocurrencies are more than hardware and software, and that is the genius invention of decentralization that Satoshi is credited with.

> As for centralization, it hasn't been a problem for any cryptocurrency yet, and if it happens, the community can and will fork to keep it decentralized. I feel like the bigger issue crypto solved was how to incentivize open source projects. As long as a project is open source, it can be picked up if a carrier falls down.

Again, code forks or network forms aren't the only part of decentralization. The centralized funding and incentives are part of the problem. Premines can be used to attack dissent value and thus incentives and security. Centralized funding creates direct competition that, as demonstrated by Ethereum, can market its properties rather than have those properties (like decentralization) and gain value propelling this scam further.

It has been an issue  in Ethereum. It has been an issue in Bitconnect. It has been an issue in Onecoin. It has been an issue in Bitcoin. It's an issue in every project to some degree. What we might debate is number of people already hurt vs everyone still at risk of being hurt in future. It's often not about being perfectly decentralized as like immutability it's unattainable goal, it's about using best tools at the time and not choosing the worst options at the time. Ethereum Foundation decided to premine and decided to do all those things and thus demonstrating not only security failure, near perfect centralization, but also lack of ethics or understanding to actually use them - something incredibly rare to see. I can say Ripple is centralized because of premine and central decisions on which nodes have control, but I don't have evidence of them abusing that YET. Well, in Ethereum, that's not the case - we not only know of the premine, we saw it literally used.

 
> TBH, I skimmed the link that claimed to show ""no ""legitimate"" developer respects Vitalik, as a lot of them I know of as Bitcoin maximalists, or who I like to say belong to the cult of Bitcoin Core, which I know is a fallacy, but I don't want to waste my time either, so if you feel one is particularly insightful, feel free to link me to it. 

Bitcoin Core is 500+ people and has agreement with majority of experts & studies results in design aspects. It's volunteers and not a company and bases decisions on studies rather than emotions or popularity.

> Also, saying ""no legitimate developer"" is like the no true Scotsman fallacy. 

I can see how you can confuse it, as in can always find excuse to call someone ""no true developer"". In this case, any developer who supports Ethereum project is by definition not a legitimate developer as support of a proven centralized premined project demonstrates lack of tech-literacy in the field and renders their opinion irrelevant on any matter related to decentralization. It's not used to prove ethereum centralization, it's stated a result of ethereum's obvious centralization.

> Even some of those links had praise for Vitalik, such as Greg Maxwell saying he's kind and polite, but he felt he was naive (I feel like Vitalik proved him wrong in the end, but maybe you'd say ETH is still on course for a crash, I'm not going to argue), and the Cornell professor also saying he has respect for Vitalik. I mean, you also linked to a thread that said people don't respect the implementation of ETH, not Vitalik.

Again, this comes down to negligence, maliciousness, or dishonesty being identical to a 3rd person. I don't think everything Vitalik has done is bad in design lets say (although for entertainment I might exaggerate that way) seeing how he borrowed from many existing concepts (often without giving credit), but overall I think he's either not trustworthy or not honest or not tech-literate (quantum computer scam). It's hard to give proper criticism while also being polite given the extent of some actions, and accuracy should take priority for discussion about security tech.

fluffy's main point he came back to many times was Vitalik's lack of knowledge in mathematics, which might be too harsh as he can learn it. better criticism was one of centralization. even better would be to point out how Vitalik is prone to relying on mathematics for proofs instead of reasoning that causes him to pay little attention to assumptions his mathematics takes in. I saw this a lot in academia - people often using all kinds of advanced expressions to prove a point only to be shown incorrect easily by colleagues in the set up of the problem. this is also used by those trying to show off superior knowledge, (like when intoxicated) which I think is funny at right moment, but often a bad approach for serious problem solving.

> I'm thoroughly against ""maximalists"" who treat any crypto as a religion where nothing about their favorite platform can be impugned. I've been researching enough that I know this space is way to complex to be arrogant enough to be sure of anything, so I'm always open to new ideas and criticisms,especially for the projects and people I like, which is why I find it disappointing that you have this tone and attitude like you're 100% right that Vitalik is a bad person.

None of this is about maximalism, I don't believe in perfect projects, I think they are all flawed, and we sort them based on least bad. I am completely open to my so far positive view on dpos or pow or even best distribution methods being challenged. I also don't believe in middle ground fallacy that both sides have valid arguments and truth is somewhere in the middle. Sometimes it's more effective to categorize stuff as wrong given enough evidence & sound reasoning which to me Ethereum's case for being centralized has done spectacularly.

I just don't see how ethereum's near perfect centralization can be questioned so far yet I often ask to show a single thing wrong with for example [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/) to prove that wrong which in turn would put a question into ethereum's centralization. But since it's just analyzing actions and publicly known information without trying to guess intent, ethereum's centralization is so far unchallenged. 

> I feel like if Vitalik, Dan, and ethereumcharles
>  (the leaders in the ""platform space"" imo) were to have a weekly discussion on Reddit, with community input on what questions should be asked going forward, the space would be a whole lot better and more progress would be made. What ends up happening is some form of debate is tried, there's a difference of opinion, and one person ends up leaving to try and prove their idea right. I guess it's an okay way to solve problems, but not an efficient one. If people had an open mind, they can all work together as a community and progress the field 1000x more quickly.

> Looking forward to an open and honest reply, if you'd like.

It would be amazing. Maybe someone from bitcoin camp like Peter Todd & Monero dev Ricardo (FluffyPony), and maybe someone knowledgeable but a good speaker like DeRose to guide conversation. But it would be very hard to be impersonal when criticizing the tech and decisions some of these people took. Ricardo coined expression ""scammers that don't know they are scammers"" to describe so many that might honestly not understand what they are doing is so dangerous and potentially harmful that its indistinguishable from intending to be scammers.

Ta has limited use because of BTC dominance, whales, non regulation , FUD, FOMO ,...

I still hope the market will grown, we get some company money flowing in and BTC dominance lessens. But BCH plays no role in any of that, it will just remain one of the coins for payments."
You geniuses need to google the word subtle and reread everything again.
I agree it's not the ONLY reason but it is by far the most significant. Futures, and market manipulation by the banker elite also has had a great deal of impact. That said, it is without doubt the predominant reason for the crash, and the ability to subsequently predict and profit from said crash. These decisions set the stage for the banker elite to take advantage of crypto as a whole, but particularly new investors, by manipulating the value of BTC (and thus all cryptocurrencies), making BTC a shit investment, tanking the market, and profiting massively. They wouldn't have had the self-assurance of success in this strategy had BTC itself remained uncompromised, and at root, you can bet your fucking ass this whole thing has origins in the intelligence apparatus.
wasn't aware that bitcoin was back to being $1/coin ??
"but you can only correct back to something...bitcoin wasn't ever at/above 20k so you can't recover upto it... general upward drift could potentially be an upwards correction, but not usually a price explosion.

Sorry I said the same about bitcoin itself: its never going to become mainstream means of payment. And i was right. While bch is better its far from good enough to become something like that.

We’re not in the middle of a correction... it’s a trend reversal. 
One thing I like about this chart is that it refers to all downward-price action in BTC as a correction, which is definitely the case seeing as how the coin is functionally useless. You heard it here first folks, BTC true value <$3.80
https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/7wo6hm/typical_corrections_42_over_3_days_or_20_days/
Anything before 2013 is irrelevant as nobody had even heard about bitcoin. 2014 crash was because people heard about it for the first time it the price inflated. 2017 was finally when it went relatively mainstream. This could continue but the blockchain wasnt even 1/100th ready for the low usage it has gotten recently. Unless things change radically, there is no hope for another bullrun.
Nice compilation, but we don't know the current correction is over just yet.
Yeah, I was around for all of those crashes, from mid-2011 to now.
And we never will if you zoom out far enough and let time do it’s thing.
I declare it over, right now 
Yes, but we can compare the 70% correction with the other corrections. 87% being the worst so far.

"> Which is a radical change from the original design.

yes, it is a change - but change is the nature of the universe. 

> Allowing larger block would have allowed for the same fee revenue with lower individuals fees, allow more use case, more growth and therefore more decentralisation.

this is mostly speculation. I do agree that 1MB is for the most part an arbritary number. Could of easily been 2MB or perhaps even 4MB. However, i think you will find is that most of Core believe this as well - they just dont believe in Blocksize being the method from which you achieve scaling. 

> BCH returning to the original design.

this is a flase narrative as well. You don't have the original design. you have changed a number of things including the DAA - which in turn effects the game theory. 

> If it is not arguing for mining centralisation what it is?

centralisation and decentralisation has nothing to do with how large or small the mining operations are  - do you not realise this? It concerns the distribution of the mining operations around the world. 1000 large miners operating in 100 countries is much more effective than 1000 hobby miners operating in 100 countries. Security is in distribution of hashpower - not distribution of nodes. 

> This is in essence the mining centralisation force at play with high fees.

you are basically arguing against economies of scale. a business (for the most part) will always become more profitable the larger it gets as business can leverage its size to its advantage. This is what is happening in your example. all the high transaction fees do is raise the investement barrier to entry (to enter profitably you need to run a larger operation), and this does not neccesarily mean more centralisation - as described above.

For the same fee revenue per block, the higher the blocksize, the lower the individual tx fees are.

If a 1MB generate $10.000 of fees revenue with 2.000tx ($5 per tx) a 100MB would generate the same revenue with $0.5 tx fees average.

>&gt; BCH returning to the original design.

>this is a flase narrative as well. You don't have the original design. you have changed a number of things including the DAA - which in turn effects the game theory. 

The way the difficulty is calculated has no bearing on the currency characteristics, it is not even detailed in the white paper.

One adjustment every 2000 is a very “naive” way to calculate difficulty and will very likely force BTC to do an emergency HF in the future IMO.

>&gt; If it is not arguing for mining centralisation what it is?

>centralisation and decentralisation has nothing to do with how large or small the mining operations are  - do you not realise this? It concerns the distribution of the mining operations around the world. 1000 large miners operating in 100 countries is much more effective than 1000 hobby miners operating in 100 countries. 

High fees will not lead to thousands miner with small operation, as small miner cannot compete, it will lead to a handful very large operation.

Very harmful outcome, much worst than large block.

>Security is in distribution of hashpower - not distribution of nodes. 

Why are you talking about nodes when we are talking about mining?

>&gt; This is in essence the mining centralisation force at play with high fees.

>you are basically arguing against economies of scale. a business (for the most part) will always become more profitable the larger it gets as business can leverage its size to its advantage. This is what is happening in your example. all the high transaction fees do is raise the investement barrier to entry (to enter profitably you need to run a larger operation), and this does not neccesarily mean more centralisation - as described above. 

No economy of scale already exist with Bitcoin, this phenomenon (high fees) is added on top of it.

Like you say, raising even more the barrier to entry. AKA increasing mining centralisation.

"Where is the ""force""?"
"In this situation, where is the force upon people that are not party to any contracts? If you are referring to the FBI breaking into Roddy McDowall's home, I agree that this is a use of force. But, I suspect in the future, if not already, the IP producers here (move makers), will / can encrypt a movie so that no one can open it without being given authorization (code contract).

People are working on this:

One in place, the use of force is unnecessary. Unless you are referring to the defensive force of the code preventing someone from stealing the movie (physical and intellectual work).

"> This is not a justification for changing the economics characteristics of a currency against community consensus.

Against community consensus? What?! Miners agreed to adopt SW. The fact that they didn't then get 2x is another issue. 

> No it is not speculative, it is math.

> For the same fee revenue per block, the higher the blocksize, the lower the individual tx fees are.

It's not how it works at all! 

The fee market is a bidding process, not simple division of transactions into blockage. 

> The way the difficulty is calculated has no bearing on the currency characteristics, it is not even detailed in the white paper.

It has bearings on the economic incentives, though, does it not?

> High fees will not lead to thousands miner with small operation, as small miner cannot compete, it will lead to a handful very large operation.

Complete speculation - again. 

> Why are you talking about nodes when we are talking about mining?

Because you keep talking about small miners, and decentralisation. I assume these small miners are running a node at home, and running mining software and pointing it to a pool. This is what you are on about, no? 

> No economy of scale already exist with Bitcoin, this phenomenon (high fees) is added on top of it.

Adding on top of it? It's an economy of scale, with respect to how the network is operating. Yes, it raises the barrier further, but it's still part of the same function.
