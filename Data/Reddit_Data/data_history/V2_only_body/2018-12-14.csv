"That's a classy comment from a smutty account.

Bravo pornhub Aria."
What if the Litecoin consents tho
Currently, a way under-appreciated comment! 
Wow, tell me more about the flappening? I like it.
The wut?
Lol. 
">the attacks


Mind pointing one out? "
this sounds like a risky click
He got that FU money now
Are you blocked?
At the very least it goes to motive.  If he had been holding a large amount of ltc at the time of the tweet, you could say he's just trying to further his own finances.  If he holds none, then his motive is elsewhere.

2018  -> tweet of the year...  But I know you and your special mind already 💁‍♂️
Didn't he sell in 2018 or very late 2017? Sounds like it fits fine for tweet of the last year.
"Typically when people say ""Best ___ of *the year*"", well...the rest should be self-explanatory. Come on /u/BOMinvest"
Then why are you here

Who needs shame when u r rich as fuck?
I follow all cryptocurrency related subs.  This place has become a cesspool of butthurt.
Using misleading titles and dubiously timed screen shots does not help anyone. Your kink must be to beat dead horses. Which hey, if it is, go for it man. I'll just laugh while you do. Cheers and good will.
You seem emotional about protocols. Is that how you invest?
I just think that if BCH really wants to take off, its supporters should probably stop dissing every other crypto out there and focus on itself.  It's become a laughing stock.
I wasn't the one with a compliant, I don't feel as you do about the sub here, while I think it could improve in some ways, it's no where near as bad as some subs.
Same
I was just curious if you were helping to make it better or worse, I think that answers that.
"They are suffering from ""minion syndrome"", which is similar to being severely cognitively limited, terrible thing 😬"
LOL what...ok please tell me what I follow then since you know better than me and you think you're psychic.  Gee, I wonder why I would follow cryptocurrency subs if I am interested in the tech?  I have a custom multisub that I follow.  Fuck off, retard.
This dude is literally commenting and whining on every post I make. I am apparently a magnet for people with special needs 🤷‍♂️

What kind of special needs do you speak of? 
"> I follow all cryptocurrency related subs.

no you do not.

also why would anyone ever do that."
And what are you doing about it?
"LTC briefly overtook BCH and BSV in market cap. People laughing at Shitcoin wars - [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DuaKXhAXcAA401V.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DuaKXhAXcAA401V.jpg)

Here is Charlie Lee's original prediction [https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/967804050765828102](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/967804050765828102) that he got right back in   25 Feb 2018 ."
"It is risky...

If you don't want to click, it is a video of a man stuffing chickens down his pants before running down the street shouting ""Its Happening! Its Happening!"""
I would never buy ltc, it’s a pointless coin
So no source to actual tweet
🍪?
litecoin or his doodle?
At this rate, everything will be worthless. 
"http://flappening.watch/

What a pathetic community. BCHABC/BCHSV have no futures "
Not really. Whether he sold all his ltc or not isn’t very relevant

Hahahaha 
"You can't say ""Charlie"" without saying ""lie""."
Owned. :)
Haha 
😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

LOL
He probably bought some back and wants to pump it.

Wow, what do you say after that one. Brutal,
The flappening is real! 
someone getting worried about the flappening?
How old is this tweet? Wasn't recent, that's for sure. Come on /u/egon_1. 
But what about the Litecoin?
Flap flap.
Charlie has no shame.
"LTC attacks come out when the flappening draws near. The hurt is real in this sub. 

http://flappening.watch/"
