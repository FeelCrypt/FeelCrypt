You're making a much-needed point, but it shouldn't be swept under the rug that this sub is the way it is because of the incredible polarization caused by the massive censorship campaign on the other sub. The question is how to improve this sub while not failing to warn people about the full extent of the debate manipulation and its astonishing, lasting effects on the ecosystem.
One of the worst thing about this sub is all the people that feel the need to come here and post how shitty it is.  Who cares, go elsewhere, or downvote and move on.

You're totally right. Unfortunately, you are in the minority of people who think bigger and are able to put pettiness aside. Trying to change things is basically useless. I've found a more effective use of time is to actually learn about the technology and build things. The people who argue here aren't technologists.
"That or the banksters piled in in an effort to delegitimise the real ubiquitous Bitcoin as originally designed... It certainly wasn't the laughable technical ""upgrade"" known as Segwit that drove the price everyone can be certain of that

Basically, all that medium post proved: some old school Bitcoiners that align with Bitcoin Core chat about what’s happening in Bitcoin in a private chat group.

So for the rest of your life you are going to talk about how you had to move here from /r/bitcoin because how bad it is there? Or are you going to start your own independent identity? Imagine if people in America nowadays still keep talking about how bad England was and how they had to move here. They are not, America is now a country of its own with its own structure, identity and politics. Hope /r/btc can do the same and in the future not even think anymore about /r/bitcoin or at least just say 'we have differences in opinion' and leave it like that instead of getting in this politically charged mess of opinions that keeps coming back over and over and over again which are not leading anywhere imo.
Yes, we get it. It is censored and it is a fact. Can we move on now and have more conversations on how to improve this subreddit or are we just going to talk about how they are worse? 
Of course, but I think everyone realizes that both subs aren't perfect and there's no need to come here to shit on us.

"Edit: They can't Audit the Federal Reserve, what makes you think someone can Audit Tether 😂😂😂 /s

TL;DR: You're correct, no real audit of any level has been publicly release of Tether's finances. More I read, the more the evidence indicates Tether is just printing Crypto. 

Pretty incredible when you consider that Bitcoin was founded on untrusted miners proving security of coins! 


 

I honestly haven't tracked Tether closely. I remember reading about audits back in September, but this is all that I can find. They claim to have audited 2016/12/31 to 2017-03-31, which isn't the time period in question. 

They promise an audit by a US based CPA, but no promised due date. That was ~70 days ago. A high level audit should have already completed. It really shouldn't be hard to confirm they have $X million in a bank account. Sure, a first full audit will take some time, but the Tether Blockchain will have the list of liabilities and it shouldn't be too hard to confirm how much cash they have on hand. 

https://tether.to/tether-update/

Auditors

We are aware of online discussions about Tether’s lack of publicly-available audits. Periodic audits of our bank balances have been performed by the Taiwan-based auditing firm TOPSUN CPAs & Co. The results of those audits were for the benefit of shareholders and were not in a form suitable for public consumption (to begin with, they were in Mandarin). Nonetheless, we have asked them to prepare the following attestations (PDFs linked) in English, for release to the community, covering December 31, 2016; January 31,2017; February 28, 2017; and, March 31, 2017. As we are no longer banking in Taiwan, and given that we are achieving substantial scale, we have engaged Friedman, LLP, in New York, to perform comprehensive balance sheet audits on a quarterly basis going back to Dec 31, 2016. We will share those results with you as they become available in the coming weeks or months.

"What gives you the right to call Roger and Craig frauds and liars? Perhaps they made some mistakes in their time but no-one is perfect. It's still a far cry from the shit that the Core team has pulled.

Look at Luke who is the first known person to mount a [51% attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yeo46/is_blockstreams_lukejr_the_only_person_to_ever/?st=j89pmlpc&sh=e315ce26) on another network.

Look at theymos who was [downvoted to oblivion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/?st=j95o3z6z&sh=259a60f8) by his own community for being a dictatorial piece of shit, and then proceeds to ramp up that censorship across [multiple platforms to sabotage other projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3z0pkq/theymos_caught_redhanded_why_he_censors_all_the/?st=j95o4po9&sh=a7d30258). Also when he felt the need to [bully Coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/?st=j95odi59&sh=7c15b3cb) into supporting the Blockstream Coin, threatening major damage otherwise - notice the huge amount of downvotes that you just wouldn't see today, because the /r/bitcoin 'community' would support him fully.

Look at Greg Maxwell who obnoxiously uses his skills to [vandalise and deface Wikipedia entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=36639732#User:Gmaxwell) and has an entire section devoted to the Wikipedia admins discussing his behaviour. Also when he tried to remove Satoshi's name from every entry in Github and replace it with his own.

I could go on but I know it's lost on people who just don't give a shit how low these bastards stoop. If you support sitting back and letting this kind of behaviour happen, then you're a scummy human too and frankly I don't really wish to engage with anyone who sides with these criminals.

_____

As for this 'influx' of small blockers all over the internet - tell me where they are in real life? I don't see them at Bitcoin Meetups. I certainly don't know where they are. There are people who turn a blind eye due to profits, but that's the only reason people can give me for supporting them.

The 'scaling debate' is madness. There's a huge problem with blocks getting full and transaction fees getting high - to keep the adoption levels up you need to do something **now**! It's already been put off and delayed by months - years even. Instead, we have to wait for Segwit adoption which could take **months** and then Lightning Network which will take **months** if not years (probably the latter). We're told that a simple blocksize increase will ease up this congestion, allowing adoption to continue rapidly. More work needs to be done to scale but there's a problem that needs addressing right now, and Segwit isn't addressing it."
No? Why would I?
I disagree with lots of people here regarding Bitcoin Cash, and it does bother and about me to see so much discussion here dedicated to it, people calling it Bitcoin (or Satoshi's Bitcoin, etc.), or the CSW fanboys in general. However, I have never had a problem with my opinion being censored it having large numbers of people troll or personally attack me (those that do are usually trolls if this sub, not normal members). I can't say the same if the other sub. Because there is a huge network effect with this site, I generally have to use the larger communities to get any value out of Reddit. Given that, r/btc is my preferred Bitcoin community despite its flaws.
"What do you even mean by ""conflating your opinion of the sub with reality""?  Conflate means to join, or merge. Is there something wrong with an opinion being joined with reality?"

This post that actively goes against the status quo shows exactly how hard it is to go against the dominant view that is currently active in this subreddit... 
Yep I will actively take part of that. But the point of this post is to  (hopefully) provide a wake-up call for everybody
I **disagree** that it is a shitty sub, but I will agree that we are obsessed, mainly because the topic is so closely linked.
People like the topic more than his comments.
"I don't agree that because there may be some bad apples supporting Core that have a lot of power, the entire dev community should be replaced. It's a huge talent pool of devs and I honestly think we'd be fucked without them if a lot of them didn't jump over (which I have my doubts about). 

Sure block size increases are easy but I very much doubt we'd ever see Schnorr signatures or MAST implemented well under Jeff Garzik or Roger Ver's devteam. And IMO fungibility improvements at the base protocol should be one of the highest priorities. When you have things that can improve both fungibility and scaling without compromising nodes or putting small miners at further potential disadvantages - that should be what everyone focused on.

The NYA opposition is not only from people who think 2MB is too early but also from people who dislike a few powerful people being able to dictate protocol changes. 

Even though we disagree on a lot of fundamental details (especially including what is most important and what is not), it's still nice to see reasonable non-accusatory response. 

Time will tell if on-chain or off-chain scaling is the way to go and hopefully when S2X is over everything will settle down and people will focus more on building and promoting the projects they support than disrupting the ones the don't.

Well yes, I do agree that calling it censorship is a bit strong.
"> You barely post about bitcoin at all

My post history would suggest otherwise. Only an hour ago [I ran some stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78dagz/is_segwit_collapsing/dot64v1/) to check segwit usage in the BTC mempool and [posted the code](http://dumptext.com/7AxgS5KZ) I wrote to do it.

Yet, you think I ""barely post about bitcoin at all"". ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Do trolls normally go to the effort of running a full node, writing (and publishing) python code to verify arguments in reddit threads?"
And yet a large part of his comments are marked controversial.
"The Satoshi claim - Craig either **is** Satoshi but can't prove it (yeah, I don't believe it personally, but is it POSSIBLE? Sure), or he isn't and it caused a bit of a stir of drama. Hardly on-par with any of the stuff I've listed.

Misrepresentation and misinformation? That's the pot calling the kettle black to be totally honest. Theymos himself practically admitted to using those tactics to sabotage Classic and XT. Unless you have solid examples and not just some 'technicalities' or an infographic that can be interpreted differently visually based on your own biases then I can't agree with you on that claim.

Really, I know **one** person who doesn't go to meetups at all anyway, I know he's real but the only reason he supports small blocks is because he's convinced as soon as you increase them to 2MB it's going to ruin the network by making it too heavy. That's kinda all he has to say on it. Meetups where I am tend to have 50% of people who are really new and not informed enough, maybe 30% then who understand enough and don't care either way as long as it make them money, and the remaining 20% **seem** to lean on the side of 2X. Alright I've not manage to speak to and interview everyone one-on-one so I'll admit that's not a 100% consensus but I've not heard anyone say otherwise.

Segwit and LN - I believe - are not inherently completely shit pieces of tech. I worry about the fact that a company will be in charge of the LN, and that will be a centralised layer on top of the blockchain. I think it **could** be implemented correctly to keep the majority of your funds secure on the blockchain, but I admit I'm not technical enough to know the limitations of that. What I absolutely do not trust is the current team being in charge of that implementation. If you remove the current Core team, I would be happy to give Segwit its fair shot at being 'Bitcoin', but as is the case in the world of Crypto, whichever chain becomes redundant **legitimately** and not via vicious attacks and sabotage, then that's fair enough.

The 'blocksize increase' is hardly doing anything. The average has gone from 1MB to 1.03MB at the most. Adoption needs to happen faster. However I still think that instead of having the world upgrade their software to allow for a 0.7MB increase, we could just have a 1MB increase and let the worldwide Bitcoin adoption continue on its exponential growth trajectory. I don't want Bitcoin to stagnate, I absolutely love the technology and I think it's the future. Right now it seems to be being hindered so that a 2nd layer can be pushed and the Core team can take the glory for it, when we could just solve the issue right now."
"I see your point. But it's not *censorship*. It's creating a circle jerk with the same kind of opinions voted highly. Censorship is removing them completely. All you need to do is scroll down to see the comments.

I agree that it's not good, but I don't like the usage of the word censorship here. They are different things.

For example if I claim something (that is clearly false). In a censored content then you will see no responses and you assume that I am correct. In a circle jerk environment you will at least see comments saying I'm wrong despite them being heavily down voted."
"You barely post about bitcoin at all, the vast majority of your posts are making broad generalizations about ""you guys"" and insisting you're not trolling."
"Good. 

See, the thing is, a healthy subreddit should contain no posts like this one.

The very fact that your post appeared on my front page proves this subreddit is unhealthy, but also makes you part of the problem. It reminds me of [the famous Bedlam DL3 story](https://rodneymbliss.com/2013/10/17/i-survived-bedlam3/)."
Maybe there's a lot of angry individuals?
Your post is top of the sub now. 
"Half of those accusations has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol. Idgaf about wikipedia drama from 10 years ago or the owner of r/bitcoin being downvoted by the sub he is ""censoring"".

Do I really need to explain why Craig is a fraud? Hint: he lied about being Satoshi to get notoriety and profit off of the confusion. Looks to have been a great move for him and will continue to be so as long as there are people willing to work with him.

Roger is at the very least guilty of knowingly using wild misrepresentation/misinformation to promote what he feel is right (""firing"" Core).

It's hilarious that you say you don't see small blockers at meet ups, while literally the opposite is true. Look at conferences, meet ups, youtube channels and even willingly self-doxxed people on twitter. There is NO presence of NYA support at all. You have to seek it out on these subreddits.

You assert a lot of things in your last paragraph that I disagree with, although I'm happy to see you not go full retard ""segshit is malicious code and LN is centralized vaporware"". I think temporarily removing the feasibility of small transactions is a price well worth paying to avoid further centralization and splitting of the network. I'm not a ""1 meg forever"" guy, but I'm sure we'll see more consensus around a further blocksize increase when done in a more reasonable manner without obvious other, better solutions available. I'll remind you that we **just** had a block size increase that we are yet to see the full benefits from. The first time on-chain throughput capacity has increased in the history of Bitcoin (and it has never been higher).

We have SW, if you want lower fees start using it - it works great."
"Sorry, what I mean is that if all posts that criticize Bitcoin Cash are downvote do, and no one is sorting by controversial, then the effect is that they are not seen by anyone in reality.

Just so we are clear: /r/Bitcoin has terrible rules and mods, so I'm not defending them. Just that the initial guy has a point regarding Bitcoin Cash downvote brigade is a sort of censorship as well."
So even defending myself against all the accusations I get in here means I'm a troll? There's no winning with you people.
I can appreciate your perspective, but mine is a bit wider on the scope of the universe.  There are things that matter, but they will not come into focus for some time.  In the meantime, all we can do is call out the bullshit when we see it.

"It's not just about that Medium post, there's been eye-witness accounts of it BEFORE that slip-up happened, where 'whistleblowers' said exactly what went on in that room. Then we got to actually see a glimpse of it with our own eyes.

The fact that you try to have it brushed off as a 'conspiracy theory' makes me believe that you're just too naiive to think it **could** genuinely be happening, or you're part of the 'mitigation' team that's trying to get /r/btc to back down and just accept the attack being launched against it. It is, it's dangerous, and it's destroying the most amazing technological advancement of the last few decades.

It's so hard to tell if someone is genuinely a supporter of the Core team (which I just can't fathom why you would be given their track record of being absolute cunts*), or if they're paid trolls, or if they're just the old Buttcoin trolls who had to move somewhere because they got banned on /r/bitcoin - but that's because you're all hard to distinguish most of the time.

"You've got 447 upvotes here and you got deleted in r/bitcoin. I upvoted your post too. 

I've found r/btc community more friendly and more helpful, but I agree that there is more hostility here then I like."
"Facts:

Social media propagandists, Core developers, Blockstream founders and employees, and /r/Bitcoin moderators hang out in this private chat channel (dragonsden) on Core slack .

http://telegra.ph/Inside-the-Dragons-Den-Bitcoin-Cores-Troll-Army-04-07

Thanks to Bram Cohen for the reveal which confirmed what we long suspected about the collusion between r/Bitcoin mods, Core and Blockstreamers, and the coordination of propaganda against anyone on your 'enemies list'."
And somehow it's our fault that full-time trolls are being hired to shit all over this sub and even follow us to other subs on reddit? Downvote and move on instead of complaining. These kinds of posts only add even more noise.
Only one subreddit actively suppresses counter opinions. 
"Just in case you don't know, you should read this:

Why should I even care about your view. You seem (according to your measure) unimportant?
Nope. Give a rational answer.
Public discussion before removal in a new separate post? Karma court of sorts. It can work if enough people are willing to participate 
"I actually still think it's important to let newcomers know just how insanely censored r/bitcoin is, because most people never realize this.  It's censored to the point where you literally have to puppet their exact storyline or you get banned. 

But that said, I do see your point, there really does need to be more threads about actual discussion about the future of bitcoin from a more technical viewpoint here, there's definitely a lot of bandwagoning here much like there is at r/bitcoin, though at least there's less idiotic memes.  "
Yeah. I agree with this whole heatedly. Both subs are shit. And both proved it with this post. 
"When satoshi wrote about ""1CPU = 1 vote"", he didn't specify that it only applies to general purpose CPUs."
In the long, or very long, run it will be. Sometimes it takes a long time for markets to adjust to facts on the ground when getting to them is so difficult. That's the whole point of Blockstream/Core's nonsense.
"Good points. 

I think we can agree the price rise wasn't due to the technical benefits of SegWit. 

I'd prefer to think the reduction in FUD drove the price more than Tethers, but I honestly don't know. 

I remember reading about a Tether Audit that looked good, I'm guessing it didn't cover that time period? "
Moving the goalposts. Satoshi himself also said he had not anticipated the asic mining pools. 
"Fact:

Assumptions don't hold up in court. None of what you said were proven by the screenshots."
"That response sure was predictable, although it is the first time I hear ""Core mitigation team"", would make for a cool flair. Great use of the word whistleblower btw.

I can say the exact same thing about not being able to fathom why anyone would support obvious liars/frauds like Roger and Craig Wright. However, I'm not very inclined to believe in conspiracies and wishful thinking, so instead of doing so I actually consider that there could be real people that disagree with me. You should try it.

The buttcoiner accusation makes little sense to me. That label would be more fitting for someone who sold their Bitcoin for altcoins. I'm a big believer in Bitcoin and as it looks to shrug off the attempt from a small group of CEOs to take over development, my belief in it as long term censorship resistant network only increases.

Keeping it on a subject you seem to enjoy, I have a little conspiracy theory of my own: 

The influx of “small blockers” that have been seen on r/btc and other social media sites leading up to the 2X hf, are real people with a lot of skin in the game, strongly incentivized to do what they feel is protecting that.

If you concede to believing that it could be possible to prefer a cautious approach to scaling/consensus layer changes, then suddenly it makes sense that people who are heavily invested will be self-motivated to voice their opinion. No “Blockstream Core” shilling fee necessary."
Do you actually sort by controversial? May I ask why?
It's an established term that predates that cesspit by several years.
"Yeah well, this sub does a lot of conspiracy. I read  ""crooked"" and other t_d vocabulary regularly "
I like it how you brush off the censorship like it's nothing.
"Is there some master resource for ""what is going on here""? Something that details the history?"
It doesnt matter what you care about.
"*Let's fight fire with more antagonistic fire. I lke it.* My god.

How about the OP who posted this in what we thought was good nature. I like the approach that the internet as a whole is a clusterfuck of toxicity. This sub and the other sub are minor as to the things you can read on the internets.  

I like how the OP also brushes off the censorship as it's not a big deal. It's a huge fucking deal mate. What use is structured argument when you can't be heard or seen?

Maybe you shouldn't be here if you can't handle it. I tend to brush this stuff aside in my personal life and it shouldn't be any different reading a subreddit.. #triggered"
There might not be one solution. But the first step is admitting this subreddit needs to have its own identity and future that is not correlated with everything that /r/bitcoin does. I would like to see more positivity and not all this politically charged debates that are happening based on differences in ideologies (which seem to go nowhere). Even better is if you just support their goals even if you dont agree with them as we are all trying to transform the world to use blockchain technology and there is plenty of room for everybody.
It should be about Bitcoin (Cash) and its future for society... not Twitter posts about a person saying how your technology is superior to Bitcoin core's technology or how you can speak so freely here but at that other subreddit, they keep censoring you. After the fork, you are now two completely different technologies that should have their own aim and philosophy. All this focus on attacking each other should be used more productively in my opinion. 
People dislike this sub for all the talk about how the other sub censors 
Please create a sub then. I will join you and advertise it. I'm looking for a sub like this.
Free, efficient markets require the free flow of information. I don't think this is petty at all.
"This sub is BTC not BCC/BCH it is a sub about bitcoin.

The difference is this sub doesn't force narratives or push viewpoints by force. So bch found a home here.

At least you are able to post this here...

So True! Upvote! 
"We're small, but growing, over at r/BitcoinDiscussion

We moderate tone but not opinions. So it stays friendly, but no one gets censored, no character assassination, etc. 

It's also for serious indepth material, so you'll have to get your memes and price speculation threads elsewhere.

I hope you give us a look! "
"Thank you /u/Blockchainsapiens . I agree this sub is just as circle-jerky as /r/bitcoin, even if the other sub censors more. I would hope that the Nov fork would chill things out....but I have a feeling that it's just going to be calm until the next hardfork :(

I'll actively try to downvote toxicity, but I'm not on this sub enough to really make a difference by myself"
"I always lol at the censoring comments and think ""if it's this kind of vitriol they are censoring then I understand why"".

I agree with you OP. These subs are the worst part of bitcoin."
"This sub is generally awful to read but I do have to agree that the other one takes moderation way too far to the point I cannot trust its content (I totally agree with moderation but many many good posts are removed without just cause). 

There are a lot of genuinely intelligent and good users here unfortunately vastly eclipsed by those parroting facts they don't or refuse to understand as well as those who just want to rub it in BCH user faces for some reason.

I read through both, help the newbs and try not to dispair."
"This is the problem with most ""alternative"" subreddits. They always become about the other subreddit and not about the topic itself. /r/uncensorednews spends too much time discussing /r/news instead of actual uncensored news. Similarly, /r/btc spends too much time discussing /r/Bitcoin. These discussions are off-topic, and frankly, so is this one."
Don't try to drag r/Bitcoin down with you. Overall, it's stupid to always talk about r/Bitcoin here in r/Btc.
"Very well said. I must say it is getting annoying. I would much rather find news and info than another God damn post about how something got censored.

It is not just r/Bitcoin either. It's all over reddit. People censor shit a lot now. Each subreddit has its own reasons. I love this place for not censoring, and wouldn't want it any other way, but it would be nice to see it be more than a circle jerk."
I wish we could all just focus on the Lightning Network, which will potentially end the scaling debate in a satisfactory way for both sides and give us the One True Coin.

Oh no.  Somebody censored something on reddit.  Blame the blockchain.
LMFAO
Is there any proof that it was posted? How would I find out that /r/bitcoin mods actually deleted it?
I don't read all the posts about how bad the other sub is.  Sometimes I vote those posts down.  I find enough posts are constructive to stick around.
I agree that the back and forth stuff has been bad, but this side seems to actually be open to honest debate. I have been reading both for awhile now, and I consistently find a much more open discussion here. r/bitcoin has devolved into name calling, memes and groupthink. I can see why you might compare both, but I think you're really missing a critical piece, which is open debate is healthy, even if some people say mean things. This sub's got it, and the other just doesn't.
Seems like r/bitcoin is the most terrible sub.
The irony.
">The point is WHO CARES

that, is, the whole point.

New people come to learn about Bitcoin, they find information which is wrong (censorsed) and they believe this is true. They then spend months trying to understand this false image and often fail to understand Bitcoin at all due to it.

The censorship has a real effect and it is very bad for the overall goal of btc"

Yeah, /r/Bitcoin is a censored echo chamber and /r/btc needs to be renamed /r/bch because this sub seems to have little to do with Bitcoin .

This subreddit only bad at the moment because it's being heavily astroturfed and brigaded by BlockStream/Core/Dragons Den shills. If you use RES you can tag them and see who the troublemakers are each thread.
Wow, don’t even know how to respond.  If you haven’t noticed we both have Bitcoin in the name and ultimately there can only be one Bitcoin.  It IS a competition and considering all the mis-information and truth censorship on the other thread, I think it’s our job to set new user’s straight.  I agree, some of us may take it a bit too far on occasion, but you have to realize we are constantly bombarded by trolls on this board, which we do not censor...  meanwhile we can’t even make a post on the other board...  My point is, I’m sorry you feel this way, but I think this board is just fine.  It’s part of the reason I was able to learn what segwit and the LN was really about and shift my focus more toward Bitcoin Cash.

r/CryptoCurrency is vying for inclusion here.
If r/btc is shit right now, that is 100% due to the DDTs that have been going around spreading misinformation and brigading. The people here who are not Dragon's Den Trolls have very good conversation. We are simply being bombarded by trolls.
"Preaching to the void, but I agree with you. I left Bitcoin (for Ethereum, but then left Crypto for personal reasons) because of the political instability, the fact that a hard fork had to be made was a bit of a bummer, but I haven't seen any of the communities take it seriously afterwards. I want to see discussions about innovation and promotion of the coin, not just shit talking about the opposition like if they were ballot opponents. I want to see BCC grow and become a force to be reckoned with, but it's not going to happen if the whole argument is ""we're not those Blockstream shitheads""."

On the other hand, /r/bitcoin has never been worse... And is continuing in the downward spiral.

The future is bright, and as /r/bitcoin continues to do what it does, /r/btc will only be better and better."
Yeah, we’re here on Reddit to attract new investors. Lol what is this post?
"It's unfortunate that r/btc as a counterpoint from the censorship of r/bitcoin became obsessed possibly defined by pointing that out.

"Yup, its disappointing that all the Bitcoin communities suck so bad.

Weaponized PR on both sides.
"Why keep complaining about another sub when you can post here?.. If it's a sign of anything it's that you're trolling. Proving you don't have the right to troll another sub doesn't give me any sympathy for your message.

You got your own reddit r/btc where trolling is accepted, got your own tickers (two of them!) BCC/BCH  

You got your own policies regarding topics of interest: _Complaining about everything_, BCC/BCH/GOLD/B2X/Bitcoin.

You need your own place for this kind of chaos and it doesn't fit on the other sub which tries to not concern itself too much with forks."
I don't agree with your attempted characterization at all.  /r/btc identity is definitely tied to bitcoin, why would you try to confuse people about that?  Crypto isn't about subreddits.  It's about the tokens.  This is just where people talk. The subs aren't themselves coins, they are forums, we're supposed to duke things out here. Why would you propose everyone stop?  Subs don't have to attract investors. The *coin* attracts investors. The design of the coins, performance, adoption, its principles, these things change mindsets. Discussion on reddit has never been pretty - the bigger the group, the messier.  It is most certainly is, always, a competition.

"This relativisation... Yawn ... As if saying bad things about two opposing parts all of the suddenly makes up a valid point. People think they are above both parts when saying such things.

You're not wise because if telling people to grow up. Why would anyone take your advice? How would they know if it's not you that need to grow up?

The criticism is very much valid, but the comparison is both pretentious abd childish.

And then on top saying that pointing out censoring ""is not the point""... Dude... What do you want? Are you aware this is discussion website? Or did you post so you get a kick out of people potentially saying your are the man and praising your post?"
Upvoted because you're right.
"In broad strokes, I agree with you. But if you look at this in critical light, you'll see that the amount of badmouthing here is *a lot more prominent* than on r-bitcoin. By far and large, the posters on r-bitcoin are very happy about what they have - A great coin and a commonly shared view on the scaling, and a team of devs

I also asked more than once here, why are people so hell bent on shitting on bitcoin instead of focusing on the developments and enhancements of Bitcoin Cash. Every time, I get strongly down voted. And no answer to the question I posed.

I am firmly behind the Core approach, but I also understand people have different views. That's the beauty of open source software and a free society, you can go your own way. But after you do, you lose all the benefits of being in a peer group. That's not being malicious, that's life. America renounced the British rule, and went on to do pretty well. But that doesn't mean America gets to keep the British benefits, real or not. You go on your own, you carve yourself a new path.

May the best coin win."
Wait a little bit. Soon we will have more Bitcoin-Blockchains then subreddits.
"there is a new bitcoin subreddit in town. .

/r/bitcoin21

"This is true. They’re filled with marketers from BTC exchanges and speculators. It’s kind of annoying. No one is allowed to point out flaws with BTC, because there are many. 

No one is allowed to point out that the BTC economy, and the price swing has made it lose its utility because of scaling. On blockchain.info, anyone can see that the number of transaction in BTC have not changed in volume over the last year. But if someone pointed that out, it might cause panic for the speculators... "
"Hah! I've been lurking in both for over a year (there's a third too), and just gave up trying to learn bitcoin. I'm not super PC savvy, and struggled even after months of googling and a couple of documentaries.

The biggest problem though, is everyone playing their own trumpet, and saying how it's vastly superior. It's an arrogance I've recognised many times in failing situations. I'm glad it worked out asked nd is still strong, but the community linked to it, are elitist and condescending.

Also, it would be amazing if it wasn't so complex, why isn't there just a quick way to do it all? Like buying foreign currency. Give me an app that does all the grunt work, and I'm in, but needing several apps, 2 devices that use certain OS, several passwords, trying to buy bitcoin almost gave me a stroke."

Anyone with any common sense should care about this. I think this sub goes over the top with “censored on rbitcoin” type posts sometimes. And I think that your post isn’t all that worthwhile. But the fact that a lot of dissenting opinions on rbitcoin are removed by the mods (or even auto-modded away for containing dangerous words) is a very relevant thing to bring to the attention of anyone who reads both subs."

Did you manage to solve “downvote censoring” and “echo chambering”? People with different opinions can get constantly discouraged from posting and eventually abandon the sub, leaving an extremely one sided sub population. Which then proceeds to again downvote any newcomer with different ideas.
It's not that hard if you put your trust in some businesses/banks which most people here don't. If you don't use your Bitcoin for gambling, coinbase is your go to place, if you can manage to have a wallet ( an app in your phone is enough ) and buy from another place like cex.io, then you can do what you want with your Bitcoin.  If you are not holding millions, no need for overly complicated security. You can go for ease of use.

/r/BitcoinMarkets their arguments are economic and they put their money where their mouth is

I disagree, /r/bitcoin attacks the /r/btc relentlessly, let's not forget that over 70,000 people started in /r/bitcoin and have migrated to /r/btc for similar reasons.
Especially if you're in a minority. You're just treated like you're out to cause trouble. Anything that goes against the current wave if sentiment or group think is considered trolling. 
Well said
bitcoin on reddit was much more fun when we were all anti-bank instead of all this unceasing internecine feuding
"I’m really hoping that with the banwaves of 2X supporters on /r/bitcoin, more will be driven here and give this subreddit more diverse opinions. The crux of the issue was that people who didn’t agree with core were driven here after being banned from the other subreddit, making this a reverse echo chamber where most other opinions would get downvoted.

That’s definitely better than outright censorship, but it’s still extremely unwelcoming to newbies who are just looking for information and want to get involved. A wider array of opinions will (hopefully) overshadow trolls looking to stir things up and instead give this subreddit more real genuine discussion and make it a more positive place, which is something the bitcoin space needs badly right now."

Agree wholeheartedly.  We've got a new(ish) community over at r/BitcoinDiscussion that tries to address all these points.  Traffic is still a bit slow, but we're growing, and the signal/noise ratio is excellent.  I hope you give us a look!

Well, it's easy for trolls on /r/bitcoin to come here and do their best to make /r/btc a shitty place.  I've recently witnessed an increase of pro-Core trolls upvoting dumb comments and downvoting comments of good quality.  But once you know how to quickly spot them and ignore them, /r/btc holds the most interesting discussions overall.  I haven't seen in ages a good technical post with insighful comments on /r/bitcoin.  Probably because every competent users are now banned of /r/bitcoin.
Sometimes hostility is warranted and deserved.
They aren't. They're saying that censorship shouldn't be your identity. It should be a given while you talk about interesting subjects that will attract new users.

This subreddit would be much better if it wasn't brigaded by Block(the)Stream/Core trolls and shills all the time. It has definitely ramped up in the last month. /r/bitcoin would be much better if it wasn't censored. At least /r/btc is not censored. Everyone is free to have their say here. Unfortunately that means there's a lot of muppets having their say, but you can tag the repeat offenders with RES, downvote when you see them and move on. Eventually they get downvoted so much that Reddit ratelimits their posts.
"Making this sub better has to start with calling out people who resort to childish stuff and stop stigmatizing contentious opinions as trolls. I have no idea how to make it happen other than through moderation though, which I think, as long as it is transparent and only meant to kill a thread of discussion (a moderator quotes the removed message before removing it), is beneficial.

When your only choices are between shit and vomit, and you somehow justify choosing vomit because it's better, that's when you know your view is skewed. 
So let them do what they want to do. Lets just focus on us. Look at Tesla how much hate it got from all car companies, they (almost) never attacked other companies and just focussed on their tech and believed in their vision. Look where they are now, they are the future within the car industry, not the car companies that were attacking them continuously. I also personally think that attacking somebody else like this is a sign of weakness and insecurity.

Sorry, just noticed this. Why not?
"> Are you talking about a malicious mining majority?

Yes. The thing is that even if one entity has majority hashrate, they might choose to not attack because of attack being impractical in these days (too many people running full nodes). However, in theoretical scenario, when victim doesn't run full node, printing money is easier form of attack. Simply because for double spend attack one has to have some money in Bitcoin already (the money which drop in value in case of such attack). In case of money printing attack, that entity needs only miners + electricity.

> The basic value proposition is sound money: money that combines the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.

If this was the case, there would be no mining. The properties you describe can be achieved with central authority signing transactions (possibly in auditable manner). Since there is mining in Bitcoin, the value proposition must be something that makes mining required. And the only such thing is resistance against central control.

> Imposing an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a form of self-censorship and directly undermines Bitcoin's value proposition.

If you really believe so, go create another altcoin and we'll see which one wins.

> No, you just need a client that's configured to track that chain.

How does the client do that on technical level without validating blocks?

> For example, the LN suffers from what I call ""fractional-teller banking"" problem described in detail here.

This is a very good point and I consider it somewhat concerning too. Let's calculate:

* waiting time for unilateral closing of channel: 2 weeks
* block size 2MB (SegWit)
* average 2oo2 transaction size: 500B (pessimistic guess)

How many channels can be open so that all the channels can close in time?

2 weeks * 1 block / 10 min * 2MB / 500B == 8064000

So the current blockchain can safely handle ~8 million channels.

Do we need to increase the block size? Yes - we need to fit more channels into the blockchain. Do we need to do it right now? No - 8 million channels will take time to be created. If people use longer waiting time, we can fit much more.

> You absolutely lose something by mining invalid blocks with valid PoW -- the block rewards and fees you could have collected if you'd devoted that hash power to mining valid blocks.

Of course! That's why it's uneconomical for mining majority to attack anything lower than ~13 BTC (or more, if one assumes more confirmations). There's still a difference between being able to inflate and not being ablo to inflate, though."
"Miners don't need to mine invalid block in order to attack, but if they choose to attack it's easier for them to attack if they can mine invalid blocks.

The basic value proposition isn't cheap transactions. It's inability for governments to control the network. The only reason we spend huge amount of resources on mining is that we have to protect ourselves against governments.

> If you want to receive funds on one chain post-fork, that also doesn't require running a ""full node"" for that chain.

This is incorrect. It's absolutely necessary to run full node because otherwise you can't distinguish between the forks. Otherwise you'd have to trust the sender, which is exactly what Bitcoin was **not** designed for.

> They are banking, not ""scaling.""

Why do you think so? They are as trustless as Bitcoin is. What's different according to you?

> Any systemic breach of Bitcoin's money properties by a misbehaving hash power majority is going to be communicated by the market when the price craters.

You are correct. There is a difference, however: in order to perform double spend attack, miners must have some bitcoins already - the very bitcoins that will lose value after attack. However, if they can mine blocks creating bitcoins out of thin air, they don't have to have any bitcoins and ultimately don't lose anything. (Besides ASICs becoming worthless.)"
"The number of needed confirmations is a sliding scale. Exchanges have KYC they can function with 0 confirmations. 

getting hung up on the number of confirmations is overlooking the point I was making and that is, if it's not on the blockchain it's not a bitcoin transaction. "
"> Miners don't need to mine invalid block in order to attack, but if they choose to attack it's easier for them to attack if they can mine invalid blocks.

Are you talking about a malicious mining majority? Because in that case a valid blocks only attack is easier as there's no defense against it.  And if you're talking about a minority hash rate attacker, the question of which kind of attack is ""easier"" to pull off is immaterial. Users can simply wait for additional confirmations as appropriate based on the size and nature of a particular transaction.  

>The basic value proposition isn't cheap transactions. It's inability for governments to control the network. The only reason we spend huge amount of resources on mining is that we have to protect ourselves against governments.

The basic value proposition is sound money: money that combines the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.  The inability of governments to control the network (through arbitrary money printing or censoring transactions) is baked into that value proposition.  Imposing an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a form of self-censorship and directly undermines Bitcoin's value proposition.

>This is incorrect. It's absolutely necessary to run full node because otherwise you can't distinguish between the forks. Otherwise you'd have to trust the sender, which is exactly what Bitcoin was not designed for.

No, you just need a client that's configured to track that chain.  There's no sudden need to download and validate everyone else's transactions.

>Why do you think so? They are as trustless as Bitcoin is. What's different according to you?

When you move transactions to a second layer, you have, by definition, added an additional layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.  For example, the LN suffers from what I call ""fractional-teller banking"" problem described in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/).

>There is a difference, however: in order to perform double spend attack, miners must have some bitcoins already - the very bitcoins that will lose value after attack. However, if they can mine blocks creating bitcoins out of thin air, they don't have to have any bitcoins and ultimately don't lose anything. (Besides ASICs becoming worthless.)

You absolutely lose something by mining invalid blocks with valid PoW -- the block rewards and fees you could have collected if you'd devoted that hash power to mining valid blocks. But any differences in the cost and feasibility of an invalid block attack vs. a pure double spending attack are things that you can account for simply by requiring additional confirmations before treating a transaction as final.

Why bother with lawsuits if one can prevent them in the first place?
Increasing the block size makes it less censorship resistant. 
Thank you sir!
"> LN does not increase the blockspace. We have had Segwit for a few months and the blocks are still full.

That's not a measure of blockspace. 1GB blocks will also be full.

[The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

What are you now talking about, there is no Sybil - each node validates on it's own if block is valid.

In Bitcoin even if 99999 nodes tell me to accept given block,
and even if it has 100 exahash of work on it,
still I will reject the block if in it miner just given to himself 100 Bitcoins.

And on SPV nodes, especially on BCash where everyone will have SPV and where mining is now 90% done by one entity - you might not notice, and the part that runs own nodes and notices is too small and is ignored.

Lighting Network is the cash because you do NOT publish details of each micro payment to entire world.

"> It's cash because you own your private keys. LN is not cash because it doesn't exist.

In LN you hold private key all the time, and funds are on it, just you agree to freeze the funds for a month.

Normally the other party of channel will unfreeze it at your request,  but in case he is rogue (or ""dies"") then you still hold your money in your account, and after the set time you can spend it. It never is under ownership of someone else, like happens with exchanges and web wallets.
 
> Do you have any evidence that the incentives are wrong? Because so far so good what you suggest never happened. 

It happened, that miners mined invalid blocks.

Fortunately, they realized that everyone else is rejecting them, so they had a choice to throw away thousands of USD and come back to main network, or to be a separate fork.

If it would be that most miners can do it on purpose, AND users are all on SPV and economical majority doesn't notice, they can do that successfully. 

> honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. 

This text is about something else, about making VALID blocks, but blocks that are doing block rewinding and double-spend therefore.

This text does not at all consider that miners might create INVALID blocks, not just to double-spend or rewind few blocks, but to grant themselves 1000 Bitcoins.  Or 10 Bitcoins EVERY BLOCK. 

We should never put miners in such total power position. If you want, then it's your problem, I'm staying on coin when we validate our own money."
"Community shorter for Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is *Bitcoin*. I""m sorry if Blockstream tricked you to think that their settlement system is a P2P ecash system while its not.

Well you think in short term. Let's increase blocksize x2 or x8. Or x100.

Not take into account how this ruins layer-1 and make everyone fully hostage of miners if they would be to start giving themselves BTC rewards just because they can.

You do that, while Bitcoin Core says: it's a long race, let's give SegWit another half-year, and then try Lighting Network.

And in Core in a year we'll have x10000 more transactions.
