Meh. 1 maybe issue. Thatâ€™s far from being riddled with bugs. Also this peas compared to mistakes other dev teams have made.
">  they are not going to strangle bitcoin to 1 mb forever afaik

That's _exactly_ what they've been doing for the past four years, you must be new to this. Circa 2013 there was a time when _all_ of them were big-blockers; Adam Back (yes, that guy) even suggested that we should increase blocksize to 2MB, then 4MB in 2 years, then wait. And then they moved the goalpost to ""we'll increase, just not now"", then to ""no contentious hard fork"", then to ""no hard forks"", then to ""we gotta stall until Lightning or our totally-not-moneygrabbing Sidechains take off"". We're tired of that, we're not taking that shit anymore. "
I only saw 2 reported cases... dooglas and 1 other... and they are not going to strangle bitcoin to 1 mb forever afaik.
"Having your node just fucking fail where it has been stable for the past six years, replicated by multiple people, is ""1 maybe issue""? 

>Also this peas compared to mistakes other dev teams have made

Other dev teams did not conspire to strangle bitcoin by limiting it to 1MB forever. "
I certainly hope so.
"> itâ€™s open source and anyone can contribute

That is patently false, anyone can _submit a pull request_, it doesn't mean it'll get merged. Exactly how many and who can contribute is also dependent on the people controlling the repo. 

>Iâ€™d also say the core team is pretty dang dedicated to bitcoin and development is going stronger than ever. 

Doing cosmetics to keep up the appearance of ""development"" while the most important issue of the day/year/3 years rot is not what I call ""pretty dang dedicated"". A responsible developer does not cripple _the_ most important feature of their software to create demand for another feature that _doesn't even work yet_. "
Whatâ€™s your point? Think Iâ€™m being a hypocrite? Go read through my conversation beginning to end then tell me again. 
I did say contribute not merge... segwit? LN? Core .15... all with hardly any issues and performance gains. All while every other dev team throws out glaring mistake after mistake. ðŸ¤”
"Doesnâ€™t matter if you dont think segwit or LN is a good idea. The fact remains they have been working diligently. 

Funny you bring up .15 having issues. Itâ€™s all BS. There is nothing specific Jeff could cite. This even gets exposed if you were to read the thread is rbtc which you linked!"

Maybe you should actually visit the repo once in a while.

">segwit

In case you haven't been reading this sub, we generally think segwit is cancer that should be expelled from bitcoin as it breaks the chain of signatures. If you ask us, it's _negative_ development. There are way better malleability ""fixes"" as long as one is not allergic to hard forks. 

>LN

LN remains vaporware right now due to routing problems severely limiting its size while remaining decentralized. And even if it overcomes that, it remains to be seen how decentralized it can end up - chances are good that it doesn't. Probably still positive by itself, but limiting blocksize to create artificial demand for something that's way far from working is _negative_. 

>Core .15

>hardly any issues

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78yqia/psa_if_youre_running_bitcoin_core_015x_you_should/"
I read somewhere that Bitcoin Cash could scale up to 32 MB without having to hardfork. Maybe 8 MB is the default maxblocksize, but can be raised if needed? Same as Bitcoin Core's default maxblocksize is 750 KB but can be set up to 1 MB.
"> but itâ€™s open source after all 

It's a common misconception that ""open source"" = quality; it does not. ""Open source"" merely means two things (the latter one implied and not even strictly required, unless it's ""free software""):

1. That the source code is open for anyone to examine and study. 

2. That anyone can fork and distribute the code. 

1) has the obvious benefit of letting users be sure about details of the code they're running, and that the devs can't bamboozle you into running malicious code, but at the end of the day **the quality of the person(s) controlling the repo dictates quality of the software**. Open source projects fail all the time due to shit leads who impose unwise directions on projects, it's not news and has happened countless times.

2) is, therefore, the answer: When a piece of software is going in the direction you don't like, you fork away from it and abandon the old. And this is exactly what we're doing here. 

Assuming ""open source means you always end up with the best software"" is just ignorance to the entire history of the FOSS movement. "
Awesome, thank you :D.

Yea the argument is really tiring. I secretly hope x2 passes and core changes their codebase to 2mb.. continuing to work on bitcoin. I do NOT want garzik in control whatsoever but that really shouldnâ€™t matter as long as core changes to x2. Sounds like heâ€™s more interested in his alt coin anyway. Btw arenâ€™t BCH supporters afraid of x2 passing? That would make a close to equivalent 8mb max blocksize which would defeat most of the reason BCH was created. Letâ€™s be honest here. Segwit does not compromise security or anything to terrible. If there are some trade offs I would think the pros def out weigh the cons.
"32MB is the biggest value that the variable type used can handle; 8MB is the biggest block the current code will accept as valid. Changing the block size limit all the way up to 32MB is just a matter of changing a number in the code, going past 32MB requires also changing variable types; both require hardfork, but going past 32MB requires a little bit more changes to the code and might require additional testing to ensure there are no parts of the code that isn't prepared to handle the new variable type."
I donâ€™t think so. Unless they implement segwit or something similar. I donâ€™t think they are afraid to hard fork regardless. There is like 1 miner with exception to when the EDA kicks in. The one miner can fork BCH whenever he wants. 
Not their plan apparently. 
">decentralized miners

Eh wot? Miners are about as centralized as LN hubs would be. As in, as long as you have several million dollars you too can become a miner or LN hub. Nothing about Bitcoin is decentralized anymore."
Iâ€™m not disagreeing but what I meant was itâ€™s open source and anyone can contribute. There are thousands of eyes looking at this codebase all the time. Iâ€™d also say the core team is pretty dang dedicated to bitcoin and development is going stronger than ever. 
Bitcoin stock?....
I should've been more specific, I'm talking about Bitcoin Cash.
This is so stupid i dont even
Thanks. This is my new desktop background.
The plan is to increase the block size before hitting the limit becomes commonplace.
They will always become banker puppets. Good Things Don't Happen. Ever.

"> That would make a close to equivalent 8mb max blocksize

Gosh, so you fell for the ""segwit is 4MB"" meme. You realize it only applies to the fanciest of multisigs, where the bulk of tx are signatures, right? For your usual 1-in-2-out tx, it's more like 1.7MB. 

>Btw arenâ€™t BCH supporters afraid of x2 passing?

Many, like me, are okay with either x2 or BCH ""winning"", with a slight preference to BCH. As long as we get rid of the cancer of the Core repo keyholders - I do _not_ want them working here, and hope they lose their shirts - I'm good. I won't even trust these guys to watch my dog, less a subversive global currency meant to upset world powers. 

>Segwit does not compromise security or anything to terrible

You realize the entire signature part can be tossed with a _soft fork_, right? Let's face it, it's an ugly hack whose only purpose is to keep the ""no hardforks ever"" narrative intact. We could've simply fixed the malleability with a hard fork and it'll be clean, but no, we have to get into this bullshit. 
"
So how is this working out? 
I see. But you still don't agree that that attitude will get you downvotes? I can say that it does.
Welp, if everyone foregoes the transaction fees, it wouldn't matter if we had 32mb blocks, they'll still be backlogs because non of the txs are getting placed in blocks. But shit, thats stupid as hell. If any tx is over 0.001/kb Its actually worth it. But you get my point
yep, when I was still solo mining, I'd pretty much always mine empty blocks. Who the fuck cares about another 0.025btc when you get 25. But hey! Everyone can now say I'm an asshole miner too. lol
