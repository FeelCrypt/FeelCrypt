5 cents is not cheap?
For the end user, no, definitely not. There is a magic price point for everything. It was $0.99 for singles when iTunes was still a relatively new service and it is $0.05 for bitcoin transactions.
So the fee should never be more than 5 cents?
"If they are paying 3 or 5 cents then they are not spam. It's been that way for 3 years. 

You know what else has been consistent for the last three years? The projected growth in tx volume which predicted we would be at just about the exact volume which we are at today. How can you continue to ignore this fact?"
Debate better.
Pretty sure Gavin is Satoshi.

How do you distinguish spam from poor/cheap people sending too low of a tx fee?
"The post says nothing about time frame that I can see.

FWIW, fees are no higher today than they have been during other times of peak usage:

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/"
Where in the linked post does he make that prediction?
"The obvious lie that this is ""just spam"" and not the natural tx volume growth that one should expect given the extrapolation of the previous volume leading up to this point in time. So have these ""spammers"" been cleverly increasing the amount of spam for the last 3 years just to build up to this point? "
Not sure I understand your reaction to wait until you are suffering from a problem before you considering doing anything about it.  It's clear that this problem was coming a long time ago and now here we are.  
You've been fooled into thinking that a 35k tx backlog is not a problem worth solving and that it doesn't make the bitcoin network unreliable in any significant way. Meanwhile, pool operators are having difficulty paying their miners with some recommending the use of altcoins as a more reliable alternative.
"Exactly my concern as well.  It could be that we are ""not the initial target audience"".  Assuming the profile of the average redditor is in a western country, we are already decently well integrated into the banking system.  It could be more likely that remittances in 3rd world countries are the initial killer app for bitcoin adoption."
a closer analogy is like counting money moved between your savings and checkings towards GDP.
"https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=7&show_header=true&scale=1

Note that the above chart is a log chart whereas your examples are linear charts.  By my eyeball, most of the charts that you linked appear to have linear growth.  (except for countries like Russia that are sort of hyperinflating on their own).

Still, I wasn't arguing that the trends for the alternative metrics weren't exponential, just that it is lower exponential than is expected given the transaction chart's curve.  That difference would be partially explained by the ""artificial"" transactions.  What we really care about is ""true"" adoption and ""true"" usage statistics.

Transactions that are the equivalent of moving cash between a checking and savings account shouldn't be counted.

"
What are you even arguing for? Free transactions?
"My worry is the bitcoin emperor has no clothes.

5000 nodes

10 mines

1 dev team

?how many real users"
"So the fact that this ""spam attack"" just so happens to be perfectly in line the with extrapolated growth in tx volume is just a coincidence, eh?"

"> That's actually kind of what we do.

I know, that's what I was getting at. It's eyewash statistics.

"
it's a valid transaction, but it amounts to noise if we're trying to discern the true adoption rate of bitcoin.
"It's getting kind of ridiculous I'm starting to move from the let's try to compromise phase to the we'd be better off without them phase. Seriously, Maxwell coin sucks balls. 

"
No, I am simply not delusional about pretending a spam attack deserves to get through, or that spam attacks should be cheaper.
Tx aren't processing any differently than last week, you just have to pay the current fee threshold.
Agreed. But that's not to say it should be invalid.
I think we can agree that sending bitcoin to yourself isn't an actual usage of bitcoin as currency though.  That is, as a medium of exchange.  You aren't exchanging anything.
Try it and see how long it takes.
Yet it was changed after a very brief period.  Also BTCC has been sympathetic to the small block crowd and full blocks would work to their disadvantage...
"> Don't think this is anything sinister. Sounds like when they updated core software they forgot default block size limit is 750,000 bits (732 kB) and didn't change the setting. Their recent blocks are larger.

They complain about safety of software like the world is going to end if something goes wrong and then let some default config slip into production?!?

Not plausible."
Yes, he scheduled the spam attack right on time.
No disrespect but the big miners set their bitcoind up meticulously, if BTCC was mining 729kB blocks they intended ~~it~~ to. 
"Not in the linked post. His Scalability Roadmap post on bitcoinfoundation.org has been curiously deleted.

Here is a reddit post about his proposed code change to 20MB blocks to be activated by March 2016 (code committed May 1, 2015): 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/34riua/hard_fork_allow_20mb_blocks_after_1_march_2016/"
Fees are same, largely because they're set to a default size in most wallets. Time to confirm transactions, though... :(
I don't understand the problem. Pay a high enough fee, get your tx confirmed.
If you can't afford to pay for something, you don't get that thing/service. Bitcoin isn't a fucking charity.
It would be a good thing.
"How many of those times were not admitted ""stress tests"" that were talked about in advance and after the spikes? There was one day, November 5th, where we actually hit the limit without any stress testing and had a backlog for about 24 hours. The reason for that was clear. The price doubled and volume likewise exploded."
"Also in May: Mike Hearn wrote a [detailed analysis](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-capacity-cliff-586d1bf7715e#.yeowy2vi8) on why we have to increase the blocksize, and fast. The amount of nonsensical """"fuck you Mike""'s from the other side was astounding at the time. "
"> I'm pretty sure Gavin is quite aware of what's going on.

As they say, [""Keep your friends close but your enemies closer.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfHJDLoGInM)"
Agree.  Civility should not be confused with naivete.  True leaders don't engage in public pissing matches on the internet.

"- Transaction rates in bitcoin have been increasing over time.
- Last year Gavin started talking about how we needed to start writing up a solution and deploying it, because, around March 2016, the blocks would start hitting 1MB.
- Turns out that pretty much happened on schedule."
Speaking of reality distortion, with BTCC mining 729kB blocks it pulls the average block size below full.  
who gives a shit?
If you are poor then your lowly, pitiful transactions are just spam, right? Is that what you think?
You should look at the mempool tx counts broken down by fee/byte. Yes, there's spam (1-20 satoshi/byte), but the non-spam (>=31 satoshi/byte) is enough to fill up the blocks. Look at the colored bars here: http://bitcoinfees.21.co/
"Well, yes.  But what do you mean end up like Hearn?  Mike is a successful and reputable engineer, probably making good money doing what he likes. Do you think bitcoin at him back? 
I love bitcoin and what it could potentially achieve,  but I would throw away all my bitcoins to the last satoshi,  to be at where Mike is professionaly."
"Bingo! Thank you, glad I asked! Have a beer on me. /u/changetip private
"
I'm pretty sure Gavin is quite aware of what's going on. IMHO he's the opposite of naive. In his position he has to be quite careful just not to end up like hearn, etc. 
It would explain a lot.
"Sorry, I was wrong here. Others explained to me that it's a MEDIAN chart on confirmation times. And with median, as long as more than 50% are directly confirmed in the next block, nothing will change in the median statistic. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wmyc0/blockchaininfo_median_transaction_confirmation/

The chart at https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/confirmationtime-btc-sma7.html clearly is average time between blocks, not the average confirmation times."
";) won't be collecting this, because looks like I was wrong - chart is not average, but ""median transaction confirmation time""(!!!). But thanks.  TIL: 

> If 49% of transactions are being delayed by 100 hours, and 51% of transactions make it into the next block with no delay, then the median shows no delay."
most likely the former. miners will change their minds.
"I would call this an example of an artificial transaction

https://twitter.com/DataTranslator/status/704579281507258368

(or rather series of transactions)"
"> I don't understand the problem.

try harder"
Bitcoin transactions are supposed to be cheap and fast. I guess you never heard this before, correct?
"> This chart does show average time between blocks, not the average confirmation time.

Can you please back up this claim? Is there a description by blockchain.info on how exactly they arrive at the value? I need that for another thread where this chart is used and noone objects."
Civility should also not be confused with honesty. It's okay to show your passion occasionally.
Enjoy your little hug box. http://archive.is/PKZUm
"Just upvote all the threads that show people complaining about delayed confirmations.  

Make the whole front page full of them.  

It's just not right that this problem is being hidden.  I don't get why they're doing this. "
