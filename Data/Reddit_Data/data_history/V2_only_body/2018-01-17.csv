I cant tell if some of these exchanges are shady or incompetent or just completely overrun with the growth and dont have the staff to keep up. It took FOREVER to get my money out of Kraken. They dont mention in their tier statements that US residents have a 50k withdraw limit at tier 3 and 100k at tier 4. Had to get both my wife and i verified up so we could get most of our money out, and even then like 2/3 of the wire transfers failed for one reason or another. Just had to keep doing them till they went through. Their site seems to be running much more smoothly since their upgrade last week.
No. All of them are in my personal wallets. No exchanges.

Money claim online limit in 100k but it’s just a process, small claims court is 10k limit. The problem being that the court process you end up in is different and more costly. E.g. if it transpires that the claim is vexatious and the company were operating in the terms of their contract, then the claimant would be liable for significantly higher costs.
My bad, I didn't see that he sold his BTC, so yeah it could have been much less. If that is the case I take it back.

The post said ""How many problematic 30k wire transfers do they have to deal with?"". That is a good question. What is the answer? Maybe they have more 300k wires to deal with than 30k wires. Their daily trading volume is about $175M at current prices, so 30k is fairly small beer for that platform. If they had 50, 100k wires to deal with, a 30k wire would be at the bottom of the stack."

When you say your bank rejected the credit, do you mean your bank could not confirm (however they do it) that the funds were legitimate? I.e. the incoming wire (or faster payment, or whatever) was judged to be fraudulent in some way?
Sorry to hear you are having problems. Back when Kraken had problems with wires I got caught up for 6 weeks before the whole thing was cancelled and the money was returned. I didn't get entirely stonewalled but comms was not great at times. This was fiat going into the exchange, not as much as you but a decent wedge. While CEX.io customer service sounds appalling (honestly, what exchanges are not crap?!), I'm gonna guess that, *eventually*, things will work out. If their TCs say 60 days (which is fcuking useless), then I doubt they are going to do anything unless they have to - especially if they're totally bogged down, as is almost certainly the case. Best of luck.
This is a good point but its hard to speculate on what they are dealing with. $34k sounds a lot but compared with many peoples holdings, it is pretty small beer. I am not defending them at all - they sound fcuking awful - but incompetence in this space is massive.

I don't know why you're getting down voted, that's BS. I think your comments are spot on. Although I've not dealt with CEX, I've run into kind of similar issues elsewhere (perhaps not as bad) but I think in general as cypto enthusiasts and traders, we have to accept that most exchanges are terrible: understaffed, incompetent, technically incapacitated at times, deceitful, slow and even contemptuous towards customers. But that does not mean criminal, and patience is certainly the name of the game when these issues arise. And I mean *patience*, as in even weeks to months. (And TBH that's why you should only invest what you can afford to lose, because loss does not happen only through market collapse).

I'll say that about BTC now and I've been a supporter since the first year.  Didn't use to be, but now that it isn't a useful currency any more it is totally ponzi.
How long has it been? I both heard about it and wrote it off when I saw a YouTube ad for it.
Did they actually break the law? Since they're paying everyone back in worthless BCC is it possible they aren't actually in breach of contract?
Wow, that's insane. It's a bunch of hype men saying nothing of substance at all. How did anyone get hyped by this?!

Something here seems redundant.
"The main difference is that while most cryptos are primarily speculative in nature, BitConnect has literally no value or use outside of their pyramid scheme. 

It was sold and marketed as a ""lending platform"" that boasted an average of 1% interest per day. It was a classic ponzi scheme that even has it's own category (High-Yield Investment Program) which piggy-backed on the success and hype of cryptocurrency to serve as a front for what was really going on. 

The only purpose the token has ever served and will ever served was for their ""lending platform"". They claimed that they had a ""trading bot"" (a common claim made by HYIP ponzi schemes) that would distribute it's profits daily amongst people who were staking the BitConnect Coin through their website. Essentially, participants were required to send BTC/ETH to their website in order to buy and sell BitConnect Coin, which they could then ""lend"" to the bot to collect daily interest. Without the existence of that lending platform, participants are left with BitConnect Coins which serve no purpose, are only available to be traded on 1 or 2 real exchanges, and have a real value of zero considering there's no incentive for anybody to ever buy them"
I'm not familiar with the whole BCC thing. Is it mined? Is it decentralized? Or can a central party create it at will?
"Wasn't BCC promising guaranteed payouts though? To me that brings it into a whole different territory. There are no ""payouts"" in crypto and certainly no guaranteed anything."
Gotem
"People here didn't lose value of the token. They also ""stored"" their bitcoin on the Bitconnect Website. That is all stolen now as well."
There were lots of knowledgeable people in this sub screaming about its obvious ponzi nature.  It's a different thing entirely from some normie who doesn't understand crypto to call it a ponzi scheme.  
"NOBODY is promising 1% daily returns on BTC or BCH.  If someone is promising your ""GRAND RETURNS IN SHORT TIME"", its a fucking scam. Simple enough.  The reason why BCH is valuable, isnt because I can swap it into USD - its because merchants accept BCH as money."

"To a degree, is it any different than any other crypto currency?

Both have no intangible assets backing them, and gain value solely based on what other people feel they're worth. Both will crash if people lose faith, or if the ""HODL"" crowd decides to finally sell which reduces scarcity.

While there's definitely a huge difference in intention and community (this sub and others actually gives good info and promotes real tech), the actual currency BCC is propped up by just as much ""real value"" as the others, even if you disagree with what ""their"" value was."

"it lacks a sufficient privacy feature set to be called a privacy coin, but claims that as it's use case

it claims to have accomplished something related to privacy first but it hasn't.

it brings nothing new whatsoever to the table

people have been using TOR to hide their IP while using Bitcoin for about seven years.  Any cryptocurrency can be used with TOR, and there are many wallets for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and countless others with TOR before.

Stealth addresses have also been around for years before Verge.

That's the feature set for privacy with Verge, two extremely basic rudimentary steps that others have made, and ages ago.

If you want very strong trustless privacy, check out Monero

If you're willing to sacrifice the trustlessness for less on-chain overhead, something with Zcash's zkSnarks like Zcash, Komodo, ZCL, or Zen will work, as will a coin with Zerocoin protocol (Zcoin, PivX)

If you want pretty strong trustless privacy but don't want to sacrifice trustlessness OR scalability, GRIN is a cryptocurrency being built around Mimblewimble protocol.  If you want to know what Mimblewimble is, see what Andrew Poelstra and Greg Maxwell have to say about it.  There's some good talks on YouTube and on a few podcasts.

Also, ZEN may be tackling scalability by switching to DAG like RaiBlocks (XRB) and ByteBall (GBYTE) but it will continue to use zkSnarks which require trust in the ZEC trusted setup so it's not trustless.

If you think Verge has anything at all going for it, I suggest that in the future when you're trying to evaluate a new cryptocurrency, you look at how it compares to it's direct competitors.  As it stands, Verge simply does not come close to cutting it in it's field.  The only way that it has done anything for anyone is with stupid gains based on hollow hype.  Maybe they'll add confidential transactions later and still be years behind in it's field.  Maybe they'll just copy the code, give it a new name, and hype it as some ""new protocol"" (with a catchy name) for many months before implementing it, like they did with stealth addresses (Wraith protocol) and all the Verge sheeple will be like ""told you so!"" when they do so.  Maybe it'll go to the moon when this happens - the market is irrational, otherwise it wouldn't have to market cap that it does now - but real projects that are actually good for their use cases will come out on top in the long run."
No there is no fees you have to pay. You just get paid to promote the platform. Even Binance has an affiliate program to promote the exchange. Amazon, Walmart, and most internet sales sites have affiliate programs too. Not all platforms with affiliate programs are Ponzi Schemes.

You just stop it. The government guarantees that the fiat currency will be accepted, but it does not back that currency with anything. Fiat currency's acceptability is guaranteed, but it's value is not.
One is market driven, the other is literally forced upon us as what we should value.

"verge does very little for it's declared purpose

no ""privacy coin"" deserves any credit for having what verge does in 2017-2018

it wasn't created to bring previously lacking functionality

it was created so that it's creators could get rich from hollow hype

so ultimately, it was a success"
"It is a bitcoin with tor bolted on, and it claims to be a privacy coin. Not only that, but I frequently see shills promoting it as an alternative to monero. If bitcoin with tor isn't an alternative to something, verge is less of an alternative to that thing. Bitcoin with tor is not a valid privacy protecting alternative to monero, so neither is verge. Verge is branded as something it's not, and its shills quietly insert its name into lists with legit coins to make it seem legit too. They'll often be like: ""I understand that the main privacy coins, zcash, monero, and verge will be here forever, due to their very strong privacy, but what about xyz coin, can it measure up to those?"" So that if you've never heard of verge, but you have heard of monero and zcash and know them to be at least somewhat legit, you might easily be fooled, and the more times you see it the more likely you are to believe it. You can look into all of this, and I encourage you to. 

I'm not some anti verge shill for the hell of it. But whenever I see promotion of verge or people saying it's good or whatever I'll try to set them straight. I feel like it's almost irresponsible for the more knowledgeable community members not to point out obvious scams given how far reaching the fallout of Bitconnect was, even though I couldn't believe anyone would fall for it. 

Oh also, more recently the ""Wraith Protocol"" which first of all is JUST optional stealth addressing (actually called ""optional stealth addressing"", lol) and second of all does not even meet the definition of a protocol, which was waaaay overhyped as some godly and novel blockchain obfuscation technique, was NOT implemented. The developer of verge, Justin I'm pretty sure his name is, set a date of January 1st 2018, but failed to deliver his overhyped, and even if it had been implemented, mostly useless optional stealth addressing. Monero has had stealth addresses as the default since 2014, and it is extremely disingenuous to frame stealth addresses as an entirely new protocol, when multiple other coins have already implemented it. 

It's starting to finally cool off, but I know plenty of people who bought it and were making fun of me for hodling xmr, cuz verge was the next best thing and going to the moon or whatever they said. Just look at it now. Absolute p&d, nothing of value whatsoever. If people start talking about it again, you know better now. They've been shilling it since like 2 years ago, it's just gotten worse more recently. It is dying down now, again, but I'm sure they'll be back soon.

Other cryptos don't guarantee gains. 
I believe you can't do anything with your bcc for 200 days after you deposit Bitcoin. 
BCC is what? It's not Bitcoin Cash, is it?
most crypto's do give a starters advantage and some even give huge developer (fees) but the coins are just the coins the fiat value is decided by somewhat transparent  and real (most of the time) markets disconnected from the coin itself.
BCC = BitConnect
BCC is only Bitcoin Cash on Bittrex and few other exchanges, everywhere else BCC is known as BitConnect.
I believe that Bitcoin Cash tends to be abbreviated as BCH.

BTC doesn't have much value because it's incredibly hard to use, error prone, and barely accepted anywhere. If a gov't came out and went all BTC and guaranteed acceptance of it, it would at least have some value."
I sincerely hope it's none of those that you listed.
Meaning that with other coins you are free to sell whenever you want. BCC locks your funds so you can't do anything until your BCC get deposited, then they encourage reinvestment. 
Yes I know, but I have seen some people abbreviate it as BCC so I was confused.

"> how do other cryptocurrencies work differently from this ponzi scheme?

BitConnect isn't a crypto. Crypto and Ponzi scheme organization are different things.

BTC token on Bitcoin Core blockchain secured by energy burned, for example"
this is a fair question.  it can also be applied to fiat as well

PonziCoin: created by bitconnect out of thin air in exchange for other coins.
"You didn't bother to inform yourself about how it "" worked "", writing a stupid comment. Bitconect was from the top down a classic ponzi with huge interest rates. And it all went down because there was no more fresh blood coming into it, therefore no new people to pay the interest to older ones.

You had to buy bcc from them, basically giving them btc in exchange for an useless token. To make it better, you even had to give that one to them so you could ""receive"" interest. They made sure nothing was left for you to sell to not crash the ponzi. So about 90% of it was locked for interest, killing the supply, therefore very little to float around."

"Just stop it.

Fiat is backed by a government which owns land, a military, and employs people. It also collects taxes and builds infrastructure.

There's a massive difference between that and a crypto currency."
"If you think of Fiat like a crypto coin, its main use is tax payments, since no other asset class will be accepted by each government that does a fiat currency. Also, its about 3% physical, which has a local value, and is simple for grandma to understand. I doubt many over 50 will ever move to all crypto, unless forced. On the downside, governments can make as much fiat as they want, whenever they want, and they don't have to tell us what they are doing. Which we sorta accept, although the recent hyper digi-printing of money is getting kinda nuts, and can only end bad (again) Cryptos won't replace fiat for taxes, unless government concedes that it is incompetent to manage the money supply, and lets someone else run it. I'm not saying that could never happen, but we may need a new political party to do it. Anyone for the Crypto-party? 'Down with the Fed, up with crypto-taxes ! ' ;)"

These bastards took the BCC ticker away from bitcoin cash. Now we are stuck with BCH forever. 
That post about the apparent dark net bounties ... that shit is scary.

but at the same time, this could easily ruin crypto for all of us"
That thing with the mods just doesn't make sense.  Who is going to volunteer to talk to an angry crowd?
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHA, Jesus I feel so bad for laughing at those poor folks but AHAHAHAHAHA. Greed is a bitch with a 10 inch strap-on - and they're getting fucked.
I slightly feel bad for people that lost that much, slightly.  But shit, who in their right fucking mind would just hand over their life savings?  Nothing about the platform seemed even remotely legit or sustainable.  There's actually links to suicide hotlines, fuck man.
What happened?

"This shit - https://www.bitcaptera.io/
They even advertise as bitconnect 4.0.

Really sorry for all the people signing up to this."
I assume these people who “ put their life savings” in to Bitconnect are trolls. But at the same time this ponzi was huge. It was worth billions of dollars so someone had to be tricked. I have sympathy but at the same time I don’t. The website was riddled with grammatical errors and the way they even made the money to pay people in the first place with their “ trading bot” made no sense. If someone simply did the math on 1% per day for life they would realize it compounds quickly. At the same time, people make 100x returns on some cryptos so maybe it doesn’t sound too ridiculous. 
"If you upvote the posts regarding coworkers being annoying about bitcoin when it has a huge down spike saying ""i told you so."" you should probably shut the fuck up about bitconnect. these guys didnt just take the money and run. they have a huge communty holding coin that has lost all it's value and they are promising to refund money to anyone who has invested in the last two months. The higher up sponsors sincerely expect the coin to rebound.

To make a short point. You don't have all the answers. No one does. And you're just as annoying as your coworkers talking about bitcoin."
History right there. I'd say the scriptwriters are already on it, hoping for a Netflix deal.
"We all make dumb decisions; some dumber than others. We all pay our tuition in learning this market. The ones who learn the hard lessons keep going; the ones who don't wash out.

Hopefully any who were duped by this ponzi are able to live & learn, and make better choices in the future. Scams like this make the whole market look worse by association, and we need to help newer investors to recognize them & their inherent risks."

I lost $20k and I’m not crying about it. Luckily I was able to get that back plus a little more with affiliate commission from friends and my loan payments from last 70 days. People want to start blaming people and the world but it was our choice, our risk. Never invest what you can’t lose.

This wasn't exactly hidden knowledge.  People were calling out the obvious ponzi scheme from about 4 months ago, IIRC.  I just can't help but have zero sympathy for people who were warned but played with fire anyway.

"I've had my doubts about the legitimacy of BitConnect, or more specifically, its lending program ever since I heard users were investing in it. They claimed to be able to offer users something like 1% a day thanks to their ""trading bot and volatility software"". Now, I'm not an expert on trading; I do some now and then, but I can't help but ask: Is 1% daily interest really feasible for any trader, even with the assistance of bots? I think not. Surely there would be some losses down the road which could wipe out users' principals in one move.

&nbsp;

Considering how vague the information related to their lending program was, I'm inclined to think it was a Ponzi scheme from the start. It's not a question of whether anyone lost anything from investing in its lending program (there are already reports of users having lost significant sums of money), but rather how many users were affected and how much in total was lost."
[deleted]
Those cheap bitconnect adverts on YouTube should of given it away. You can clearly see they are actors reading from a script lol blatant scammers.
So they realized it's a ponzi only after they lost the money? It was OK before?
I have to say, I never invested in Bitconnect (specially I rather believe people saying something is scam than someone telling me, its good), but reading these titles made me quite scary, although I did not and would never invest into something more than I can afford. Man, scary shit
What app did you used to take these screenshots?

Darwin at it's finest. 
Well that was fucking brutal.  I know those people are morons for investing in a blatant ponzi scheme, but i still feel pretty horrible for the ones who lost everything.. People who shamelessly promoted this on YouTube and Twitter need to be ostracized and maybe even sued (i don't know what legal recourse there is here).. 
Frankly I hope authorities go after every person that ever gave a referral out for this ponzi.  It was clearly a scam from the start and there were plenty of warnings about it.  Be a good start to clean up some of these scammers from the crypto space and put some fear into the rest.  
"Trying so hard not to say ""I told you so"" to an acquaintance.

If you sell BCC for BTC then you’re buying BTC which would pump the price not dump it. 
It's the standard screenshot ability on my Galaxy S7 phone, there's an option to scroll the screenshot down a page, you can do it a lot, as you can see.
Somewhere, someone just decided to buy BCC and then found out it had already crashed by the time they went to buy.

They are optimistic because they'll be paid in BCC tokens that dropped in value 90% or more since most of them bought. It's the definition of mass delusion.

You are clearly not a Bitcoin user. No merchant will instruct the staff about that RBF bullshit. It's not an accident that nobody accepts 0-conf txs anymore on your broken chain. 
no, you always should get block from the miner, that the shortest path, non-mining nodes only add latency and increases orphan rate
"> What makes you expect that a majority of nodes is following an invalid chain today?

They're not, but only because miners aren't making such an invalid chain. If they did, a large chunk would follow it blindly before even noticing it was invalid.

> That's in fact what we have today.

I didn't say the situation today was acceptable. ;)

> I guess by that you mean that there may be four nations with comparably small operating costs

Yes, of course. So long as there are four of them, each could have ~25% and overall meet the criteria.

> What would you expect is the up-front investment cost for 10% of the hash rate...?

Depends on how many other people are trying to do it, for one thing...

> This is exactly why early-adopters (or early mines, if you will) of bitcoins or 'the rich' are bound to control Bitcoin.

I don't follow. Even if there's only 10 entities that each control 10%, that's (just barely) acceptable. And keep in mind that miners don't control Bitcoin...

> Have you timed the block validation time? What kind of processor can validate a current block in < 10 seconds?

The trick is that the transactions are validated when you relay them, so you can skip checking them again when a new block comes in.

> This isn't the obvious choice now, and I think will not be the case in the foreseeable future, as the current average global bandwidth of 7.2 Mbps would still require 8 hours of syncing the current block chain.

And that is why we need smaller blocks.

> Another important aspect for global adoption, I think, would be accessibility for mobile devices as many people do not have access to devices other than mobile phones. For this usage the current chain size is already prohibitive and there is no other way than having SPV wallets. This is where storage space becomes relevant again.

Modern smartphones can run a node just fine. Storage doesn't become relevant ever, because you don't need to store the blockchain, just process it."
"> They're not, but only because miners aren't making such an invalid chain. If they did, a large chunk would follow it blindly before even noticing it was invalid.

If miners are disincentivized from producing an invalid chain there's your decentralization at work. 

> Depends on how many other people are trying to do it, for one thing...

For another thing, how many miners do you think you'd need to buy? If [this](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate) is anyway near accurate and the current hash rate is at about 17 EH/s; how much do you think you'd need to invest to get to ~ 2EH/s (10%) as a single miner? How much to get to the 1% and ~200 PH/s?

> I don't follow. Even if there's only 10 entities that each control 10%, that's (just barely) acceptable. And keep in mind that miners don't control Bitcoin...

As much as I like _Miners don't control Bitcoin_ as a catchphrase; who else is there to keep the network functional and (other miners) honest? Who's validating transactions and therefore making Bitcoin a transferable asset? 

> The trick is that the transactions are validated when you relay them, so you can skip checking them again when a new block comes in.

How do you guarantee then that the transaction you relayed ended up being the same as the one included in the block without checking it?

> Modern smartphones can run a node just fine. Storage doesn't become relevant ever, because you don't need to store the blockchain, just process it.

If everyone decided to not store the entire block chain but rather their processed version where do newly connected nodes get their copy from to start processing on their own? Your point was that everyone (or at least 85% of people) should run a full node after all."
"This is a good question. First, full nodes are part of the p2p network, without which miners couldn’t communicate. More nodes means a more robust network.

More subtly, full nodes help in the case where two miners generate a new block at the same time. Full nodes will choose whichever block they see first and attach it to their local copy of the chain. When the second version arrives, the node sees a fork. Eventually a new block will arrive that makes one branch longer than the other, so the longer branch is kept, and the other discarded.

So even though full nodes don’t mine, they certainly play a role."
"> For Bitcoin to be secure/safe:

> *  At least 85% of economic activity should have the receiver verifying the payment using a full node he runs himself.

Where does that number even come from? When has that been the case the last time, if ever? Wouldn't it be more reasonable to say running a full node would be more related to receiving larger transactions? 

> *  No more than 30% of mining hashpower should be under the jurisdiction of a single State.

That seems really impractical as different states and countries have different operating costs (hardware, electricity and the like). Where's the economic incentive to mine in a country where operating costs are high and you can only hope to break even?

> *  No more than 10% of mining hashpower should be under the (de facto or de jure) control of a single entity.

Again, impractical for a miner to not join a pool as he'll get compensation for trying to find the next block there and not only for actually finding the next block (which is highly unlikely for a single miner, anyway). 

> Validation isn't free... it uses significant CPU time.

That would hold true for the IBD, I think. But what fraction of the time between blocks would you reasonably assume is used for validating blocks? "
"> If miners are disincentivized from producing an invalid chain there's your decentralization at work.
> 

No such disincentive exists, except if a majority of the economy is using full nodes.

> For another thing, how many miners do you think you'd need to buy?

Again, it depends on how many others are trying to do it...

> If this is anyway near accurate and the current hash rate is at about 17 EH/s; how much do you think you'd need to invest to get to ~ 2EH/s (10%) as a single miner?

If there's 50 other people trying to get to 10%, then the network now has 17 + 50 * 2 = 117 Eh/s, and your 2 Eh/s is only now ~2% :)

(I don't know the current market price for 2 Eh/s, but my point is that's not relevant.)

> As much as I like Miners don't control Bitcoin as a catchphrase; who else is there to keep the network functional and (other miners) honest? Who's validating transactions and therefore making Bitcoin a transferable asset?

Every full node. That's why they need to make up a clear majority of the economy.

> How do you guarantee then that the transaction you relayed ended up being the same as the one included in the block without checking it?

Compare them. Or rather, the hash of them. Hashes are much cheaper than verifying signatures.

> If everyone decided to not store the entire block chain but rather their processed version where do newly connected nodes get their copy from to start processing on their own? Your point was that everyone (or at least 85% of people) should run a full node after all.

From an archive node, which is perfectly safe to run in a handful of untrusted datacentres. They're only needed when a new node is starting, and the data isn't trusted.

(There's currently [over 18000 usable archive nodes on the network](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html), far more than enough.)"
"> No such disincentive exists, except if a majority of the economy is using full nodes.

There is still the disincentive of other miners producing valid blocks and rejecting invalid ones.

> (I don't know the current market price for 2 Eh/s, but my point is that's not relevant.)

It is entirely relevant as that's the make-or-break factor of getting decentralized hash rate. 

> Every full node. That's why they need to make up a clear majority of the economy.

Full nodes can only freeze BTC in place by rejecting invalid blocks, can't they. They can prohibit spurious transfers but can't facilitate the legitimate transfer of funds, right?

> Compare them. Or rather, the hash of them. Hashes are much cheaper than verifying signatures.

I assumed that comparing hashes would be a form of 'checking them'. Still for the IBD you'd need to verify every signature as you probably did not relay any transactions before, wouldn't you?

> From an archive node, which is perfectly safe to run in a handful of untrusted datacentres. They're only needed when a new node is starting, and the data isn't trusted.

No argument there. Even though there still could be centralization issues if everyone were to store them in data centers under the same jurisdiction if storage cost was only competitive in certain nations. So I guess it's hard to draw the line for centralization and defining necessary counter-measurements to centralization tendencies."
"> Logic. Think about the circumstances where 15% of the network has followed an invalid chain and stands to lose their income for several hours or even days; or else the 85% enforcing the validity rules loses their income instead. It's pretty obvious the 85% will prevail. Change the balance too much, and it becomes less obvious. Give a majority to the invalid-chain-followers (what we probably have today), and you start getting into situations where it's likely the invalid chain will prevail and the full nodes are all forced to give up their rules. End result: hardfork to the Fed, but with miners in charge instead of men appointed by elected officials.

What makes you expect that a majority of nodes is following an invalid chain today? Are you running a full node and confirm that the current chain is invalid? 

> Hard to tell. That's another reason why we need to aim for 85% instead of say 75% - if we're off by 10% (which can happen even with perfect data, due to market changes), it's not as big of a deal.

I agree that the market forces could lead to +/-10% swings.

> Not really, unless you want the rich to explicitly control Bitcoin...

That's in fact what we have today. More on that further down.

> Hopefully there's at least 4 nations that can compete on operating costs... it's not really that high of a bar to expect.

I guess by that you mean that there may be four nations with comparably small operating costs as I don't see why a country would actively seek to compete for bitcoin mining, i.e. giving up the power over their monetary policies (regarding fiat, obviously). 

> 10% finds 14 blocks on average every day. You don't get any benefit from a pool once you get to that size. Even 1% will find a block every day, more than enough.

What would you expect is the up-front investment cost for 10% of the hash rate in the US? What about in the EU? Whats the cost for 1% rate? This is exactly why early-adopters (or early mines, if you will) of bitcoins or 'the rich' are bound to control Bitcoin. If you aim at controlling 1% hash rate; there may be only 99 other people of 7bn that also control as much hash rate as you do; an insanely small fraction of the world population. 

> To avoid centralised relay backbones (needed to regain the censorship-resistant property), it needs to be less than 10 seconds at most for new blocks. Compact blocks gets us there, I think.

Have you timed the block validation time? What kind of processor can validate a current block in < 10 seconds?

> During IBD, we need the total sync time short enough that it's the obvious ""just do it"" default for users.

This isn't the obvious choice now, and I think will not be the case in the foreseeable future, as the current [average global bandwidth](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q1-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-executive-summary.pdf) of 7.2 Mbps would still require 8 hours of syncing the current block chain.

Another important aspect for global adoption, I think, would be accessibility for mobile devices as many people do not have access to devices other than mobile phones. For this usage the current chain size is already prohibitive and there is no other way than having SPV wallets. This is where storage space becomes relevant again. "
"> Where does that number even come from?

Hard to tell. That's another reason why we need to aim for 85% instead of say 75% - if we're off by 10% (which can happen even with perfect data, due to market changes), it's not as big of a deal.

> Wouldn't it be more reasonable to say running a full node would be more related to receiving larger transactions?

Not really, unless you want the rich to explicitly control Bitcoin...

> That seems really impractical as different states and countries have different operating costs (hardware, electricity and the like). Where's the economic incentive to mine in a country where operating costs are high and you can only hope to break even?

Hopefully there's at least 4 nations that can compete on operating costs... it's not really that high of a bar to expect.

> Again, impractical for a miner to not join a pool as he'll get compensation for trying to find the next block there and not only for actually finding the next block (which is highly unlikely for a single miner, anyway).

10% finds 14 blocks on average every day. You don't get any benefit from a pool once you get to that size. Even 1% will find a block every day, more than enough.

> That would hold true for the IBD, I think. But what fraction of the time between blocks would you reasonably assume is used for validating blocks?

To avoid centralised relay backbones (needed to regain the censorship-resistant property), it needs to be less than 10 seconds at most for new blocks. Compact blocks gets us there, I think.

During IBD, we need the total sync time short enough that it's the obvious ""just do it"" default for users."

Care to elaborate, why I don't have a point? For example, why do we even compare today's block chain and its growth to sinking storage cost and not take into account the 17%/year price reduction beginning 2011?  
They haven't?  What was the original size and when did the 1 MB come?
Blocks *haven't* been 1 MB since beginning of Bitcoin.
"> Why do you think, that the centralization of 2021 wouldn't be acceptable?

Because we've already agreed it will be much worse than today, and today is far from acceptable...

> Also, how do you define centralization? Is there a metric for that, such as (#non-mining full nodes)/(#non-mining full nodes + #mining full nodes)?

For Bitcoin to be secure/safe:

* At least 85% of economic activity should have the receiver verifying the payment using a full node he runs himself.
* No more than 30% of mining hashpower should be under the jurisdiction of a single State.
* No more than 10% of mining hashpower should be under the (de facto or de jure) control of a single entity.

> Regarding the x kB/block... is that the block size or growth per block?

Block size, aka growth to the blockchain per block.

> Why is IBD (internet bandwidth development, I assume?) the issue?

Initial Blockchain Download/sync. In other words, the downloading, validation, and processing of the entire Bitcoin on-chain history since 2009.

It's the issue because that's what every new Bitcoin user needs to do, to avoid reducing decentralisation.

> Why would the CPU be a limiting factor? Is it involved in more than validating the block before storing it?

Validation isn't free... it uses significant CPU time."
Are you now?  On-chain?
If the current situation wasn't already terrible, you might have a point.
"The original size was about 1 kB, since there were no transactions back then.

We didn't reach 1 MB until late 2017 (and that only due to spam, not actual use)."
"So he never said anything about nodes being centralized in data centers? Like idk, maybe:

>The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate"
"Why do you think, that the centralization of 2021 wouldn't be acceptable? Also, how do you define centralization? Is there a metric for that, such as (#non-mining full nodes)/(#non-mining full nodes + #mining full nodes)?

Regarding the x kB/block... is that the block size or growth per block? 

Why is IBD (internet bandwidth development, I assume?) the issue? To synchronize one years' worth of 1MB blocks in under a year you need internet speeds of greater than or equal to 0,013 Mb/s or roughly a quarter of the bandwidth a 56k modem offered back in the 90s. 

Why would the CPU be a limiting factor? Is it involved in more than validating the block before storing it?"
"You would have a point if the centralisation of 2021 (3 years from now, when it breaks-even with the 17%/year improvements) was acceptable. But the centralisation *today* is already very dangerous, and making it much worse is likely to be very catastrophic.

I would agree the situation was good in 2011 (although using it as a real-world baseline has other issues). If you want to use that, fine with me. The blockchain was 630 MB back then. If we account for 17% growth, that gives us 2 kB/block during 2012, 2.38 kB/block during 2013, 2.8 kB/block during 2014, 3.3 kB/block during 2015, 3.8 kB/block during 2016, 4.5 kB/block during 2017, and 5.2 kB/block this year. I don't think you're going to get consensus for this block size.

P.S. Storage price isn't relevant. It's IBD bandwidth and CPU you need to look at."

It is curious that 'lets be really really really careful with software changes' guys are suddenly pushing alpha software on their users.
Ah, who's excited to potentially lose their money by experimenting with a pre-alpha system that's hazardous that even the developers are against the judgement of launching said network publicly?
No. Did you ever heard from 0conf?
I'm sure there are use cases for it. Very fast micro payments (although payment channels already do that well).
don't be ignorant now boy
Zeroconf is more difficult you have to monitor for double spend attempts, not everyone is bitpay, most merchants can't do this easily
You also have to create segwit outputs first. 
"If you trust any other entity in the lightning network, you can also pay them off chain (in whatever currency they accept) to refill your side of the channel.

Yes, you do have to trust at least one entity, but no more than you currently trust your fiat exchange.

(If you're a unicorn who only buys crypto face to face with strangers, you have my deepest respect, but I don't have time for that shit myself)."
Then I guess I'm missing something. My understanding is that a chanel is a single time locket transaction that you keep replacing while invalidating the previous version with RBF

"Right now, it is guaranteed economically wasteful. There's about zero chance that there will be someone I need to pay with it before there are changes that will make me close channels.

The developers says there are still a few DB-breaking changes (i.e. those that makes you having to close the channels) left. Not many, but some.

Once the beta-version is launched, those changes has to be done transparently, but that is *not* a priority right now.

"This is of course only in one of the implementations, the one I follow most closely, Lightning Labs LND. So it is up to the developers of that implementation. At this point, nothing is *really* released that is meant for production, and honestly speaking the issue tracker could use some cleanup so I can't pinpoint the issue it is linked to :) But it obviously works for them, and is  not for outside use, so I should not complain :) I heard the Db breaking change things directly from one of the developers as near term, but should be one of the last of that kind.

My feel for the project is that everyone is working full speed ahead for the public beta."
If LN has major problems and a lot of people lose money, a class action against Lightning Labs and the individuals therein would likely be the first step. 
Lightning Labs executives would be summoned to court.
"If so, then I suspect they had some conference call with their DCG backers along the lines of:

By now distancing from that brand, they have basically exploited its value on the way up (Blockstream is rock star coders) as well as exploiting it now on the way down (Blockstream is the problem in Bitcoin) when it is negative, by distancing from it, basically doing a PR move of ""-1 times -1 equals +1"").

"As I understand it: the lightning hubs need sufficient funds to cover your transaction.

There are essentially two ways do get this information:

1. you trust the hub when they say they have the funds.
2. The hub pushes their current ledger out to you, so you can calculate the available funds yourself.

Number 2 is obviously not an improvement over layer 1. Number 1 is just a reinvention of the traditional banking system.
"
No. Your conception of LN is incorrect. To open the channel you must place on the blockchain a Funding Transaction. To withdraw funds or to replenish funds you must also use the blockchain for settlement. Check out the paper.
you have to send the opening transaction to prove and reserve the btc for the channel, and then at the end you have to do another transaction to close out the channel, and you have to do the closing transaction *immediately* if someone attempts to publish the channel in an improper state, so you not only have to pay for another transaction but you need to constantly monitor the chain and do it at just the right moment or you lose
"The channel open and channel close transactions are actual on chain transactions. Adding and taking out funds (in addition to the funds from the open/close) from the channel will also be on chain transactions. 

Everything inside the Lightning Network will not be on chain immediately, but you still need some on chain transactions to make Lightning work.

I might be wrong on this, but this seems to be also what the Lightning supporters are saying. See this Info graphic about Lightning for example: https://i.imgur.com/L10n4ET.png It is heavily slanted in the Pro Lightning direction, but it is at least clear about the amount of on chain transactions necessary.

The problem is by the time you guys finish, if you ever do, people will have moved on to other things. 5 years is an eternity in crypto world. 
"Lightning network is certainly a complicated decentralized exchange the same way the bitcoin blockchain is. You can move Bitcoins back and forth, that's it.

Most Bitcoin transactions involve off chain services (all except donations as far as I can tell). The lightning network is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain, but it doesn't change that dynamic.

As for regulations, you make a large number of assumptions here. What is a hub? Do you really think any user with more than one lightning network channel will be legally treated as a money transmitter?

When money transmission laws are written state by state, some might well attempt to restrict lightning network use within the state, but it's not clear that money transmission laws generally apply to cases where there is no custodial involvement.

In any case, my support of lightning network assumes that opening a second channel does not open me to money transmission regulation. Just as with bitcoin and bitcoin cash, lightning network could well be shut down at any moment (at least for my purposes since I'm not interested in breaking laws, even stupid ones).

It's not like this is a secret, there's absolutely a risk of regulatory problems, and people are working on reducing this risk.

"> The general idea is you should never be allowed to spend 100% of the coins in a channel, there will always be collateral. Hmm, does that sound like something else?

So, I open a channel with my coffee shop and commit $100 to it. But you're saying that once I've spent a certain amount, but not all of it, the coffee shop should start declining my transaction because my balance (still positive) is too low? 

I'm probably still mistaken... But yeah, I'll let them have their LN and stick with you guys. "
"By ""trying"" to close the channel, Bob needs to monitor the mempool to make sure Alice isn't trying to broadcast a transaction that spends the coins he thinks he has?

ANd if he does see it, he needs to do what, spend a different transaction at a higher fee and HOPE miners choose that one rather than the original? 

This sounds.... like a really bad idea? Except everyone believes it'll work without any evidence because they want to believe, apparently?"
"My guess is that pretty much any lightning node will also perform as a watcher. Why? Because it's essentially very easy, and a way to get a tiny bit more fees - and possibly a bounty if he should catch a cheater. The bounty is built into the system, guaranteed by the anti-cheat transaction. The cheater will not get any money, he'll lost all *his* money.

We'll not be see any fraud. It'll pretty much be economically unfeasible to get away with it."
"The reason that using BTC, BCH or any other crypto doesn't fall under those regulations is because they are peer-to-peer and there is no intermediary. LN hubs will be intermediaries between people making transactions and, when the time comes, they will most assuredly fall under the classification of intermediary/money exchanger.

LN is NOT a decentralized exchange because *if it was, it would serve no purpose*.

LN will NEVER be a P2P system because why the fuck would someone do an on-chain TX just to open a channel for a LN transaction and then *another* on-chain TX to close the channel.

If you actually applied real life economics and psychology to your support of LN that support would erode immediately. As of this moment, LN is simply an intellectual exercise, a solution looking for a problem, and it has ZERO utility.

Mark my words, if LN is ever released and functional, adoption will be a fraction of a percent and the BTC mempool will not budge. When it fails, instead of BTC shills demanding that people adopt Segwit, they'll be demanding that people adopt LN. Meanwhile BTC will continue to bleed support and value.

The average person doesn't give a fuck about Segwit or LN or any other development project in the echo chamber, they want to know how much their BTC is worth and how much it costs to move it around."

"The ""idea"" they floated is you should proceed to receive all your income on LN, so you'll never need to close a channel and it'll never deplete. :3"
i literally can't understand how Bob's version is supposed to be able to win over Alice's, here, [see if you can figure this fucking shit out](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#revoked-transaction-close-handling).. there's a FIXME in there so that's not encouraging lol
"you don't have any references for how these theoretical ""anti-cheat transactions"" would work do you"
"Assuming the watcher is not bribed or ddos'ed so that the theft is not detected before its mined. 

Such a great system it will generate nodes to watch watchers,  services insuring funds,  ratings agencies fir nodes...  Innovation at its finest "
"Again, what do you think a lightning network hub is? It's not defined in the lightning network specs, most people use it as a rough description of network topology, but never with a fixed definition (which could be used by regulators).

Money transmitting laws are written to regulate activities that involve taking and transferring custody of money between two parties. Lightning network was designed intentionally to avoid giving custody (ability to steal or block) to any node between the sender and receiver.

This means that the issue is legally open to interpretation in many jurisdictions (most US states and most countries).

So no, no matter how often an anonymous redditor assures me that a vaguely defined hub will be interpreted as a money transmitter in all of a hundred or so relevant jurisdictions, I'm not particularly convinced.

Money is being moved on lightning network today, shuffling the balance of intermediate nodes in the process. It'll be fascinating to see which state prosecutors are interested enough in lightning network protocols to issue a memorandum or send a cease and desist letter to a person with more than one open channel.

Yes, the lightning network may be largely useless if it can't be used as designed. No, your interpretation of worldwide money transmitting law isn't universal or particularly authoritative."
"Well, if it's any solace, 99% of us will be Alice's in this scenario :p

"
"The ""anti-cheat"" tx is an already signed transaction from the counterparty that grants all the funds in the channel. If Alice tries to cheat Bob, then if Bob/watcher sees the violation in time, they broadcast the punishment transaction. If the punishment transaction is mined before the cheating tx's timelock expires, then Bob gets all the money in the channel."
"WHO are you going to DDOS? All of them? There is no reason you should know what watcher node your partner is using.

Also, any non-cooperative channel close requires more confirmations before funds are spent. This theft is going to have an extremely low probability rate of succeeding.

But all this is known."
that's sorta the idea basically, it's so complicated and messy to be a hub that normal people can't do it, you're supposed to give in and just let the smart bank people handle all the complicated fraud prevention.. like the old world, just instead of having real life and governments and shit to confuse people with they have to make their own virtual mess to be the saviors of
i still don't get it, why does the punishment transaction *not* work if alice *hasn't* broadcast the wrong settlement??
"What is well known are the massively increased security risks such a broken system of incentives introduces.  

How do we know this is true? Even the most ardent fans refuse to put even a dollar of their own money at risk on LN.  Fans like  you... "
"I do not remember the precise mechanism off the top of my head, but I believe it is something like the following: to update the state of the channel, the participants end up revealing a preimage, and that preimage is part of the necessary spending condition for the penalty transaction. That way, the penalty tx can only be valid with the knowledge derived from a broadcast transaction that doesn't have the fully updated state. In other words, one can't spend the penalty tx without the ""secret"" provided by the malicious transaction."
"yeah no you pretty much figured out how weird and fragile it is 

when the channel first opens, nobody's actually sent any transactions that reapportion any of the money in the channels, so there's nothing you can do to defraud 

but as soon as some money does move in the channel, then all that the party that's supposedly been paid actually *has* is an unsent transaction that credits them-- now in the case that the other party *tries* to close the channel, they *must* immediately transmit the transaction crediting them, or else the old initial state where they're not credited will be realized

why shouldn't you try to close out channels early to avoid payments? why because you'd be severely punished somehow of course-- oh and also it's all 100% anonymous don't worry"
Yeah, I love double spends. 2 coffees for one!
">Alice can close the channel at anytime if Bob tries to steal the coins, and safely get their coins back.

...only if Alice's closing transaction confirms in time. If it's stuck... good luck.

>why shoulnd't Bob immediately start trying to close the channel and take the coins?

You guessed it, high fees. In the case where Alice steals _less_ than the closing fees, Bob might even say ""fuck it"" and let it go. Note that fees are highly uncertain, mempool can spike when you try to close, your game-theory calculations go out of the window.

>once she's spent 100% of the coins, shouldn't Alice try to steal the coins back?

The general idea is you should never be allowed to spend 100% of the coins in a channel, there will always be collateral. Hmm, does that sound like something else? 

>Or, as this is BCH, perhaps none of it will ever apply! :)

The blockchain itself is the best form of money ever, ain't nobody's taking it away from me. "
"you're right, that's not an argument, i didn't argue with you, i *offered to help you*

is that the problem, is that what you're after, you wish i was arguing rather than offering to help, i guess i can see that"
"The solution to the problem is to give them fiat to avoid a transaction?

Why not just skip the entire convoluted process and just use fiat?"
You know why I trust my fiat exchange though? They're insured with a contract backed by the government and they have a customer service department that will service my needs within minutes. Does Blockstream have that?
"No, that is the settlement transaction, and there is no RBF involved (not necessarily, anyway), because this settlement transaction is private: they both agree The latest is the valid one.

The channel is a confimed transaction with funds only both owners together can move.

So you see, there is one transaction to open, and one transaction to close the channel."
"The ""held in stasis"" transaction is the ""retaliation"" in case of channel breach, aka the thing watchtowers use to go after thieves.

>People steal you money

>Release Cerberus

>Stuck in mempool

>Original Locktime channel tx expires / theft tx confirms

>Lose metric crapton of money"
"uh well it can be *automated* but you need automatic *constant monitoring of the chain with a hot wallet ready to transact at any moment*, you could lose money if you just lose network connectivity for a while, so it's generally agreed you'll need to outsource this to third party fraud monitors.. the only idea of how this could actually be decentralized is a very vague research topic called ""punishment transactions"" or ""justice transactions"" or something (it seems that it's such a new non-existent idea it really doesn't have a particular name yet)"
"a fork is a voluntary mutual dissociation between *equal peers*, there isn't one side that ""is"" the fork and the other is not, both are forks away from each other-- Bitcoin doesn't have a center"
"Really? You are sure of that? 

They've been saying it will be ready in a few months... for 3 years. Just recently, they said they need another ""18 months."" That would be almost 5 years away from when LN was initially proposed.

5 years. Kind of a long time. Doesn't that strike you as odd, at least to a non-negligible degree?"
Ok, but when the beta (if it ever comes out) is still proven to be flawed will you *then* come back home? We're waiting.
Oh I see. Thank you for the clarification!
"What if someone uses software that is not created by Lightning Labs but implements the lightning network specification, and the flaw is in the specification itself? Would the software vendor be liable or the person who wrote the specification? Can someone who writes a specification (specifically with a ""use at your own risk"" clause) be held liable when someone else implements it (without permission as it's not required) and it goes wrong?"
So if I use linux and a bug wipes out my data, can I take Linux Torvalds to court?
That is not an argument. Open your eyes.
"Well. That instant and ""almost free"" is not that special because it's offchain. It's like Paypal. It's easy to achive. The real challenge is to do it onchain. Atomic Swaps will have every Coin. It was already made with BCH too. BCH is almost free as well it' already less than a cent to transact and it is basically instant with 0conf."
Bitcoin Cash was before Roger came into the game. He uses Bitcoin on a daily basis since years as an entrepreneur. It's a very diffrent thing compared to all those people which came into this cryptogame november'17 for the quick buck.
"Well. There is no double spend issue. Let me tell you this. Those 10min block intervalls are a fundamental security feature. That's why Litecoin isn't as much as valueable as Bitcoin just because ""it mines faster""."
"What problem are we trying to avoid?

If I'm regularly buying crypto with Fiat (and I am) to replace amounts I've spent, it's no different from today, I just make way fewer on chain transactions.

It absolutely is a step backwards if you make a purchase the size of your lightning channel funds and then turn around and refill the lightning channel from a Bitcoin address. If you're making large transactions, the size of the amounts you lock into lightning, might as well stick to on chain transactions.

For a service like nicehash or other mining pools that pay me a few mBTC every day, it's (potentially, pending actual rollout) absolutely fantastic! I can have provable control over my coins the moment they're paid (avoiding the December nicehash hack) with daily accrual, and I can forward my money to any vendor or exchange, or even cash out on chain to rebalance once a month or so (far less than I do today to minimize risk of letting nicehash hold my bitcoins at the cost of more congestion and ever higher fees).

Lightning won't serve all use cases equally. But nicehash mining is one where a functioning lightning network would be incredibly convenient and massively reduce the number of on chain transactions I make today (further reducing congestion for all other bitcoin users)."
"I mean, you'd be sending fiat to the same exchange.

Obviously the bitcoin code is much longer battle tested compared to the nascent lightning network code, but the code is no less open source, and the cryptographic ties to the Bitcoin network still exist.

I won't be an alpha tester, but I'll definitely trust the lightning network with the portion of my mining earnings I used to trust to the entirely uninsured nicehash!"
"What I don't get about that part is:

Alice can close the channel at anytime if Bob tries to steal the coins, and safely get their coins back.

Bob can also close the channel at any time if Alice tries to steal the coin, and then he gets the coins.

So, why shoulnd't Bob immediately start trying to close the channel and take the coins?

And why, once she's spent 100% of the coins, shouldn't Alice try to steal the coins back? Worst case is Bob gets the coins just like he thought he would. Best case is all that spending was free.

Again, obviously I'm clueless about LN, just piecing together what its sounded like over the last couple of years.

Or, as this is BCH, perhaps none of it will ever apply! :)"
I see. Yeah my understanding from the paper is that the periods of time to recognize dishonest behavior and close the channel are on the order of 24 or 48 hours, so if I can come online at least that often then my node can automate this auditing, correct?
Bitcoin gold is a peer to BCH? I never looked at it like that.
"Yes, I am sure. Why am I sure? Because I spend time in the foras for development. I test the software and run a node on the testnet myself. QaI have reported a bug that was quickly fixed. I see the level of cooperation in the team.

"
"So LN is now just a more complicated centralized exchange. Any hubs will eventually be classified as money exchangers, the same as existing exchanges, and be subject to the same regulation and laws. This means that the only companies that will be capable of running LN hubs are the exchanges that already exist, Coinbase, Gemini, etc.

So now not only would having BTC on LN mean you don't have the keys to your wallet, any problems would be impossible to get any kind of resolution. 

How in the fuck could ANY BTC supporter think this is a good idea. The whole fucking narrative has been about ""decentralization"" and a ""trustless system"" yet *every single detail* related to LN is the opposite of those things."

Funny that the entire world is coming as one for the crypto downfall this week and here we have a rant going on between BTCvBCH. 
it's almost as if there's some deeper hidden motive from which you could draw a far more consistent picture explaining their actions
It's like they're in a rush for something... 
"It's called ""we feel threatened, so now we go full YOLO with people's money"". 

If LN is not released before BTC has a true, honest-to-god crash (oldies will tell you we ain't saw nothing yet), it might never recover as BCH rises above it just by not being a shitcoin. Hence the hail-mary. "
They don't have the time to be careful, they have to deliver ... **18 month are too long**.
You sure they don't work for Microsoft?
Looks like the penny dropped. LN has brought the whole ecosystem down. 
lol they are clearly trying to force this out asap because bch has them feeling all spooked 
"all part of the plan. Hell, if LN blows up in their face - even better and adoption will be slower
 "
"I personally think that every crypto holder who owns zero BTC should encourage all BTC users to move their funds at once to LN.

Edit: here's the problem I see. You can't test if the economic incentives work on testnet. There's no real way to prove the security until you deploy on mainnet and let people guinea pig it for a while. That's kinda the unfortunate nature of betting your coins scaling on an unproven high risk technology that hasn't even been successfully deployed on an altcoin yet.  It's gotta start somewhere, might as well ""fail fast"" as they say in the business these days...."
But you need to do a (currently expensive) on chain transaction to get funds into the lightning network. If it where just a few cents to open a channel then I could see myself try it out, but now you need a expensive transaction and you wouldn't want to send just a little bit in that case. 
Like, you know, banks.
Exactly. Blockstream needed an update on the carrot badly as the pleb was getting restless on them, so they took the risk, pushing live a very limited no-routing untested version with risk of losing money. All because of how desperate they were going.
Yeah this is why I can't believe big companies are dealing with Core and blockstream. They are toxic and their poor decision making is going to bring down anyone associated with them.
"Maybe she realized there will be blowback since she is pretty much a figurehead for it.

Then again the PR angle makes much more sense to me. No such thing as bad publicity, and LN needs publicity to keep the dream alive."
I'm not testing your software for you with my money thanks. 
99% of rBitcoin people are never gonna open a channel anyway, they will only celebrate when they hear LN news and then keep on hodling.
agree.. the stark chick appears to have integrity.  LN is still hot, fire, bullsh!t though. 
Why has the BTC price tanked the least then?
"the irony here is that LN is already 10x more stable than what almost all other projects in the space put out there.

there is certainly pressure in the community to deliver (thanks to r/btc no less, but also due to the generally exploding traffic). so there's certainly a conflict between security-perfectionism and release-early-release-often.

and you guys know what? despite all the conspiracies here, there is no one who can decide or control or stop people from using LN on the mainnet."
I am curious and I would probably try it. But it would cost 30$ to open a channel an another 30$ to close it. So yeah, most people won't use it.

The way these people are trying to rush its use by companies is idiotic. There's a lot of money on the line to be 'testing' with.

"I start to see where this is going. A businessman in a tie tries to recruit Cypherpunks against his masters will, because he is so ingenious that he sees the potential where his master sees only risk. Its like I'm back in the 90's again in some stereo type sci-fi flick.

Please let this guy and his recruited cypherpunks explore how great the LN works. And please let him tweet it to the world. Can't wait for the day we will see something like:

Anyone who deploys or incites other to deploy this unfinished, untested pre-alpha piece of software on the mainnet, or even fails to warn others, faces personal and criminal liabilitiy once people start losing funds
How I see this panning out is a few people make successful transaction with the LN and r/bitcoin claims it safe and ready. Then more people jump on to the promise of cheap transactions and lose their BTC while pre-alpha testing the software. Then it's a race to come up with some bs excuses why this has happened as it definitely wasn't due to shitty software (Core has the best minds working on BTC, remember?)
"Pure desperation.

And I suspect Stark is not so happy about it also because when the LN starts losing real money for people, the groundswell of rage over it will hurt the LN that much more. It's bad enough it can't really work the way they think it will, don't want to deploy it while it's actually broken too."

"Isn't it just a single transaction?

Like the ""channel"" was essentially an ""open"" transaction, which would just be a notification about the transaction, but no actual activity on the blockchain. It would only hit the blockchain when it finalized.

The ""magic"" of LN was that you could offer this transaction to your peer and then be able to transact with them incrementally - they couldn't just take your spend all the money immediately. Likewise, there were gaurds to prevent you from trying to rescind it. That's all LN seemed like to me, of course now it probably tries to discover other nodes to route payments across the universe and makes coffee at the same time, which is why its still only two weeks away..."
"If you're never going to do 3 Bitcoin transactions, then no, LN doesn't make sense for you.

Personally, I have BTC to use it. Right now, it's too uneconomic, so I *do* look forward to it becoming economically feasible again.

Thing is: you're not going to open/close channels *that* often. But it'll make sense economically if you're able to use the LN channel for as little as 3-4 transactions. "

"There are people that are perfectly willing to risk it now, on the mainnet. They all know what they are doing.

You can write whatever you want in an EULA or contract, it doesn't necessarily mean it's valid. "

"You’ve just conflated two absolutely different things because they share a word? Sorry, that’s not how it works.

Military spending is not a social policy."
"It all comes from the same pot: tax payers.

And both serve the society."
"> Wrong. I was extremely poor.

wrong what exactly? you would tell your parents to fuck off and die?

> It's never too late to learn

i know what the term collectivism means, i don't know what do you mean when you use it in context of this discussion. it's completely irrelevant.

> Companies like Coinbase will flourish without friction from dealing with a state

unless they break regulations

> Capitalism is fine

just like with ""socialism"" before, ""capitalism"" isn't a thing, it's a concept that is manifested in reality in form of a whole spectrum of government policies. ""capitalism is fine"" bears no useful meaning other than maybe you are just fine with capitalism as a concept?

> central banking isn't

yeah, hopefully"
"I'm not mining anything here (in this country).

My bitcoin.com account is mining BCH at the moment. (Most profitable coin selection, converting BTC to BCH if it mines BTC)."
"to expand, because i typed previous comment on a bus:

> No

you can disagree with what government is spending those money for or you can disagree with the amount government is billing you but neither of those change the fact that tax is bill to you from government.

> Yes. Darwinism.

that just means you're a horrible human being or a maximalist 15 year old. i'm sure you wouldn't say that if your parents went broke and/or got sick, right? if you would - you're even worse.

if you wouldn't - why? it's not like you have some contractual relations with your parents that oblige you to be helping them? the answer is that you relate to your parents and don't want them to suffer. it's fine when your urge to reduce suffering of those whom you relate to decreases with degree of separation, but any line you draw where you say ""here i care, there i don't give a shit, those chumps can go die"" is arbitrary. the only sensible position is to accept that you relate to all human beings.

> Open blockchains erode power of collectivists

i don't know what collectivists are or how blockchains erode anything related to collectivism, but they do erode power of greedy capitalist bankers and corrupt kleptocratic governments, which *i* am very happy about."
Well I’m happy people like you are tiny fraction of population and we will never have a society based on Darwinism.
"> Taxes are bills to fund the government that provides you services

No

> So fuck everybody who is poor and can’t paid for a dedicated road?

Yes. Darwinism. Open blockchains will maximize wealth inequality. There's no solution except personal responsibility

> they exist for the better of a society

Open blockchains erode power of collectivists and I can't be more happy about it"
Gracias!
Yes this is the point - to share and therefore answer questions or give the info:)
"If you already know them I guess you could buy the tickets in their name and then sending them the ticket? 

If you mean people that you don't even know, then I don't know. There is no shortage of people wanting to get out, most people I know are eager to leave, even myself. You would have to use a middle man that you trust so you won't get scammed. "
"BTC is more common but because of the high fees only the rich use it to buy houses and yachts.

"> i'm sure you wouldn't say that if your parents went broke and/or got sick, right?

Wrong. I was extremely poor. Yet enforced wealth redistribution is cancer

It's never too late to learn. I'm from Russia btw

Nope. Companies like Coinbase will flourish without friction from dealing with a state. Capitalism is fine, central banking isn't"
"Yes it is. It is the foundation and bedrock that allows higher order social functions to be built.

Fact is it comes from the same people it serves.
