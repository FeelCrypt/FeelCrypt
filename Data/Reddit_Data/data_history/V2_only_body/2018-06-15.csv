Don't buy it. XRP is not for you. Case closed.
I can't click the link so I'm just going to type /r/btc 
I am the OP and I need I make a correction. The time is actually the time since when they became a mod and not their Reddit lifespan. But still, out of 22 mods, only 2 mods have been there longer than 7 months. Now there has been a claim that some mods are on alt accounts, however we can't verify this claim.
Ok, I get it now, thanks
I haven't said that, obviously. but otherwise you're right
Which claim would you like proof for? Also check out the response from u/largesnorlax 
"You are more the welcome to make an application in r/cryptorecruiting

We don’t need an audit but are always looking for moderators with skills to help with mod duties. "
You don’t have to personally trust me, that’s why we have public modlogs and work with the bitcoin uncensored team
You are quoting 2 different people.
No, just donate... So, he can cry out loud ^^^^
I have nothing to do with the bitcoin core / cash flame wars. Don’t even try to bring me into that argument.
I never seen anything good said about BCH on rCC. And anytime something controversial that's proBCH or antiBTC gets posted, the mods lean towards censoring in favour of BTC. It's downright pissing me off and has made me browse rCC less and less. BCH gets an insane amount of hate for no reason. People forget that those who support BCH are BITCOINERS.
"When the post was locked it was at 3.3k. How could this sub have brigaded that when it's rare to see a post break 500 here? 

In addition:
1. the thread had hundreds of upvotes before somebody linked it here
2. the link here didn't tell people to go brigade

Linking to a reddit post in another subreddit is NOT against reddit content policy."
What do you define as brigading? Are you just going to remove any post negative to BTC and /r/Bitcoin as soon as it gets linked here? Those rules are stupid regardless but I really want to know. 
"This is a long winded load of crap. BCH and BTC communities are not comparable. One is organic, the other is manufactured censorship, and that’s well known. 

R/CC has fallen victim as well, the community is pretty crap. "
"That's like saying ""I'm not taking sides in WWII because I don't want to be part of it""."
At this point, the worst is the BCH group talking about their coin whilst using the word Bitcoin, with no appendage of any sort. 
Bch is basically the baby Jesus in terms of purity 
Well it sure isn’t public.  Anything else?
I'm actually for large blocks but still paid by AXA apparently lol
I was obviously heavily in the negative when I made that edit
"Okay “throwaway” 

I’m so glad there are far better people in here to represent the BCH community. It’s extremely clear that you just want to create conflict between all three communities. I have no idea what you hope to gain from it - other than some sort of sick enjoyment."
This is r/btc. Anyone who isn’t completely for large blocks was bought off by AXA long ago. 
"Wow dude...

"> was there much to add to the thread anyway?

The market says ""Yes"".  We were having very active discussions.  

The whole thread had 3,321 points (92% upvoted), 1139 comments, ranked #1 on the rCryptocurrency sub, meaning that people liked the thread, and they found the information useful.  Let people talk and share information.

Once the mods lock a thread, it drops like a stone, and fades away.
"
">was there much to add to the thread anyway? I

This is not the problem you know that if someone want to say something more, he/she can do it elsewhere, independently of any censure. 

The question should be: what's the reason of censoring an ongoing discussion on that sub/thread/subject/case specifically ? 

I am not sure if you see the uncomfortable situation you are in when you insinuate that the censure was based on a : "" you don't have anything to say more than what was said."" 

Is it the moderator's job to decide on behalf of ppl about what to express on a given subject? Does it cost something to the sub if a discussion lasts thousand of posts? Or maybe,  was there any threat to the sub regarding the thread's popularity it was gaining and the opinion which was expressed ? "
You could provide proof of your claims....
"I think this is a fair offer, and I'd be happy to take you up on it. Either to audit or to roll up my sleeves and pitch in.

Dunno if I'm well enough known here for my word to carry any weight, but it's worth a try."
I didn't say anything about secrecy
So...we should just trust you then?
"> We don’t even have a donations address for crying out loud.

So you're the mod of the mods over there?

Can I be a mod?"
">You have an answer for everything. I’m impressed.

Me too, 

You have an infinite amount of useless questions.. "
"Oh we will just take your word for it then, thanks for debunking my ""crack pot"" theories with your ad hominem rebuttal.  This is the low level type of arguments that the small block Core cult use [that dwell on the very bottom of Graham's pyramid of disagreement](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/839m0f/interesting_info_from_rick_falkvinge_about_how/).  

All you can do is name call and use sock puppets to make it appear as if there is some type of numbered resistance against common sense in the hope that some mindless sheep will follow.  You can take your mindless sheep, and we will take the people who are capable of independent thought."
"Can you be more specific so that the rest of us can understand this?  

It looks like user posted about a Monero competitor, and was immediately censored and then banned by a r/Monero mod on r/CryptoCurrency 

If there is more to this story, please do tell so that we can understand exactly what does on over there "
That was actually the full posts (except last one I only linked the start without clipping anything before that) - surprising how little info the mod gave really
"Hey mate - seeing as this has all drawn so much discussion - the team are going to address the properly with a post.

I can easily say that if hadn’t been linked and brigaded by this subreddit it probably would still be up. I wasn’t really around during the week that happened, but I don’t believe the team did anything with ill intention. 

Personally I can say that I don’t want to encourage the constant fighting between r/BTC and r/bitcoin I mean r/cryptocurrency isn’t a battleground for this... it makes the whole space look petty and unprofessional. 

Equally I think there have been posts about BCH that got to the front page that seemed to just attack the project. There’s obviously a lot of debate about the process of claiming the title of bitcoin. Anytime there is a post made about BTC or BCH both subreddits come in and attack each other. It’s just not healthy and in reality both are completely guilty of baiting each other and refusing to listen to reasonable discussion points.

Honestly I just want r/cryptocurrency to be about crypto news and discussion to promote the growth and adoption for everyone.

I personally don’t have any issues with any coins, even if I’m treated like shit by members of their communities. 

Our subreddit is very unique as it is used to discuss multiple currencies under one roof, so it’s very complex and difficult to manage and quite often someone is upset about a decision either way. 

People from each community accuse us of being paid off or puppets from their “competitors” so it’s nothing new.

What you don’t hear about is all the good work that we spend hours doing, who ever shouts the loudest seems to get attention and often they are shouting because of something they don’t agree with. 

I would love to see our level of transparency and communication from all crypto subs, I’m responding to all these comments today to help provide a clearer picture against so much false information. "
I didn’t want the team to be doxxed or compromised, as we were pretty shaken and it felt like the right thing to do in that moment. We pride our selves on not taking any money, referrals or donations. Having this happen to us felt like a betrayal and switching the accounts over might have looked like an overreaction, but it was the right move. Later on we also found out that one of the mods had personally received death threats through the post from information collected via his old mod account. I have no idea how they managed to do that but some people are just insane. Unfortunately a few users here also love trying to turn everything into a conspiracy. 
Can you please DM me with snips I’m having trouble finding some of these comments in the backend.
I’ll take a look at this for you
"Well I think these screenshots are pretty damning in the face of the latest smear campaign. 

I wanted to make a thread about it on this sub or on r/cc but I figured it’s just bad sportsmanship to stoop to their levels."
Actually there is nothing about the truth which doesn't align with bitcoin and BCH's narrative, sadly the same can't be said for BTC
BCH  thrives on conspiracies. It's all they have left. r/btc is the r/The_Donald of cryptocurrency. They didn't reach out because finding out the truth is a distraction to the conspiracy they are creating. 
"Conspiracies? Is the company who manages your Bitcoin’s source code a corporate or a foundation? How do they plan to make money? Donations?

The only conspiracy here is how people like you function with this obvious lack of awareness. Must be zombies.

No you don't. Nobody at Reddit HQ is going to ban you for failing to enforce rules. You still haven't even defined brigading either which clearly shows your mod team has no idea what it was doing and is just censoring. 
Is all it takes to get a thread locked on your sub just to link from a sub with opposing views and mass downvotes using bots? For the third time what do you define as brigading?

"Maybe not as simple, they had $80 million to spend (what’s announced anyway); they spent a lot on you.

I remember when I first joined the space and I’d surf rBitcoin, there was this bot (or a very dedicated human) who would post a warning that Bitcoin.com is a scam after every post mentioning it. 

For the longest time, I honestly believed them, I’d never visit Bitcoin.com and I always felt this distrust towards it. Then one day, I followed jessquit (before he was banned) from rBitcoin to here, and my eyes were opened. 

This is how effective censorship is and controlling the narrative is, so I don’t blame you. 

I wish you clarity and all the best of luck my friend. "
I was just saying peace to you 
There is literally no definition of brigading anywhere in your post or those links. There is no site wide rule indicating that mods *must* enforce rules either. Sabotaged sub. 
"So you can't and haven't said what brigading is because the team is writing about it. That is, at the time the post was locked you had no specific definition and the team did it just because 'link'.

What are you referring exactly in the expanded rules?"
[deleted]
Thanks, same to you.
Did you even click on the expanded rules or  just nah?
"It’s far simpler than this: a corporate hijacking of a very prominent subreddit and forum by your current resident corporate and overlords, Blockstream, which over the past three years brainwashed many puppets like you into believing what they currently believe. 

Your pressure as a collective of mindless sock-puppets reporting twitter profiles, creating fake reviews on iOS applications, reporting brigading here, and the plethora of immoral acts is what ends up affecting other communities.

Your masters wish they can control every other community though, including this one, I’ll assure you of that. "
"AFAIK it is organic, believe me - I've spent a lot of timing looking into it and talking to the vechain foundation / mod team about it.

At most try 100 upvotes in a span of 60 minutes - which is very high, but not thousands per minute like you claim.

Do you remember that they were banned for 30 days for brigading? They have cleaned up their act A LOT and I respect the lengths that they went to, to ensure the community plays by the rules - since then they are very open to communication.

There's clearly a lot of passionate vechain supports, we do submit these particular threads to the reddit admins to check for signs of vote manipulation and it hasn't come back as an issue. I hope that answers your question."
"We actually have duty to create guidelines and follow them. We have adopted Reddit's policies as part of those guidelines. Brigading isn't just about ""magical internet points"" people do it to suppress opposing thoughts and ideas with downvotes or force a particular view point with upvotes and post a flood of comments - instead of letting this conversation happen **organically.**

A new post is being written up about this - to clarify how brigading impacts r/cc. For now, you can read our expanded rules if you wish to know more. Crossposting links will be handled on a case-by-case basis - especially if the crosspost is disingenuous. "
The removal of this specific thread showed all non BCH fanboys the real status of r/cc ... so don't wonder that your question isn't answered.
So, take  2 sec and ask yourself this time : what does all this  censure  against a precise group/position look  for a neutral outsider?  You will be considered on the neutrality and the objectivity of your opinion. 
"I would agree with you that there is hardly any positive discussion about BCH. I simply can’t control that or stop the community from despising it - which a lot of them seem to do.

Honestly there are plenty of other coins where their own respective subreddits are full of positive news but they aren’t well received on r/cc it’s not a unique aspect of BCH. 

I’ve read plenty of opinions as to why this is the case, from both sides of the fence. It seems to really come down to the attitudes of certain people in the community and those who represent the project - not so much the tech - which is hugely disappointing because it’s not an honest discussion just an emotional one.

I don’t agree that mods are favouring any coins even if it appears that way, as you say. 

One thing you also need to be conscious of is both of the communities using sock puppet accounts to bait each other in those threads - or if one community links to the post and encourages brigading then it gets removed.

I have absolutely no issue with reading BCH news on the subreddit and I would encourage everyone here to post more of it - there’s obviously a certain sensitivity to the use of using the term “bitcoin” on both sides. Using the Ticker symbol seems to be the best way to avoid that argument. 

I’d really love both communities to rise above this all and contribute positively to the space..."
"Honestly there are very few coins that you can talk about on r/CC  and not get down voted.
Getting mad about it is pointless. As I have suggested here a few times just stop going to r/bitcoin and now r/cc  if your wanting to discuss coins that you know are disliked by the community in general. Yes it sucks but there are subs for all the specific coin we 
Use."
**THIS**
Brigading is literally against Reddit’s site wide policies - something that we try to enforce.
"I’m personally against mods displaying personal interest in controversial topics, however if our mods here are guilty, they’re guilty of one thing: their uncapped and unstoppable love for the Bitcoin which Satoshi Nakamoto created. I’ll forever excuse their (non-violent) actions when driven by that passion.

I think the only reason you see this post here is because historically the subreddit you mod have displayed obvious leaning towards the r/Bitcoin’s corporate-interest-driven narrative, often aiding their censorship efforts in silencing any info describing what Bitcoin Cash really is. 

And here I mean historically allowing obvious brigading from the rBitcoin puppet-army until it’s a pro-BCH post, then you falsely claim brigading as to snuff the post. 

We never brigade, we share the truth where it matters, with facts quoted right under it. And when finally something like that takes place and the slimy mods @ rBitcoin are exposed yet again, this time naked and in public, your mod team rushes to save them.  

Don’t take it personal, it’s Bitcoin that we care about, not personal drama. "
Every conspiracy needs a morsel of truth for the pushers to point to. 
"I can see how that was a mixed message sorry. I was referring to the idea the other guy has that fair moderation doesn’t exist - I personally don’t believe there is a large scale problem that requires an “audit” but I still encourage people to apply to join the team if they want to help out.

If your application is contingent on “proving that we have no hidden agenda” then you need not apply then. We already have public mod logs for that exact reason and honestly the subreddit doesn’t exist to appease conspiracy theorists. Thanks for the chat about it!"
Ok have you ever reported anything via modmail?
"Make up your mind, fella - one minute it's ""Come and apply to the join the team if you are so convinced there is a problem"", the next it's ""We don't need an audit"". Isn't that what joining the team was supposed to prove?

Anyway. You extended the offer, I accepted. I'd be doing both you and the conspiracy theorists a favour so I'm not going to jump through hoops for it. If you want to back down on joining your team as a way to prove you have no hidden agenda you only have to say so, I have no dog in this fight."

Also, the moderators have no duty to enforce any rules, even their own,  especially ones as stupid as linking to another sub and giving magical internet votes. No excuse.

Can it be considered brigading when a bunch of crypto currency enthusiasts go to the crypto currency subreddit to discuss crypto currency related things?
One of two possibilities exist: multiple communities are plotting against you in a vast coordinated conspiracy *or* your community thrives on conspiracy. 
Spending so much time in this sub the past few days has been a real eye opening experience for me. Thanking you for writing up this comment it’s absolutely the icing on the cake. 
"Or you know, a list of facts which you can’t refute so you come up with this bullshit.

No probs, thanks for clarifying.
Hi. What do you mean by that? Can we report a post removal? 
[deleted]
Again, what do you define as brigading? 
Thank you. 
"I’ve been looking through some old ccadmin threads, it’s almost as if we explained that the house clean up and account swap over was going to happen - it seemed best to do both at the same time especially given some of the doxxing events. Not everyone decided to do it either - look at jw’s account.

So this guy - we are satoshi mod is now complaining, accusing the team of suspicious behaviour, he fucking ignored the admin posts over the course of four weeks (four threads) and then we removed the low activity mods from the sub especially those that didn’t respond.

https://ibb.co/erwK7y
https://ibb.co/ioug4d
https://ibb.co/heNZPd

Also I can’t believe that guys in this subreddit  are capable of accepting that their own mod team can’t demonstrate impartial behaviour, yet it’s the exact thing they are accusing r/cc mods of. 

So look at who is creating these threads?... This mod team didn’t even try to reach out to chat with us or to verify any of the claims. This kind of moderating behaviour is just unheard of - I’ve never seen any active moderator personally try to attack the integrity of another subreddit in this way. Then when they pushed articles about us to bitcoin.com it completely crossed the line."
A single compromised account is irrelevant to doxxing and half a dozen other moderators. 
"If you have complaints, please use r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.

Even though the post mentions Monero, it clearly violates our rules to the point I feel completely comfortable removing it."
It’s common sense when you think about it more. Blockstream has one thing and one thing only they want to do: control Bitcoin. There are many ways to do this, with just one being social media manipulation. We’ve seen this for a few years now. It’s getting easier to spot now and is even more obvious. 
"I'm sorry but that's not really recommended for many reasons.

We're not r/btc - we may allow a few posts, but everyone already knows the situation over at r/bitcoin and having 10 threads a day is just going to make our sub another r/btc clone. Also it's hard to prove many of the things claimed since many users can lie about what they said/did and why the received a ban."

No, people think the mod team is paid when they're not.

You don't know which exact Reddit account it is though. The mod could have been removed by now, or any one of the current ones. It doesn't remove the link but it hinders it at a certain point.
"> Many moderators rotated their accounts

Can you reciprocate on accepting this as reasonable behaviour?

This is a recently rotated account, r\/bitcoin descended into censorship 3 years ago and I still went there for longer than a smart person would have, yet the cryptocurrency mods locking the thread say...

> *Many accounts didn't have profile activity r\/Bitcoin before commenting in that thread*

Of course they don't have activity on r\/bitcoin now - because they're the part of the r\/bitcoin community with first-hand experience of what OP asked about. They're the ideal people to have in that discussion, not the noobs still there who never noticed some of their comments disappear when not logged in with the account that  posted them."
It is now controlled by hardcore Litecoin and Monero People.
How does it feel putting your head in the sand everyday? Don't forget to clear your ears for infections. 
Don't forget the very obvious financial motives for doing such a thing. 
"I've never heard of that sub until now lol

It's pretty obvious we are not the same person. We're from different areas, active in different timezones, we write differently, we own different coins and have our own unique views on dealing with issues."
Why do these camps fight ? Why are people so exclusive and elitest and why do we not allow and discuss the positives and highlight possible negaitves on every chain. BTC and BCH both serve use cases and both develop at good rates . Unfortunate about Blockstream and the Consensorship. 
God damn who the fuck cares? You guys waste so much time worried about censorship. Grow the fuck up.
Ver is a POS and BCH is a shitcoin.
Enemies. Enemies everywhere... 
I figured mods would make new accounts or something.  But question everything
Not saying it isn't true but it also happens to be the most convenient thing to say for someone looking to co-opt a subreddit.  
"Coming across this thread was pretty hilarious to me, here's my take on it:

- I got asked to mod /r/cc about 6 months back. I originally said no, I didn't have the time and I had a lot on my plate. I would shitpost there a lot and report (a lot) of things. 2 months later they asked me again, so I said yes.
- When I got in, I had never seen such a mess. There was stuff in the modqueue that dated back 3 months (Literally, back into December, from February) . Stuff in Modmail that was 3 months old. Hundreds of modmails.  It was obvious something was wrong in terms of activity or something, I'd never seen anything like it.
- I ran a toolbox action for mod actions. [Here it is, minus the names for privacy](https://i.imgur.com/Ulzh8GP.png) - This is actions in the month I joined and the month beforehand.
- You'll notice there were **21 accounts with less than 100 actions in 2 months time.** 6 accounts which did 0, which is literally jack shit. One account was *suspended from Reddit*. The number on top is automod. Obviously there was a big inactivity problem.

So it's not really a nefarious plot. There were literally dozens of inactive people not doing a damn thing - The top moderators are inactive and are part of this group.

There are plenty of things to be paranoid about, including moderators wanting to push their agenda for a favoured coin of theirs, or people having permissions who delete only certain posts - Some of that's been dealt with in my short time here. They've gotten the boot and the behaviour's been corrected.

/r/cryptocurrency is a weird space. Literally everyone is trying to manipulate it in some way, for exposure, for pushing an agenda, or for whatever purpose they might have in mind. 

But there's really nothing nefarious going on behind the scenes. Lots of boring things, like explaining that people need 100 comment karma (because of shill accounts that attempt to shill nonstop every day) or canning vote manipulators that want to push the latest ICO onto people.

Just my 2 cents."
Don't know how this isn't getting mentioned, but attempts were made to dox the mods so they made new accounts. They have been transparent about this.
"The only solution is to keep creating more subreddits. Just the presence of alternatives goes a long way in keeping them honest. The moment they step out of line an exodus starts. Provided the place exists and has some presence already.  
r/warhammer once went to shit due to a terrible mod. It spawned countless other subreddits and they're all vibrant communities now.   "
Red pill these jokers! u/tippr gild 
I believe it's of the utmost importance for the mods here to make steps to move the community to a forum they can't be kicked from. Just see what's happening to Twitter and r/cryptocurrency.
Burn Alert!! 
Very likely.
"Its most likely taken over by a combination of Monero and Bitcoin maximalists. Notice how the Monero related mod goes on a rampage banning posts of every other privacy coin 

Innovation really takes a backseat to petty politics on reddit."
So you think people *conspired* to do something that is both not illegal and potentially very profitable?   Tinfoil hats, lizard people, etc
How is this even possible for someone to buy the name to a subreddit even though it's hosted on Reddit's servers?
"Well, we need to do something about this. I usually don't care about how newbies are duped but this system is flawed. These guys are promoting Bitcoin Core & doing the bidding of big banks and their rich donors. This is pure market manipulation and would be considered a crime in by SEC for stocks. 

**Do we need another platform? Since even Reddit mods seem to have turned a blind eye towards these moderation abuses and outright censorship by these subreddit?**"
"You haven't even commented on r/CC until 3 days ago and are saying without certainty that it's ""purchased."" I would beseech you to either prove the validity of your claims before making them or alter them altogether.

We have no restrictions on posting about Bitcoin Cash whether positive or negative as long as it follows the rules."
The hate for BCH in that sub is notorious 
I've been a mod for over a year now (almost two?). I came on board to implement the price ticker thing in the header. Near the end of last year all mods below the top two were removed to clean up and reorder and allow people that wanted to a chance to swap accounts (I did not, this is my only non-bot Reddit account). This is why it looks like everyone below top two started at the same time.
"> Yes. And let's all keep in mind it's a possibility. There's a lot of relatively strong circumstantial evidence pointing towards it being the case, but it isn't looking like an absolute just yet.

*wink*"
"Dude after I've now seen 3 threads recently created about it... and wow this one was even created by the BCH mod team (leading by example right?) - the truth is purposely being ignored.

I've even posted some more information about the doxxing which received massive downvoting...

I have no idea how they managed to do that but some people are just insane. Unfortunately a few users here also love trying to turn everything into a conspiracy."
I didn't say anything about a conspiracy
/s in case you can’t tell
"""Hey guys im the same mod as before but because im a new account my doxxed info cant be connected to this account"" is what tgat sounds like, which is just silly.

If you don't want a doxxed account associated with you, then you shouldn't confirm that your prior account was the one doxxed "
I'll check it out tonight for you - There's a *lot* of modmails so sometimes they go through the cracks.
But how do we know they are real humans?
Furthermore, the r/btc moderator who posted this is a \*paid employee\* of Roger Ver.
Look at how vehemently they're doing damage control! Where there's smoke, there's fire, and if you're taking flak THEN YOU ARE OVER THE TARGET.
The post is locked, but it shows the comments. You can see it's actually against r/bitcoin. I'm not saying it's right to lock the thread but.. was there much to add to the thread anyway? I don't see it as appalling censorship
"No you didn't, you just described the dictionary definition of conspiracy - to make secret plans.  My point is that calling ""conspiracy"" is often done to ridicule and shut down an argument.  In fact, I saw people doing  this when this exact subject was discussed on Twitter.   But in actuality, it's pretty dumb to think people wouldn't do something legal and profitable just because it is a bit immoral."
"How do I know it hasn’t been bought? Because we have public modlogs and constantly chat on discord. If I’ve ever seen things that don’t look right I chat with those mods and if necessary remove them from the team. With that being said I don’t monitor everything all the time, we have a bunch of mods who checkin to make sure things are running smoothly.

We don’t even have a donations address for crying out loud. "
"It' the guy that offered that narrative on a silver plate. He actually tried to buy the /r/Bitcoin sub two times, the most recent one two days ago, offering 250k. So it's not impossible to think that he did the same with the twitter account (while in fact he probably did).

Where's the conspiracy here? "
"You have an answer for everything. I’m impressed. I’ve entertained some crackpot theories in this subreddit, this is by far the weakest.

I talk to the mods everyday via discord. Sorry mate you’ll have to try harder."
"Wait did he monero kid ban you for posting about a potential competitor? 

Wow way to keep things fair and transparent. 

He just told me its ""clearly violates"" a rule however I cant for fucks sake find how posting about another coin will ""clearly violate"" anything. . "
Great way of not putting all the information in and only pasting in what you liked...... <applause>
"I can’t see a reason why and the telegram is using no participation links. I’ll re-activate the post until another mod can tell me why.

Edit: Exchange listings are considered low quality posts it’s in the subreddit rules. Sorry.

A note should have been left on the post I’ll let the mod know."
It seems you have inside knowledge, could you share with us why the Bitcoin censorship thread was removed? You know, the one that contained a comment (which was removed too) that presented all of Blockstream's anti-Bitcoin actions.
I love a good conspiracy! it's what made DeusEx amazing.
Probably misunderstanding something, but why did you need to create new accounts because of that one account?

They're controlled by accounts
It's more pathetic that everyone assumes we're paid off when really we turn down all offers and have never been paid 1 cent to mod. If a mod finds out another mod is getting paid then we remove them since that's a gross breach of ethics.
That pretty much proves they felt it was worth it on r/bitcoin, as they are replicating their actions. The experiment was a success.
Probably because it would be too obvious so you just created this sock account 8 months ago.

It doesnt fall under any of this.  



Be real, you just censored it because it doesnt align with your priorities. 

Im not gonna visit a 2 bit meta sub. Nobody except new comers even visit the CC because it has turned into such a disaster and a highly censored places to discuss cryptocurrency. Just came across the mod controversy in BitcoinMarkets"
Where's your proof?
"I wouldn't say 'they' have dug their heels in. The software (thus the coin/network) was called bitcoin from the beginning. I call it bitcoin to avoid confusion.

In regards to your dollar example, it's a actually  good example against your naming conventions. Believe it or not the US dollar is not The dollar, the original dollar come from Joachim's valley/dale (German translation) from the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia. Their coin was named after this valley, which got shortened to 'talor' (English translation being dollar). The first major copy was the Dutch 'lion daler'.

And here is the important point: the Dutch gave it there own name be appending 'lion', just like what bitcoin cash did with the 'cash'. The original Czech talor (dollar) never changed their name as they didnt need too.

As a side note I like the fact that there is hundreds of versions of the Bitcoin Core software and Bitcoin ABC is one of its many new children. It's the beauty of open source software."
"Right. So everything that humans produce is made on the back of other things that humans have produced. The English language and the alphabet and everything else has roots in other things that have roots in other things. You are glad that there are many versions of bitcoin now. As am I. But your argument is what again exactly? That Bitcoin Cash shouldn't be called ""Bitcoin"" Cash? 
Or is your main point only that the BTC chain should forever and always be only ""bitcoin""? Where is this Bohemian dollar now? Is the original no more? What is your stance on other countries also using the word ""dollar"" in their name? Does it bother you that they need to have a distinction when the context is not clear? I will trade you some dollars for dollars? Or is it just best to stick to ticker symbols?"
"Well ticker symbols can also get mixed up and are no sure fire way. Bitcoin 2x made a concerted effort to take BTC ticker but failed. Also remember the BCC Bitcoin Cash/Bitconnect mix up. I actually think binance still lists Bitcoin Cash as Bitconnect.

Im happy there are many versions of Bitcoin Core software (not the Bitcoin network), see the difference? I think we have had this talk before about the software/network differential.

All dollars now are differentiated by country prefix which is perfectly fine. The original dollar is no more because the old centralised money is attached to nation states (when was the last time you heard the 
Kingdom of Bohemia come up in the news? :) ).

So to summarise my points, there is no requirement to rename Bitcoin as Bitcoin Cash is differentiated by appending 'cash' to its name. If we were to follow your renaming conventions we would be changing the names of our networks/tokens nearly every week.

BTW: I will happily trade you as many Australian dollars for your US dollars (1:1), and by the by, accept as many of your Bitcoin for each Bitcoin Cash I have. 


"
"I will not be conducting and trade with someone who does not like Oreos. That is a moral line I simply can not cross. 
Tickers get mixed up less often. Especially when it is still only a few outliers that use outdated symbols. *sigh* yes........ again, I am aware of the difference between the core team and the core implementation and apple cores. Clearly I have not expressed my opinion on why the BTC chain having a unique identifier would help prevent newbs from making mistakes which seems to be your main concern. I apologize for failing you. While there is no requirement, and I have never said there is. I think it would be helpful. You have expressed the same point several times that btc would have to continue to change its name with every fork which makes 0 sense to me. It seems we have both failed. "
"> Do you think looking at github commit records is a good way of... 

github is a good way of judging how active and diverse a coding community is. just look at the bitcoin abc repo to see what i mean: 

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/graphs/contributors?from=2017-02-15&to=2018-06-09&type=c

> ... the opinion leaders ...

yes? all of them are highly skilled people and i really value their opinion. so does a big part of the community. you obviously don't, which is ok, but that doesn't grant you the right to spread conspiracy theories. why are you not participating in the technical discourse instead? 

> You can't just ignore this connection and claim that Blockstream, Core, and BTC development are not closely linked.

yes, nobody denies that. but what is the problem? bitmain chose to support bitcoin cash development, fine for me. i don't see why companies shouldn't fund development of opensource technologies. 

> He said ""of course we're not going to keep developing everything for free""... 

you don't say! a company that is planing to earn money! scandal! ;-) 

> their profit model is dependent on the BTC chain retaining a small blocksize. This is an overt conflict of interest

on the contrary, it is crucial for the bitcoin network to stay decentralized. blockstream, among many other companies, is committed to that goal. i'm very happy to see all the work done on layer 2 technologies because those are the future of scaling. you can go ahead with your on-chain approach, but you will come to realize that the logical consequence will be master nodes, controlled by a centralized mining cartel. good bye fungibility and censorship resistance! "
"Thanks for your response. I'm not out to crucify anyone, I just say what I see.

>why are you not participating in the technical discourse instead?

Where did you get that idea? Several times per week I explain to people why Lightning likely will never work and/or won't be adopted. It's not a hate thing, it's just reality. In 2 years everyone will know this, but right now only technical people can evaluate claims and make empirical observations. As an intelligent person you should probably consider that LN's failure is the likely outcome.

Sidechains are totally unnecessary and unproven technology. Thousands of altcoins exist, and they are already performing the function that sidechains were intended for, and they're far less complicated and leverage the existing exchange infrastructure. When the BTC blocks got full, fees got high, and transactions wouldn't confirm, the laws of economics kicked in. BTC dropped to below 40&#37; dominance from 98&#37; in 6 months because the dev team was compromised. And it will keep falling as more and more merchants ditch BTC. Blockstream and the Core devs have NO PUBLIC SPOKESPERSON. They simply can't admit their real plan (but Adam Back pretty much did in the Forbes article, and Samson Mao seemed very nervous when things got real).

Bitmain supported BCH devs with money. That's different from Blockstream taking over the existing Core dev team, roadmap, and infrastructure, then isolating and driving out all of the original members one by one.

>it is crucial for the bitcoin network to stay decentralized. blockstream, among many other companies, is committed to that goal.

Sorry but that is a talking point that really has been debunked so many times.  A corporation that makes patented products to ""scale"" on top of a network that they've deliberately crippled is hardly a ""commitment to decentralization"".  And there is no metric to measure decentralization, it's rather mystical if you think about it. The only resource that has even attempted such a task is [https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/](https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/)

... which concludes that BTC and BCH are roughly equally decentralized. Ripple stands out as incredibly centralized, as any technical person already knows, given that they're simply printing ""Funbux"" without any mining or equitable distribution.

Thanks for reading."
Ok man I guess you're playing dumb then 
No one in the mod team is being banned? That’s what I don’t understand dude
I’ve been a mod on other accounts. You don’t want to leave mods on that have been inactive. At some random point the account can be hijacked or the mod just have a feeling to cause destruction. Wouldn’t be the first time.
lol. ok. i mean, if you think about this logically and take it at its face, inactive accounts on a subreddit as big as cc are a security risk. 
"Inactive is all a relative term.  You can argue that if major changes are happening to the userbase due to explosive growth and major changes in policies... perhaps a semi-active mod might not be up to speed with the rest of the moderator team.

Still, somebody who is checking in on a regular basis can act as a check on those who are doing the heavy lifting and might be a tad bit overzealous.

I've been a moderator on some pretty big forums before, and my experience is that in almost every case where you toss out moderators due to low activity is usually trouble and the minor annoyance that can come from somebody inactive to back in full activity usually can be cleaned up quite quickly compared to kicking out people who still have a whole lot to contribute.

The very minor issue of somebody hacking into the account of an inactive moderator is just that:  something so rare that it isn't worth bothering to deal with and can usually be cleaned up quickly too.  I'm not going to say it doesn't happen, but it isn't nearly the issue it is often made out to become.

Inactivity at best is something that should be measured in years, not days or weeks."
"*I don't want people doing free work for me because they don't do enough free work for me*

Yeah.. Okay mate. "
And it's just a happy accident that everything turned out exactly as you, Theymos, would have liked.
Because they literally don’t join in any discussion or help us. They aren’t interested anymore. It’s not a healthy morale for the team.
LOL okay mate jog on
"Can you even imagine how much stuff we have to deal with?...

That’s fine you don’t have to agree with it, but also you don’t see all the work required in the backend. Surely you can understand that.

We pretty much only do clean of house every six months and render a mod matrix looking for low activity. Everyone has the opportunity to stay on or leave if they can’t commit to helping out in some capacity.

Given that you aren’t part of this process I feel like you are being extremely unreasonable."
A lot of people can tell you're lying, apparently. 
It’s literally happened to us - so it’s an issue for us obviously not for you. 
Seriously guys did he even read my post?  I know exactly what you are dealing with because I've done it before.  
"What did I say that is wrong? I’m happy to help
you... "
"Are you joking now? This is only done every six months and everyone has the opportunity to stay or leave if they can’t commit to helping out in some capacity. Why does everything single internal process have to explained to you? Nothing is being done in bad faith and I can see that the guys here are desperately looking for something to hold against us. 

Dude at least we are communicating with communities and have public modlogs that’s way more than I can say for other problem crypto subreddits..."
What is your problem?
Wow, I just read his reply to me. How did you know?
I don't believe you are acting in good faith 
I've been a moderator on far larger projects than this subreddit.  This is from decades of experience.
"Okay let’s try something - please make a post about Dash if there is news. DM it to me personally and let’s see what happens? I honestly don’t believe there is a mod campaign to censor dash. However, I do believe that other communities have been known to go out of their way to downvote each others posts. We see it with the Ve chain and Walton chain all the time. Been trying to ask both of those communities to tone it down because we want to encourage News of all forms. 

I do want to help you out if you will be patient and civil. You can always DM me with questions on reddit or via discord."
He's not going to answer in good faith.  You might get a vague, self-contradictory denial from /u/crypto_buddha, but the second you press him for details he breaks character.
"We have an internal discussion and vote which they can participate in... it makes it easier when they just ignore it like every other discussion...

Obviously if they commit to being more involved then there’s no issues."
Well if you're honestly looking for a space to discuss news and promote crypto do me a favor and type 'Dash' into the r/cryptocurrency search bar. Then please explain to me why only threads that are FUD threads have any comments or upvotes, while any positive news has 0 comments and nearly 0 upvotes? Do you really think that nobody cares that Dash say has over 1000+ businesses that accept it? With 120+ of those being in Venezuela? That sounds newsworthy, yet every time its posted about on your sub, its completely barren. Can you explain that?
And did you contact them to ask if they are still wanting to be involved, or do you just purge them? 
"It is a minor issue due to its extreme rarity, and the fact that it is also extremely easily caught.  Even here on Reddit, anything done can almost always be undone too, and cleaning up after a single bad actor isn't that hard either.

As I said, a non-issue.  You just don't grasp how little of a problem it really is and somebody hacking into a mod account is almost never going to happen either.  It is also just as likely to happen to an active mod account."
Yep it really hit a nerve sorry
You literally asked me why the mod team is being banned how does that make any sense? That’s why I’ve been trying to clarify what you mean by ban. No we aren’t banning people from the mod team Jesus Christ 
What communities did you mod? I imagine modding /r/cryptocurrency is _a lot_ of work, considering the monetary incentives involved and the general bad dialogue between vocal communities in crypto. Unless you were modding a similar size subreddit you probably don't know what the /r/cc mods are dealing with.
"On what scale just out of curiosity?  and did you have to deal with competing communities all under one roof? 

"
No that’s how it works in our team.
"I don’t have anything to lie about. Another mod posted a screenshot of the low activity mod matrix in this thread. It’s concerning if we have accounts with 10 or less activity over a period of months. 

Quite often we get mods that just fizzle our after initially doing some work."
"You guys:

- inactive mod accounts must be sockpuppets 

- let mod inactive accounts stay on the team!

Jesus Christ "
"How is hacking a mod account a minor issue? We’ve had one account comprised and he used the opportunity to post referral links to the sidebar during a very busy period. It was identified and sent to reddit to be swiftly dealt with.

I’m sorry but reading through all your points it
seems you just don’t have any insight or proper grasp on the challenges that may or may not be unique to r/cc"
"If people are involved in discussions even just once per month we aren’t going to ask them to leave that would be ridiculous. 

The cleanup occurs every six months and is measured in months not days or weeks.

If we just get mods with radio silence then we can’t have them as part of the team it’s really simple."
"From:
>The hostility in your approach isn’t helping the dialogue between us.

To:
>Go fuck yourself. I’ve had enough of your bullshit now.

Well, that escalated *quickly* :D"

The mod team has mod privs. Clearly I don’t understand your question sorry
Your edit is because your comment has been linked in other subs. Obvious brigading by outraged sheeple.
I've moderated things before, and I've seen such house cleaning.  I still think it's bs.  Maybe not a conspiracy, but probably a bad idea.  Especially if the new mods are all new accounts. 
Come on man you're just avoiding the question 
Ah you're right. That is time as mod not Reddit lifespan. My apologizes.
"Hes certainly lying. I was a mod at the time and inactive mods were removed as old mod accounts had been hacked. He was inactive, he was asked to chime in to thread asking mods to be more active and didn't. all mods of x age and over were not removed. Thats crazy.

The subreddit has problems for sure, but what hes saying isnt what happened."
Calling someone who disagrees with your a troll. That's exactly what they do at r/bitcoin!
"Because you don’t know which accounts are linked to each other. It’s changed up. 

There are also obviously new mods since this was done."
Being a mod is hard work. You'd have to be paid to do a lot of it. Oh... hang on a minute!
"I just checked.   There are 22 mods plus the automod.    The average age of their accounts is 42 months.   ""Accounts less than 7 mo""  <- to this you're referring not to their accounts' reddit age, rather to their time as mod on r/cryptocurrency, correct?    

Two of the mods, u/seasonfinale and u/stardigrada have been mods there for many years, but you're right a whole lot of new mods starting about 7mo ago.   

Perhaps those older mods might care to explain what transpired? "
It's less effort to downvote you than it is to respond reasonably to your genuine attempt at trolling, so that's what I will do. 
huh?
"> This is only done every six months and everyone has the opportunity to stay or leave if they can’t commit to helping out in some capacity.

So you asked if he wants to help out anymore, and then he said no, and **then** you removed him?

Or...did you just remove him "
Thanks for sharing 
"There is a huge difference between the scientific consensus in support of vaccines and the minority support of BCH in the crypto community by both users and experts in the field. That was quite the illogical leap you made there. The BCH community looks a lot more like the Antivax community than the BTC does to most people that don't know the whole story. The communities are mirror image of each other. I see the same ""the subs are the same fallacy"" argument on r/bitcoin all the time. If you're too blinded to see that you need to take a step back because it's hurting your cause."
Please kindly show me u/crypto_buddha bias and hypocritical behaviour 
An inactive mod is a good mod.
"> unfortunately you can't really have any pro-BTC or anti BCH talk here without being attacked and down-voted though

The classic ""both sides are equally bad"" fallacy comparing downvotes to censorship.  First, it's important to establish that downvotes here have very little to do with supporting different opinions.  I'd challenge you to find some examples of what you claim.

From what I've seen, people downvote BTC comments that are made in bad faith or make false claims.  The same way anti-vaccer comments get downvoted in pro-science subs.  Genuine questions or evidence-backed claims, regardless of conclusion, tend to contribute to the conversation and get up

It's not because the pro-science people are all just biased and unbalanced against other opinions on vaccines.  It's because the anti-vax people are wrong.  And their arguments are wrong.  Some because they're lying, some because they lack the ability to differentiate reality from fiction, and some because they're simply misinformed.  In you're in the latter category, you'll get plenty of balanced, factual, evidence-based expert advice and opinion on BTC and BCH without hostility or downvotes.  In you're in the former groups, you'll probably just complain about bias and seek out the anti-vax bubbles for ""more balance""."
That's true, and what's not hidden is now being used to document their blatant bias and hypocritical behavior.
"I don't like censorship, but Dash is a major scam with its huge fastmine *cough* premine . The founder still has 256,000 coins which is a huge percentage of the current supply.

XMR I don't like much due to its inflationary nature and developer ties with BlockStream. Also the fees are way too high.

Bitcoin and Litecoin's only hope is Lightning Network which will end up being a centralised fully trackable shitshow."

What do you mean by ban?
"There are multiple reasons why this isn’t great for the team.

- security
- morale
- team discussions
- voting on changes

It’s the cause of much frustration when we have people who are actually putting in time and effort and others who don’t give a shit. Take a step back  from all the conspiracy stuff in this thread and think about it."
I’m trying not to be blunt about it, while everyone is clutching at straws until they have something to use against us. Don’t want to feed the paranoia   instead providing clarity... which is not being received very well here.
"If they have low activity for months there’s no point in having them on the team. 

Sorry that doesn’t fit with your narrative."
What did you disagree with me on? 
Why because old inactive mod accounts had been hacked before leading to ref links being secretly placed in the sidebar, and he was an inactive mod? Sounds like you've never had any experience moderating a subreddit with over half a million people in it. 
"I have to side with the mods on this one. I was an active mod at the time. Not only was there a month + notice about the vote to check in, /u/We_are_all_satoshi was notified about it and still did not respond (he really didnt do much modding anyway, he was largely absent). 

>Why on earth would you remove mods for nothing but low activity?

Because inactive mod accounts have been hacked before. Its part of the reason I stepped down, I was becoming an absent mod and I was tired of having my accounts constantly having attempts made on them, my gmail accounts, etc. So then the sidebar got hacked and all the exchange links replaced to ref links, and then a mod got hacked again.

So why remove mods for low activity? In this subreddit its a straight up security risk."
"To clean up spam and act as a check on abuse.  

Why on earth would you remove mods for nothing but low activity?"
"Well, I'm not sure if the distinction matters.   Certainly they didn't stack it with a bunch of brand new accounts.   It doesn't mean it didn't get stacked with partisans.   

Would be genuinely interested to hear from u/seasonfinale and u/stardigrada as to the backstory of what happened 7mo ago..."
"Sorry, should read ""who you disagree with"""

Why wouldn't you?  It's not like there's some disadvantage to having extra mods that aren't as active.  If the account is inactive or compromised i guess that's something else. 
"He was given multiple pings over a course of weeks. This happened around 227 days ago.

He didn’t respond in any of the threads discussing the in house cleanup. Multiple moderators commented on it and those who did either stayed or voluntarily left because they couldn’t commit to helping out any more."
You said when are we going to restore the mod privs? I have no idea where this is coming from.
"So at what point does it become ok to ban someone then? 3 months?

6 months?

Where is the threshold?"
You don't seem to understand the distinction between legal and non-legal.
I'm speaking about the moral side of it.
