"Talks about BCH have been cleared because the reddit is dedicated to Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash.  There is no such moderation happening in /r/btc because one of the moderators has business interests in BCH and uses the channel to market those services.  /r/btc actually censors topics that expose the cognitive dissonance of the subreddit's focus on BCH instead of BTC.  Guys like you then attack people who point it out like youve been doing over the last day.

If you want to talk about all cryptocurrencies, do it in /r/cryptocurrency or /r/cryptocurrencytrading which covers bitcoin and all alt coins.

If I went into /r/nbalive to talk about NBA2k, theyd bump those comments too.  Ya know why?  They dont belong there in the first place.  It's off topic.

The fact is /r/BTC should be focused on BTC, not BCH.  You certainly should not be misleading people by confusing BCH and BTC and selling services that focus on BCH in a subreddit named BTC.

Core is a group of developers programming the original bitcoin client.  It's not a bunch of private business owners with their own financial interests like BCH.  The market and the rest of the community have called BTC the legacy Bitcoin chain but its you guys in /r/BTC selling BCH that make the community look shady and scammy.

I dont care that you support BCH.  I own some myself.  What I care about is using /r/BTC to do it.  /r/BTC should be about BTC, not BCH.  Whats happening in that subreddit is fraud.  BCH should be in a subreddit about BCH not hijacking the subreddit for BTC."

"Yes, the central claim of the paper is that when this inevitably happens, Bitcoin is not stable *unless* there is a continual backlog of transactions (with accompanying fees) waiting to be processed. Without such a backlog, the rational (most profitable) mining strategy becomes to ""re-mine"" any block that managed to capture meaningful fees, *rather than building on top of it and extending the chain*.

In other words, when the block reward diminishes to a small enough value (**which is 100% inevitable by design**), it stops providing sufficient incentives to reliably grow the blockchain. Satoshi's answer to this problem was ""transaction fees will provide this incentive"" but the paper demonstrated that they can only reliably do so if *the mempool regularly contains a backlog of pending transactions with meaningful fees attached*.

I recommend actually reading the paper, rather than just glancing through it. It is a seminal work. "
"It started as people simply proposing ways to upgrade Bitcoin; it only became a fork much later when it became clear Core would not allow Bitcoin to be upgraded."
"Core has allowed upgrades.  They just didnt allow the upgrades the BCH crowd argued for.  So they went ahead with the fork and the markets and community didnt support their alt coin.  It failed on the open market and the rest of the community didnt have faith in it either.

Roger Ver is a convicted criminal.
OK sounds like you have it all worked out. So you know about Bitcoin Cash, that's good, sounds like it suits your idea of what Bitcoin should be. There are many different scaling proposals and they all have drawbacks and downsides. Bigger blocks is just one. I don't know better than Bitcoin's developers. If you think you do, that's just incredibly arrogant, but you might be right. We'll see. All the best.
"I am not exactly sure what ""artificially high fees"" means, or how we could define ""artificial"" objectively in that context, so... no, I am not trying to argue that.

The paper shows that a backlog of pending, fee-paying transactions in the mempool is a sign of *health* in the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin works because of how the economic incentives are aligned. Miners' greed allows the network to function autonomously. It would be wonderful if we could achieve everything that Bitcoin achieves through sheer altruism, but that's not a realistic assumption to rely upon, unfortunately.

I apologize for assuming you hadn't read the paper, your comments and responses so far led me to that (apparently mistaken) impression. Thank you for correcting me."

Isn't BCH the original plan of Bitcoin before Blockstream? This is what I thought based on my past experiences with Bitcoin pre-blockstream. 

I read the article. Man that is a fast article following what happened today. It is informative and eye opening if true. I have to take a step back and do some research before I take in believe what it say. I do have to ask this though, near the end it says:

> Oh no, I’m losing an argument. Look over there CENSORSHIP!

the article implying that BigBlockers do this. I can only say that this is half-true as I have yet to see a solid argument for SmallBlocks. This is what I was asking you and my conclusion down below. If it is a simple argument and you can post the details real quickly then you would save me some hassle, but ayways...


>You are asking me a question that had months of debate and the outcome was a split with both sides thinking their truth is the truth. I don't think I can convince you in post while months of debate on both subs failed....

How is Bitcoin Core censorship resistant if poor people get all their transactions censored?
"> I've never said any of these things.

I think he's saying his actions are not within what would be expected of someone that is simply a neutral moderator.
I think you're misrepresenting the point. In general, one cannot discuss the censorship by /r/bitcoin on /r/bitcoin without your posts being grey listed, along with various other topics (it even happened to me today). One example of a post containing the word does not disprove that.
"If you are serious about disclosing internal moderation policies (which you almost certainly are not), you could open up the mod logs as a first step.

And maybe you can't.

"People ridiculously dirt poor typically a) don't have money to be sending around all willy nilly.... duh, and b) most likely don't have the technology access for transactions with any sort of frequency anyway... duh.

How does this work? I know of bitcoin but how does this work with that? Does it keep a balance of money and you can tip people with it?

Why does poor automatically mean 3rd world to you? Why doesn't it mean people in developing countries that transfer money regularly to and from developed countries?

That is very interesting. BTC is heavily censored but you say it is against that?
Bitcoin Cash is **a** Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Cash is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core though.
Again, I don't deny Core's propaganda efforts have been quite effective.
">Your argument says nothing about the current case, when mining rewards don't have to be dominated by transaction fees.

About 80% of **all BTC that will ever exist** have already been mined. When do you believe the transition to a fee-centric paradigm should begin, at what rate should the transition occur, and do you have any formal academic analysis to support your reasoning?

I am happy to hear out any long-term plans that people have in mind, but in my experience they usually don't have *any* other than ""Let's just think of the short term for now, and cross the other bridges as they come!"" If you are the exception, if you've put actual thought into this and have meaningful arguments for what you think the timetables should look like on how this all plays out, I'm all ears. I suspect this isn't the case, though.

I really, **really** recommend reading [The Hardest Logic Puzzle In The World](https://xkcd.com/solution.html) and spending a good amount of time making sure you understand the answer and why it is the answer. I promise that it is not irrelevant to our discussion here, and you don't have to do it right now or anything.

Efficient markets (at least should) work like the logicians in that puzzle, in that *if* something will be worth a certain value at a certain point in the future, and this can be known (and demonstrated) with certainty, the price will converge on that value *in the present*. Or, to be more accurate, the price will converge on a value in the present which reflects that future value after you factor in the time value of money (but that's not particularly important for the point at hand). This means that *if* Bitcoin would suddenly stop working in 2140, and the whole thing breaks down, and we can logically realize this today, then its value should go to zero *starting now*.

That's why it was important for Satoshi to specify an incentive that exists even when the coinbase rewards vanish (or drop to negligible levels): transaction fees. It is an elegant solution, and seems to give us a means for Bitcoin to continue working for as far as you care to extrapolate forward (at least, *a priori*).

So you can't simply say ""We have the block rewards now, let's not worry about fees while they are still 'pretty big' because we don't have to."" We *do* have to. And we're rapidly approaching the point where big block rewards are no longer a given.

>Bitcoin has the power to change that.

I'm the most optimistic person I know, and I certainly hope you're right, but ""Don't worry, Bitcoin is magic!"" isn't a good enough argument to convince most people or convince the market.

I'm not trying to make a strawman argument here, by the way. It really does seem like you're saying ""Bitcoin has powers we don't understand."" It's an argument based on an appeal to magic, as far as I can see.

>Whenever people make the argument that ""this cannot work because it requires people to not act selfishly"" or similar, it implies 1 of 2 things: 1) a defeatist attitude about the inherent goodness of man or 2) they themselves want to act selfishly. Which of these are you?

I think this is a false dichotomy, but if you force me to choose, I choose 1. 

Bitcoin is built so that it survives *even in adversarial conditions*, and it achieves this by relying on the inherent greed of Man. That's the beauty of it, in fact. Once you start trying to remove this quality of it, you are *trying to weaken Bitcoin* and effectively trying to reduce it from antifragile to fragile.

I, for one, will oppose that effort with all of my might. "

"That was *not* actually the point in the OP. The point here was actually that this *never* happens in /r/Bitcoin, and that they have *never* seen a *single* instance of a comment being allowed which contained such a word. Therefore, when they saw a visible comment containing that word in the analyzed thread, they concluded that the only possible explanation for this was a carefully orchestrated malicious false flag campaign by the moderators.

I have explained that *not only do other examples exist* (and provided a quick example *off the top of my head* to prove this), but that *there is another explanation that OP very deliberately neglected to consider*, which is that approved submitters (like 4n4n4) are not caught in any filters by default. They even go on to discuss that *they know 4n4n4 is an approved submitter*, many paragraphs later, which contradicts the claim made in their first paragraph.

It does not seem that you have understood the arguments in the OP nor the refutations that I have made. Do you appreciate the contradiction that I am pointing out?

Interesting, but not terribly surprising. This is not something most people in this subreddit want to hear, I'd imagine.

I never actually ran BIP148 software myself, mainly because I didn't think my doing so was ever going to have a meaningful impact. I did root for the movement (mostly silently), though, and the most ""extreme"" my support ever got was chiming in to a couple of reddit arguments to point out the continual successes of flag-day SegWit soft-fork activations (a la BIP148) in coins like Vertcoin and Litecoin, and ridiculing misunderstandings regarding the conflation of ""the backing of the economic majority"" with ""total UASF-signaling node count"" (which I always considered a particularly stupid strawman argument).

OP's a core developer so I'm sure he's not talking shit. Anyway, Bitcoin is a high fee environment at the moment because transactions are happening on-chain and the block-size is limited. OP was saying it's not a technical problem if the mempool is huge, he wasn't talking about it not being an attribute to high fees. The plan to scale bitcoin is to kick payments up a layer or two. If you are using bitcoin for payments on the blockchain level (your only option at the moment) then I agree, fees are two high for it to be practical for low payments. Also blocks take on average 10 minutes to confirm. It's a pretty slow and shitty payment system if you have to wait 10 minutes. Sometimes a lot more. Come back in a year or three when some new layers are rolled out, they ought to be instant and practically free. For now bitcoin is a good but highly experimental store of value.

If the mempool is increasing then most wallets don't pay enough fees.  
On BCH many wallets are overpaying because it was just ported from BTC.

"Yes you can:

> **Is opt-in RBF only useful for adjusting fees?**

> No, another useful thing wallets can do with opt-in RBF is combine two or payments into a single payment when the first payment hasn’t confirmed yet. This can save a large number of bytes and transaction fees even though the replacement will have pay a higher fee than the original.

https://bitcoincore.org/en/faq/optin_rbf/

The subtext of them saying the RBF is no more dangerous than 0-conf transactions is that 0-conf transactions can always be replaced by another, spending the same inputs.

Even though you may have trouble relaying the second one, you could positively use a transaction accelerator to double-spend.

If you expect the transaction to be confirmed next block, there is no benefit cheating just for coffee.

"
"By the sender, Not the receiver.
So let's call the scenario of a store that accepts bitcoin but only if it is not a RBF transaction, as ""RBF opt-in"". What should the store-clerk then tell the customer when a transaction with RBF enabled is sent anyway. ""I'm sorry sir, we won't be able to accept your transaction with RBF enabled, you need to resend without RBF (and by the way I don't know what this means)""

Not very usable now is it?"

">* Congested block chain due to arbitrary 1 MB block size imposed by BlockStream.

*Imposed by Satoshi, not lifted by the majority of miners/nodes/businesses/users.

Bitcoin is open source, you don't need Blockstream to write the code change, as you can see with the existence of Bitcoin Cash. The reason the limit is in place is because the majority of the network is keeping it that way.

>* Bitcoin added Replace By Fee (RBF), meaning a merchant needs to wait for 1 confirmation

Or simply not accept RBF transactions. "
"The max block size is neither 1MB, arbitrary, or imposed by Blockstream.

0 for 3, not bad.

Transactions that can be replaced by fee have a flag, so merchants can just require confirmations for RBF transactions.

But it's not like I would expect a Bitcoin Cash supporter to be anything other than marvelously ignorant."
https://youtu.be/ienp4J3pW7U
i had to pay that much to use bitcoin in a crippled form earlier, in two blocks said electrum, would of been double to get it moved sooner.
Unfortunately people have to plan assuming at best average fees, which have been up to 20 bucks in the past couple weeks. Wildly unpredictable fees themselves stymie use cases. If 9/10 times fees are 1 penny and 1/10 times it’s an average of 20 bucks (meaning a good portion are even higher) I can’t rely on it for small transactions. 
Look again at the fees in a few days...
That isn't true. The money never got sent, it doesn't get refunded. The transaction will stay in the mempool as long as the sending node broadcasts it.
"""Or simply use [whatever coin is pumping on coinmarketcap today]."""
Well, we ended up with the conclusion that neither BTC nor BCH fit this usecase, neither would either be usefull for any in-shop purchases even if you could guarantee falling withing the next block.  There's plenty of room for 2 cryptos to exist if they solve different problems
Link?  Because I am wondering what merchants would ever wait 10 minutes.   10 mins vs 24 hours makes no difference when buying coffee,  imo.
"""Groundbreaking"" ha ha ha good one."
I worked for a merchant provider.  It's protocols in place that stop your spending.  Don't spread FUD people.
"You are incorrect, your credit card checks your balance _before_ allowing transaction to even be scheduled - visa is basically a lightning network, or a smart contract.

However this check might as well be called confirmation, since that's exactly what it is. That being said - bitcoin confirmations are __more__ than just confirmations - they are ledger entries. While Visa confirms then enters everything to the ledger at the end of the day, bitcoin does both at the same time. This is why empty/light blocks or whatever it's called now can be great future for bitcoin - this would allow visa like confirmation which is not as safe as bitcoin confirmation but safe enough for small payments where people would be willing to take small risk and where gaming the system is not worth it."
"This is from your perspective, not the merchants. The Visa transaction isn't really ""confirmed"" in the Bitcoin sense until the money has actually transferred to the merchants account, and depending on how you want to count that, that'll be anywhere from a day to 90 days (in cases of fraud, the credit card network can basically steal the money back from the merchants, per contract)"
"That's more of a ""soft"" confirmation, charge backs can happen weeks or months after the payment. "
As long as the account is able to fund it? I  suppose I don't fully understand your question.  I think there are any number of examples of cc transactions that initially authorize but ultimately fail due to lack of funds. 
"Until the next wave of people actually using it, then fees and wait times increase dramatically.

Would you use an ATM if its fees and wait times were randomly set every day? I don't think so. No one wants to use BTC for anything but holding because of these problems."
RBF has its uses for speeding up a transaction if you underestimated the fee. If intending to use 0-conf, simply don't opt in to RBF. Most (all?) wallets default to RBF OFF so it's not much of a problem in practice. Some wallets don't even enable the option.
Why would you assume he's from Germany just because he speaks German?
I am german too. I don't joke.
yea i was kidding. should add a /s i guess. can't believe ppl actually think like this it's unbelievable. 
"Just a disclaimer. I’m not really talking crap here. 

Yeah I sent .1 and had a 11.9 sat/B fee and it took 17 hours. No rush though I knew it’d take long "
Why do people always react so negative when people bring up the transaction fees? It’s a huuuge problem at the moment.
Could say the same thing for people paying high fees on bitcoin too... but no it's cause bitcoin is a failure. lol
That's what I mean it shouldn't need to estimate any fee when every transaction can fit into a block?
I can approve, he doesn’t say shit about 24 hours but that it took a long time
"Just to make this clear... he said it took a long time because it took him long to find a store that accepts Bitcoin in Berlin, not because he waited for this specific transaction to confirm. This was obviously a 0-confirmation transaction.

The guy was hyped and happy af that he got coffee and cake for BTC. This clip was from an objective viewpoint portraying an absolutely positive Bitcoin experience. Which is why this thread is pretty much just FUD. Why is this place so anti-Bitcoin? Noone here is happy about a positive Bitcoin article on TV, and instead rather upvotes something that tries to drag it through the mud and forcefully make it look negative? Explain that to me... this subreddit is called BTC after all."
They have both Dash and Ethereum (and some other option) in closed beta so it's getting there.
What joke? The joke that OP and the state of this subreddit in general is so anti-Bitcoin that they take a clip from recent TV with a guy being hyped af about buying coffee and cake with Bitcoin and instead slap fake subtitles on it in order to drag it through the mud and try to make it look negative, when the clip was portraying a completely positive Bitcoin experience from an objective viewpoint? This isn't a joke, it's just FUD plain and simple.

German humour is no laughing matter 
"~~That's not how RBF works. You can't change the inputs or outputs.~~

~~I agree that RBF is really dumb though. It doesn't make sense in a proper scaling context.~~

Thx everyone for helping me understand. RBF enabled 0-conf transactions are actually IOU sticky notes"
True.  But at least the fee to do that would be more than a coffee.  So for very low $ transactions this fear is not as great.  If the fee is low enough though, the transaction will never confirm.
funny enough at a bitcoin meeting someone did buy $2 worth of stickers from me and they paid a $3 fee.  
"It's a combination of factors:

- Congested block chain due to arbitrary 1 MB block size imposed by BlockStream. This means people keep paying more and more to get their transactions confirmed.
- High fees are practically the price of the coffee itself.
- Bitcoin added Replace By Fee (RBF), meaning a merchant needs to wait for 1 confirmation to give the coffee or the purchaser could rip the coffee shop off by double spending with a higher fee back to themselves.

Bitcoin Cash fixes that by removing RBF _and_ having low fees _and_ not being congested because it has spare room in the blocks. A merchant can accept transactions reliably in 10 seconds or less by checking various nodes around the network for double spends."
If you look at the BTC fees right now though, nobody is paying $7 fees...
"If the fee is too low, the transaction doesn't go through and won't even show up in the recipient wallet. The money eventually gets refunded to sender.

Edit: or not"
Or simply use Ethereum.
Stop shilling that instamine coin here.
BCH's groundbreaking, proven and tested 0-conf technology is just as fast.
"Yeah, and this is all thanks to BCH's big innovation: not even filling 100KB per block! 

This feature is so amazing, it would even work if max block size were lowered to 500KB, while Bitcoin struggles with double that amount! "
"I don't believe this.  Have you ever maxed out your visa or spent over an accounts limit in debit?  Your next transaction is _immediately_ declined.  
  
Don't spread FUD people."
If the signature matches and you got an approval, the merchant will get the money no matter what: yes or no?
"> is really just checking your card account to see that you have sufficient funds in order to authorize the purchase.

seems like a good idea for small transactions...so 0-conf essentially. Why did Replace By Fee become a thing then? Seems by putting that into place, not only does it make transacting harder, but coupled with small blocks is a recipe for disaster.

Oldie but a goodie
 Is this different than btc?  
No, I use words for their literal meaning, not your delusion.
"no it just means ""account status confirmation"" you could have multiple outstanding transactions that will take you past your spending limit when they confirm.

All they check is was it a valid card that isn't over limit or cancelled when you swipe.

Maybe you don't know this but you can still take credit card transactions when you have no internet connection. You can even take the information down physically and input it online later. Manual credit card transactions are still a thing.

How do you expect to confirm an offline transaction in real time?

How do you expect an online transaction to know about the offline transaction at the time of swipe?

If the same card is used for an online transaction and an offline transaction before either confirms? Either one could be the one that is later declined depending on the order that they are processed."
"Words matter, of course. What is your definition of confirm? To me, ""confirm"" means ""to make definite"" or to formally verify. If the money isn't really moved, then you might not get it so it's not definite or verified, it's an IOU, and one with a bunch of caveats (e.g. IOU as long as this turns out to not be fraud). Bitcoin, and it's peers, are the _only_ digital methods of payment and moving money that _aren't_ IOU's. ""Confirmed"" credit card transactions get ""un confirmed"" all the time. At best, swiping a credit card ""approves"" a transaction, not confirms it. I would also be comfortable calling it a ""partial confirmation"", but it's far from definite.

If you talk to a merchant, especially at a place like a corner store in a city, chargebacks and delays in getting money are huge issues.

EDIT: I do agree that moved is different from confirmed, just not in this case. For example, I might consider money sitting in an escrow account with a formally signed document to be ""confirmed"" but not ""moved"""
"It can only happen because the money isn't really in the merchants account, it's just ""probably"" there.

You can only say the payment has definitely been received by the merchant when it can no longer be taken back. "
~~What do you combine with a 1.0 BTC output to get a 0.01 BTC output? You can't add a negative output, that doesn't exist in Bitcoin~~

No, it's an interface issue. The previous commenter's solution works just fine and doesn't need to change the protocol. 
"So if a customer walks into a store that doesn't accept checks but the customer writes a check anyway, it's somehow a problem with checks if the store than refuses to immediately hand over the product? 

>since the problem it is trying to solve should not exist in the first place.

While I agree that it doesn't have to happen now, how will BCH solve the problem when the block reward becomes too small? Will it increase the Bitcoin limit to keep paying miners with inflation? 

"
payment processors only give you so much time to send to an address before your transaction times out
I have learned quite well... It has a rich list and private transactions are not by default. This is an absolute joke if talking only about privacy, but DASH fanboys still try to say they have the best privacy coin.. You need lots of DASH to be locked in order to run a masternode...More than half of all DASH is currently out of circulation and this helps the price go up...Also the pre-mined aspect is hard to ignore..
"This is the LITERAL definition of ""transaction confirmation"".  And when programming against any payment provider, you immediately get a ""confirmation number"".  "
So much salt. You need to learn how dash works 
"> Manual credit card transactions are still a thing.

I'm aware of this (although it is exceedingly rare).  However, when you make a normal purchase, you receive an immediate transaction confirmation."
"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki

One or more transactions currently in the mempool (original transactions) will be replaced by a new transaction (replacement transaction) that spends one or more of the same inputs if,

1. The original transactions signal replaceability explicitly or through inheritance as described in the above Summary section.

2. The replacement transaction does not contain any new unconfirmed inputs that did not previously appear in the mempool. (Unconfirmed inputs are inputs spending outputs from currently unconfirmed transactions.)

3. The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.

4. The replacement transaction must also pay for its own bandwidth at or above the rate set by the node's minimum relay fee setting. For example, if the minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte and the replacement transaction is 500 bytes total, then the replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the originals.

5. The number of original transactions to be replaced and their descendant transactions which will be evicted from the mempool must not exceed a total of 100 transactions."
You can replace any transaction so long as you pay for it. Doesn't have to be the exact same outputs. Doesn't have to be the same output amounts, and in fact increasing the fee necessarily decreases the amount of one or more  of the outputs. See my reply to the comment above 
Bigger blocks also mean more tx that pay fees. There can be the same total amount of fees, but if the block is bigger the individual tx have to pay less.
"Your check analogy is a bit flawed,
The store does accept checks, so customer writes one, and hands it over. the cashier sees (or rather the PoS device) that it is a RBF check, so it is not accepted. The customer don't know or understands the difference between checks, since it was just told that checks works, and the bank said that these checks works anywhere where checks are accepted."
My comment was supposed to be sarcastic.
I dislike the premine but I quite like DASH. It doesn't have the most privacy but I think it has adequate privacy vs the cost of using something like Monero, and coins like Decred are barely a thing yet
"I put ""un confirmed"" in quotes because it's rediculous. It's not a real confirmation if it can be undone"
"Holy crap you're right.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3urm8o/optin_rbf_is_misunderstood_ask_questions_about_it/cxhcrgc/

I was thinking of RBF-FSS: ""To address those concerns, a variation on RBF was created that required that the replacement transaction pay all of same outputs as the original transaction in equal or greater amount. This was called RBF First Seen Safe (RBF-FSS), and the original RBF became known as full-RBF."""
"I know, but that's assuming the blocks get full. 

If they don't, people will pay close to 0 fees which might not be enough to support a big enough hashrate to keep the network secure.

If they full then what you're saying applies, but the problem of possibly not being confirmed in the next block also exists, which is what we were talking about.

You either have the possibility of not being confirmed in the next block or you have the problem of how to pay the miners when the block reward reduces, you can't ignore both at the same time.

And once again, I'm not saying that the fees must be higher now, I agree that the block reward is still plenty."
Even after you've moved actual cash, it can also be undone.  Thats part of the contractual obligations of the merchant.  Claw back has nothing to do with confirmation.  Again, words.  
The elite greatest world champion God-king-emporer developers in Core are against FSS, because it's more work to implement, and now the autistic mastermind behind RBF feels he's even too important to call himself a Core dev anymore.
"Right, that's why I said up to 90 days, or whatever the contract states. The point I'm trying to make here is that in the OP the implication was that you'd have to wait 24 hours to get an on chain confirmation. Then the point was made that you'd need to camp out for months to get a similar amount of certainty with a credit card transaction. You seem to be saying that a credit card transaction is instantly ""confirmed"" whereas a Bitcoin transaction is ""confirmed"" after it makes it into a block. My point is that those two usages of the word ""confirm"" are so radically different that it isn't fair to compare them.

I think that a credit card approval (not sure if it really even is called a confirmation in the industry) is roughly equivalent to a zero conf BTC transaction if you wait a few minutes and check a few other nodes in the network, whereas a single confirmation on the BTC network is roughly equivalent to ""having the money"" from a cc transaction. Therefore it's not fair to compare the ""confirmation"" time on BTC to the ""approval"" time on a credit card"
"> ""Confirmed"" credit card transactions get ""un confirmed""

So you are using the right words for ""transaction confirmation"" and you agree that this happens immediately.  This is all I am saying.  
  
You are saying other things about why you don't like the credit card system compared to bitcoin.  
   
All that I am saying is that transactions are immediately confirmed."
">and there's too little time (under 2 seconds to do anything)...

Yes, our standard for fees is that we pray whenever we want to buy something that we can do so without having to pay 10USD in fees. But no problem here, *right now* BTC is perfectly fine, even for coffee.
Whatever suits you, but my point stands, hashpower and dollars are enforcing the limit, not blockstream. 
Yes, but they take the humour very seriously. If the joke is not perfectly conjugated it's a catastrophe.
"AWK - WARDDDD

"So you're saying nobody can tell when they do? ;)"
"~~That does not say anything about removing outputs, just bundling multiple into a single transaction.~~

EDIT: Wow I was wrong. You can change the outputs with the implemented version of RBF. 

I.. kind of want to buy some bitcoin so i can try this.. it seems unreal. Merchants have to carefully inspect the TX if they want to do 0-conf. Who wants this??"
"If the customers app had 2 big buttons, one called ""FASTPAY"" and one is called ""SECUREPAY"", this would be no problem. FASTPAY could be even coded into the QR code the customer has to scan anyway. People need not to know what RBF is and how it works. All they need to know is to press FASTPAY for their coffee and SECUREPAY if they buy a house. "
"""You can either wait for it to be confirmed or you can send a non-rbf transaction now and we'll credit you the first transaction on your next visit"".

But ideally the QR code itself should state the intent to not use RBF, I'm not sure if that's already possible or not but it would solve the issue. "
Just the same as any other payment method that has restrictions at point of sale by vendors. Visa is easy for a buyer to use, but many vendors require 5 dollars (or more) of purchases to use credit cards because of transactions fees charged to merchants by Visa. This phenomenon is not unique to bitcoin: it certainly can affect BCH if it gains enough popularity.

If they could figure that out easily."
"
>*Imposed by Satoshi, not lifted by the majority of miners and capital

It is completely impossible to speak about the majority of anything other than hashpower and dollars. Everything else is easily faked."
Electrum is ALWAYS high, whether the network is congested or not. I have it set on low fees, it still quoted me over $2 to be sent in <25 blocks a few days ago. i edited it to $0.11, and it got the 1st confirmation in <20 minutes. 
">said electrum

That's your problem right there. Don't trust pre-calculated 'guesswork' fees and you won't have to overpay for your transactions. It is a problem currently, but the transaction fees aren't a problem, it's the shitty software that we all have to use that refuses to adapt and adjust. BTC transaction fees *right now*  are perfectly acceptable (although they can always be lower by my standards obviously)."
Ah I see. It happened to me a long time ago and it seemed like it got sent because the wallet (electrum) will deduct it from the balance.
Or simply use any coin but bitcoin.
BCH does not have the problems of BTC.  Who told you that BCH has problems with 0-conf transactions ?  A new transaction reaches over 98% of hashpower within 2 seconds. It would be incredibly expensive to try to scam a merchant for $5 and and there's too little time (under 2 seconds to do anything)... The pre-mined DASH may have high price due to the artificially extreme limited supply , but it does not offer anything more than BCH, and about privacy - it's a joke.
"0-conf means you can count on your transaction to be confirmed after it has been propogated to enough nodes. This only takes a few seconds. You don't need to wait for the actual confirmations. Because the blocks are never full you can count on the transaction to be confirmed even if the fee is really small.


If you're buying a house or a car the seller should definetily wait for a few confirmations but since we're talking about transactions well below $100 you can do without and still be 99.99% sure that the transaction will be confirmed.


This should be common knowledge by now.."
"""protocols"" for all intents and purposes, means ""transaction confirmation"".  "
"What you mean is the money isn't really moved.  This is a very different statement.  
  
In actual fact, the transaction is confirmed right away.  
  
Words matter.  "
Charge backs can happen well after the real cash has left your account and gone to the merchants account.  That has nothing to do with this.
"> RBF has its uses

So I guess the question we ask ourselves is which do we value more, 0-conf driving adoption, or the security of speeding up a slow transaction. A problem that seems to have come to the forefront due to the congested blocks."
He meant it literally. 
Haha
Say Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob. The fee was too low and it doesn't go through, so Alice does RBF. Even if she is required to keep Bob as on output, it says nothing about the amount sent to Bob, since Alice still technically owns the whole bitcoin. So Alice decides to change Bob's 1 BTC to 0.0000001 BTC, and send the rest back to her own address (or another address which she controls). Now Bob is out of his money, and Alice just robbed him on the blockchain.
It should definitely be a feature of any POS service
Changing the interface doesn't change the protocol. What we're talking about is at the protocol level
"Seriously, would you, as a customer actually accept that? not a chance, It just puts Bitcoin in bad light.

This is an issue that should not exist in the first place RBF should not exist, since the problem it is trying to solve should not exist in the first place."
"But the major difference is that in one case you won't be able to transact at all, and in the other you do transact, but after that you get told that your payment isn't valid.

No matter what you think about the second case, the fact is that it does happen. And it hard (not to mention unnecessary) to end up and handle that situation. Especially since most likely the clerk don't know anything about Bitcoin in the first place."
Are you saying they can't? That information is contained in the transaction itself, many/most wallets can tell you if a transaction is or isn't RBF.

BCH is clearly much better as a transactional currency than BTC, and obviously lots of people here ridicule BTC for its slow speed and high fees (e.g., this post), but BCH still has very apparent limitations that, as far as I can see, make it impractical for making most purchases in shops. Are people banking on BCH incorporating other technologies in the future, or what's the long term thoughts of anyone invested in it? Right now solutions like Dash's InstantX, or lightning network, seem to be far more applicable to real world use cases to me, instead of just speculative investment."

>Right now solutions like Dash's InstantX, or lightning network, seem to be far more applicable to real world use cases to me, instead of just speculative investment.

There was never a need to choke the on-chain transactions the way it played out, just to make SegWit/Lightning Network an option. If these technologies are so revolutionary, they are free to come play with the rest of us in an uncensored un-artificially capped environment, I'm sure. But for the near future, simply increasing the blocksize has helped BCH immensely with usability and solved a lot of issues for the frustrated many, who just want to use Bitcoin as a currency, like intended in the whitepaper. Maybe when 32mb blocks become full and fees are high on BCH, SegWit will prove itself to be scientifically the most effective method of increasing transaction throughput compared to any other tech that gets developed, or simply increasing the blocksize further.... However, I don't think it will be and there's already other options being developed like this

and experiments with much larger 1GB block sizes. To me that is two good paths to scaling being covered, while in the meantime the on-chain capacity of BCH is working well for those who want to use it. Looking to the future is good, but what good is a future built on a broken system.... just my opinion of course."
Lightning doesn't exist now and won't be ready for another 18 months, according to developers. In Bitcoin development terms thats a long time ...
yeah, what are the benefits of bch over ltc?
"The subtitles are quite accurate (with a few very loose translations) except for the last two sentences.    I guess that is why everyone is complaining.

The subtitles are wrong. He does not say anything about bitcoin being the future or the blockchain like you can read in the last 10s.
"""short"" 24 hours later?lol"
Bitpay or Ucoin Cash? They both have card with chip to pay. 
funny.
And how much extra did it cost with the fees? 25%?
Did nobody heard of Bitkassa? That need to wait at a shop to get your payment confirmed is nonsens. I never need to wait when I pay with Bitcoin.
LOL

In german he dont say that it take 24 hours. He said a short time.
"He did not actually say that though. He came out and was hyped as fuck because he could get actual cake and coffee for Bitcoin.

The fact that this blatant FUD is the top-vosted thread in this subreddit speaks volumes. This is an anti-Bitcoin cesspool of a subreddit."

"Why did my bitcoin Cash wallet charge me $0.43 

Still too expensive for coffee purchase"
ITT: People who don't understand crypto currency.
Guys this is a little misleading... it only took my last BTC transaction 18 hours...
The coffee shop should run it's own miner.  That way it has a chance of making money on the transaction.
He didn't said it took 24 hours, he just said it took a long time. Translation is wrong.
Lol 
Here is an actual example from a layman's perspective a couple weeks ago. Interesting perspective https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=232403
"This was an advert for TenX that aired yesterday, although annoyingly they never actually mentioned the company behind the tech. You will note that at 0.21 he is showing the wallet app on his phone. Here is a [larger version](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIib9GsWsAQybWN.jpg) (not from the video and not my image) With TenX you have a debit card that hold multiple crypto's including Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin and other ERC20 (DGX, REP, TRUST, NEO, etc.) tokens.
You pay for things using the debit card as you would a standard debit card and the payment is instant. (no waiting for the next block etc to confirm payment) The app shows you how much you currently have in EUR/GBP to spend and when you pay using the card the wallet app will update instantly.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdyC_QEqN1U) showing it in action. There are plenty of user videos out there as well. Worth looking into. The team are always keeping the users and investors up to date with how things are going with the tech.

Currently the cards are only working in Europe, but it will soon be worldwide."
The subtext is wrong. When he leaves the store he says it took a while until he got his coffee, he is probably referring to the hassle of using a Bitcoin Wallet, which he says he has never used before. Nowhere does it say anything about confirmation time.
"The propaganda is strong ... I'm not on one side or the other but I have not had any problems sending bitcoins, the confirmation wasn't that long, 15 minutes the longest I think, and never paid more than a few bucks to send 200-300 $ worth of bitcoin. 

Why can't you focus on what's good about bch and not put out these trashy videos bashing bitcoin. It's like attack style politics, I don't think it leaves a good impression with lots of people. "
Beat that dead horse. Aren't we bored of this yet? I got bored of it last week.
Sorry, centralized coins don't count. 
Get a shift card ya dolts 
"5 quit for snacks and 5 for fees. nice 
chose xrp or xlm next time "
Feels like I'm buying stuff in the future. Truly future commerce.
iota baby, no transaction cost at all
Dont need confirmations for instant transactions, no one gonna attack that kind of transaction
I go with Bitcoin is the protocol/brand, bitcoins are the token. (Note the difference in capitalization)
"I can't believe i'm typing this but YES I MADE UP THE FUCKING SUBTITLES. Come on, Satoshi Christ....

"So you say they do things instant on kinda like an uhmmm.. how should i call it... second layer to make it instant. But that would be pretty centralized because it's done by TenX. I wonder what we could do to make this ""second layer"" more decentralized."
The joke flew right over your head didn't it? Even though there was a satire tag right there
DId you not notice that this is a joke video?
As explained above, that will take about a month to confirm, you just assume VISA or MasterCard or AMEX are good for it. If you've ever tried to do the books for a retail store you'd soon find this out.
There was no need before Replace-by-fee functionality, which allows the buyer to simply send another transaction with much higher fee later, and thus get his money to another of his addresses. The payment with higher fee will be confirmed first... This stopped many merchants from accepting BTC... Bitcoin cash does not have this stupidity in the code.
You're right about that. The reason Bitcoin Core is now useless for this kind of transaction is not the waiting time for block inclusion or 6 blocks but the ridiculous fees. No-one is going to spend $5 on a coffee plus $7 fee.  This is where Bitcoin Cash has the advantage - low fees.

Have you heard of 0-conf?
"I'm a big TenX fan, don't get me wrong, and hence why I saw this originally, but

>with TenX you have a debit card that hold multiple crypto's including Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin and other ERC20 (DGX, REP, TRUST, NEO, etc.) tokens. 

Is not true yet. It's BTC only. The idea is great but Julian's faith in BTC and SegWit doesn't do a lot for me, and I am patiently waiting for other cryptos to come out on everyone's wallets, not just beta testers."
That's where DASH instasend in 4seconds would come in handy
The difference is if you send with a low fee, BTC will not confirm now.  Has happened to me recently.  Before once you saw the transaction on the network in almost all cases you were good. Now you really don't know if the fee is low.
I’ve had to wait for a confirmation before. The person i was paying didn’t know anything about Bitcoin and that’s what they were told. Waited 30 minutes :(
Bitcoin Cash is very different because confirmations happen in the next block. With Bitcoin, the confirmation may never happen.
Conversely,  if you were required to wait for a visa confirmation at every place of business, you'd need to camp out for up to a month.  
Regardless until its regulated and trusted compared to regular cards that doesn't mean anything 
"Your transactions on the visa network are not confirmed right away, they take time, but because of trusted parties and protocols, the transaction is expected to be approved.  
If this was paid in Visa, and he wanted to wait for transaction confirmation, they would have to wait untill the end of the day, when Visa processes their batch of transactions for that day.  (Visa will batch their transactions, which to my understanding is what Segwit or lightning is for.)"
"The instant transaction you make with a credit or debit card is really just checking your card account to see that you have sufficient funds in order to authorize the purchase.   You sign or punch your pin and go on your way,  though no real funds have been exchanged yet.   

The transaction between the merchant and your bank then continues.  A brick and mortar merchant might batch all cc transactions together to process at the close of business that day.  They're sent to a network that then requests funds from your card issuer.  After that,  it will deduct from your account and appear on your statement. 

At times this may take up to 30 days."
This is not really realistic. If this customer wanted a good deal and pay a fair amount for his coffee, he would have to wait around a week for confirmation. Coffee shops should really work on providing camping space if they want to accept BTC payments in the future.
I thought the joke was going to be that the coffee costs 3 cents or something because the fees will then make it to the price of the coffee.
"In practice a customer can fuck over the merchant with BTC, that isn't possible with Cash, so yes it is different in this regard.

BTC cannot be trusted with RBF. Cash is virtually guaranteed to be one way and that it will be included within a block or two. "
Can you confirm transactions with a node or something?
[deleted]
"Before Bitcoin, buying coffee was almost impossible. That is why we invented a global, immutable, permissionless, finite, unhackable, decentralized currency and ledger. 

"
"This is an unfair characterization of Bitcoin.

If he paid a $15 transaction fee on his coffee, it would have confirmed very quickly within 30 minutes."
"Yeah, several of them ""estimate"" prices, like Exodus. I wound up paying about that, which is bullshit. I like the wallet but I think I'll move on to somewhere where I can control that better."
"No lol, all these years people were using bitcoin for payments and now suddenly in the last few months it's 'not meant for payments'?!

Of course not, this is just what core wants you to think, that it's supposed to be like gold. While people have been using bitcoin for years already, with countless stores worldwide even taking bitcoin payments up front."
"Don't overpay:  
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/transaction/244912612
1s/b works on BCH.  
On BTC you have to be lucky that the mempool is empty or low to send with lower fees where even the low fee is much higher than on BCH.  "
"No he doesn't. He says ""es hat zwar lange gedauert"" which translates to ""although it took a long time"". Stop lying."
which wallet so i can avoid?
"Really? I have no reason to back this up but I have to say I kind of like it.

Also my closest IRL friend who is also into crypto just says ""Bitcoin"", not ""Bitcoins,"" and he is German. So I think it's not so universal."
lol nice try /u/nullc
Easy now. We have yet to see their mobile payment strategy. A debit card won’t cut it moving forward.
Because you must have a crappy wallet. 
Really? Mine took around 17 minutes to confirm. 0.49 BTC with 0.0002 BTC fee.
I have PAY tokens and a TenX card, that's where I saw the (original) video. But TenX's whole operation depends on Bitcoin being slow and not widely accepted. I couldn't SPEND BTC without my TenX card, and now I won't spend any more because I'm not spending my money on fees and waiting around to send to my card. As soon as they add ETH for everyone, that will be my coin of choice. Adding Bitcoin Cash would be great, but I doubt they will do it any time soon. Julian has said 1MB blocks are fine.... and of course they are fine for TenX remaining relevant. I think the company shows great promise but it needs to add more coins ASAP.
"I may get downvote like crazy for saying this.... But.... Didn't countless coins prior to this solve all the problems I see people complaining about BTC for having. Faster Transactions, Lower Fees, More Secure, More Anonymous... And more like Asic Resistant ect. 

Ripping on Bitcoin because Bitcoin Cash just started making improvements few weeks back and solving problems that have already been solved. A lot of these other coins already solve this, better, and years ago. ?!? 

I don't mean to be rude, or trigger anyone. It's an honest concern, unless I missed some point about BCH. 

Disclaimer: I own the exact same amount as BCH as I do BTC, and I hodl some alts. Every coins success is a plus for me.

Good lookin' out
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin too.  Bitcoin is the sum total of all its forks.
Yeah, all that backend stuff is nice and all, but we're concerned specifically with online communities in this conversation.  And the one you linked to appears to be pretty much just an ordinary old-school linear message board (much like Bitcointalk.org, for instance), which is an outdated format belonging to the last decade.
"Spot on.

/u/tippr $5"
Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin Core, but it's still Bitcoin.
What, you think the admins actually care about the platform outside of whatever can get them money?
"Hey Luke, remember a while ago you told me that blocksizes would eventually need to be increased *when needed*, and I asked you about 4 times for your measurements/limits, or a cut-off point of 'when' that would be in your opinion, but you didn't answer?

Fancy giving it an answer?"
"u/spez /u/AchievementUnlockd /u/Chtorr 

Don't you realize that hundreds of thousands of people are casually reading rbitcoin for information on Bitcoin, and _basing their investment decisions off what they see there?_ Bitcoin has gone from $1000 to $8000 in a year, and with that price increase, hundreds of thousands of people are going there to learn about it. People who browse rbitcoin casually have no idea what's going on, or that the narrative is completely manipulated towards those who support a very specific path. I'm not asking reddit to take sides. What I'm asking is that they simply make it a place where discussion about the topic (Bitcoin) is allowed, from all sides. The mods there are also, in all likelihood, hacking/manipulating users' accounts, which is a very grave sitewide violation. Bitcoin is much bigger than reddit or some niche topic. It's money that belongs to the world, and a handful of manipulative forum mods are doing a wonderful job of abusing their positions to turn the world's most popular discussion channels into propaganda outlets. That's basically what rbitcoin is now. It's a propaganda machine for the [Blocktream corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream). The worst part is, people going there _have no idea that it's happening_. And reddit does nothing."
The whole point of a fork is to take an alternate path to differentiate if you will.  BCH does do this. BCH is not BTC.   That's why BCH is BCH and not BTC. 
"And here I was thinking people were concerned with censorship ;) I hear you. It will improve with time, don't you worry. If you're a developer, I suggest you check out Utopian.io."
I'm pro r/btc and I'm for net neutrality as many of us are.
Yup, until its not.
Is that just a traditional linear message board?  Fuck that.
Nice statement. I would agree!

i agree
Because we believe in Etherium. 
"> Moderate inflation doesn't discourage people from accepting a currency.

Sure, because practically speaking, the fact that your extremely easy to pour bucket has a small, slow leak isn't enough to make you abandon it for day-to-day transactional purposes when the only other options are buckets that are much harder to pour.  At least over the short term, the network effect is almost everything (and a small network effect translates to a very difficult to pour bucket). Also consider that the government has a very heavy thumb on the scale when it comes to the market for money. Taxes are payable exclusively in a nation's fiat. Legal tender laws also place fiat in a privileged position. And would-be money competitors are further disadvantaged by things like the requirement to pay tax on capital gains when trading (e.g.) precious metals that may have appreciated in value (even if those ""gains"" are only an artifact of fiat's depreciation). 

>When you examine examples of Greshams law in real life, you see the opposite of what you suggest would happen.

I don't think Gresham's law applies.  From the wikipedia entry: ""In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that 'bad money drives out good'. For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, **which are accepted by law as having similar face value,** the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.""

>Not taking up resources isn't an act that creates value. Dead people also don't take up resources, they're not producing any value. 

The key is not taking up resources *when you have an immediately exercisable claim that would allow you to do so.* To make it a bit more concrete, here's an example I've used before:

Imagine a high school kid that mows 50 lawns over the summer to earn enough to buy a used car.  The ""real"" economic exchange there is 50 mowed lawns for 1 used car.  Money is just the medium of exchange that makes it possible for that trade to occur across multiple parties and across time.  (Barter would be a little trickier given the difficulty of finding a guy who a) has the car you want to buy; b) wants to sell it; and c) has 50 lawns that need mowing.) Now imagine that the kid decides not to immediately buy the used car but to instead wait a year.  Well, he has now given value for which he has yet to receive any kind of real satisfaction.  (The green pieces of paper in his wallet are obviously not what he really wants.) And that also means that someone else gets to enjoy the use of that car for another year.  The kid has thus effectively *loaned* the value of his services as represented by that car to society.  That's why it makes sense to me that money's purchasing power should increase over time.  Deflation is simply the ""interest"" on a kind of low-risk loan.

Also consider that instead of simply deferring the car's purchase for a year, he could have bought the car immediately and then loaned it out to someone for rental income.

>The best you can be talking about is a zero-sum transfer of wealth to other people, since taking money out of supply helps deflate the supply and increase the unit value.

Saving money does represent a transfer of purchasing power to other people (those who decide to spend now), but it's not zero sum because those two groups obviously have different preferences.  

>Why invest in a new form of production that makes 5% return if simply sitting on your money makes 6%?

Well you shouldn't. If we're assuming a fixed-supply money, what does that 6% price deflation number tell you?  It tells you that there must be lots of investment opportunities with a return of *at least* 6%.  Basically, that's the number to beat.  If you're looking at an investment opportunity with a measly 5% return, deflation is telling you not to waste your time because there are higher and better uses of that capital.  
 "
">The kid has thus effectively loaned the value of his services as represented by that car to society. That's why it makes sense to me that money's purchasing power should increase over time. Deflation is simply the ""interest"" on a kind of low-risk loan.

This is a well constructed, logically valid example but its built on what I think I can demonstrate is a false premise and so leads to a false conclusion.

It assumes that if you buy a car, that means one less car for everyone else in the world, so by not redeeming your cash for a car you are somehow *loaning* the value of that car (or anything else you could buy) to the world until you decide to claim it. Except cars aren't fixed resources, they're produced. 

Buying a car doesn't reduce the availability of cars, it increases it, because for every one car you buy, the manufacturer makes enough money to build 2 or 3 new cars. They can also use that money to improve their factories, which makes cars even cheaper (meaning people have even more money to buy other goods and services that generate yet more wealth).

Not spending money is actually decreasing the availability of cars in terms of opportunity cost. If you don't buy the car, there's only 1 car available and it does no good to anyone whilst waiting to be sold. Once bought, the car can provide value to you, as well as allowing the manufacturer to make more cars, making cars available to several more people.

Trade is a virtuous cycle, which is why high velocity of money is desirable in a currency and hoarding is not.

There are more fundamental reasons why not spending money isn't equivalent to loaning its value to the world, even in a zero sum world, (i.e. the car is no more available if you refuse to claim it than if you just never did the work in the first place, or worked for free, so there is no opportunity cost), but since we don't live in a zero-sum world its not necessary to go into that level of detail.

Moneys only value is to facilitate trade. There is no way for it to generate value doing nothing, because there's no difference between burying money in a vault for a trillion years and just burning it. The only way doing nothing can seem to generate value is zero-sum wealth transfer by increased demand for money which comes about from reduced supply by people taking money out of circulation. This is rent seeking behavior, which rewards people for economic inactivity.

This is beautiful!  I just posted a similar sentiment....my first post since signing back onto reddit after two years, having originally been an r/bitcoin semi-reg.  Was also disenfranchised and sold all Bitcoin for Ether.  I have now diversified back into Bitcoin Cash as well....for the same reasons why I originally got into Bitcoin waaay back....for the morality of it!  Power back to the people!  So good to read your post :)
Thank you! 
Lot's of things have religious history - in particular most old things.  Because in olden times almost everyone was religious.
A lot of the Catholic institutions were taken over by King Henry VIII in the 16th century. Lots of interesting history there.
"> You obviously never used amdoullah chipsets also known as AMD

Well, sometimes it doesn't not mean normal negation.
"> and the teachers may be all nuns, or all monks

Wow, that really exists?  The mind boggles.  I really thought that was only in the movies."
"Sorry attempt of religious joke.

Fail"
Everyone's still religious...many have just chosen to be religious about things like decentralization, or gender, or any other hot button topic of today.
"No, the Catholic universities look very much like secular ones.

Some Catholic high schools, on the other hand, are run by monastic orders and the teachers may be all nuns, or all monks.  Some used to be exclusively for girls or exclusively for boys, but they may have changed due to state pressure, I don't know. There are also high schools founded by Jesuits, that used to have mostly or exclusively Jesuit priests as teachers."
Cloisters and monasteries need to be mostly self-sufficient financially.  Running a tuition-charging school is just one of the ways.  Some may run others businesses that are compatible with their nature, such as [bakeries](http://padariadomosteiro.com.br/Home.php), breweries, hostels, woodworking, etc.  Before the printing press, copying books was also an important source of money.
"It still exists, but is less common in the US. I went to college where there was a monastery, and some of the professors were monks. Our sister school, a few miles away, had a convent attached, and one of my most memorable teachers was a nun. 
The university system as we know it has the Catholic Church to thank for existing."
"I was about to point out that our college's modern name is generally taken to be because it's on Jesus Lane (the college taking the name from the street, not vice versa).  But then I remembered the early name of the college: ""The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist, and the Glorious Virgin St. Radegund.""

Yeah, you got me there.

EDIT: We were founded on the site of a nunnery-of-ill-repute - if that helps make us less religious, though :-)"
"Of course there is:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_University_of_America"
"I'm not sure I'd call that religious.  That fact that the word ""religious"" is sometimes used metaphorically to describe strongly held beliefs in other areas doesn't actually make those beliefs religious.  That's not how metaphors work LOL."
Oh interesting.  Of course, I'm familliar with the beers brewed by Belgian monks - didn't know monks made bread too.
"**Catholic University of America**

The Catholic University of America (CUA) is a private university located in Washington, D.C. in the United States. It is a pontifical university of the Catholic Church in the United States and the only institution of higher education founded by the U.S. Catholic bishops. Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by Pope Leo XIII on Easter Sunday, the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904. The university's campus lies within the Brookland neighborhood, known as ""Little Rome"", which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including Trinity Washington University and the Dominican House of Studies.

I guess it depends on what you think ""religious"" means.  If  you define religious belief to be anything that can't be justified epistemologically, then sure, I'm religious.  I just don't think that's a normal use of the word, though.  There are more possibilities than that."
(Posting at the top of this subthread for visibility - and because this applies equally to all subthreads):  This has ended up being a genuinely interesting conversation about educational establishments with a religious background.  It's the first time in a long while on a bitcoin subreddit I've had a genuinely interesting conversation about anything.  I miss the days when we used to have genuinely interesting conversations like this that were actually about bitcoin LOL.  Sadly, interesting Bitcoin conversations have been illegal for several years.
Oi mano!
I didn't understand nothing of what you just said
"I read it as funny sarcasm.

It is a good sign that in this sub the people are relaxing again to such a degree that jokes like yours are upvoted.

Thanks for the laugh. And if you didn't intend it that way: extra thanks for the unintended laugh. :) "
"Given the number of times I heard “OMG please let it compile” then yes it may help even though definitely not mandatory ;-)"
No, I meant you say it is a he because of the type of humour he has. I say I know it is a he because he has a sense of humour at all
Qualé!
It's not a he/she. It's a he. I can tell ~~by the sense of humor~~ because he has a a sense of humour.
That guy wasn't a customer.
That was a great example of a moron customer though, and a great comeback by her. Got to say this post makes me a bit of a fan of hers.
Math don't lie = thousands of people obsessed with crypto
Ah, gotcha. I can see that now. And yes, I actually mean what you said. And thanks for writing this. I' pretty good with English, but I'm trying to get even better. Thanks!

Honestly, I'd have him on payroll.
"> I just don't think that's a normal use of the word, though.

I know, and that's what makes the world such a dangerous place.

People who are openly and knowingly religious are a lot easier to deal with because they admit that some of their ideas are faith-based.

The people who run around with faith-based ideas that they assume are reason-based are terrifyingly destructive."

Depending on how the post is removed, you have no idea your post is gone, while you're logged in it looks like it is still there.

What do you mean?
Bitmain innovates and sells chips (like Nvidia, but more specialized). Buy the chip and pick what to mine. What's your problem? 
Not problem! Chinese monopoly! Chinese gov make BCH number 1!
