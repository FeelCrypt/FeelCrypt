I'm talking about [Satoshi](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366). 
"The B in BCH stands for Bitcoin just like the B in BTC stands for Bitcoin. Satoshi came up with a system where scaling would not be an issue as long as the law of moore would keep up when it comes to disk storage and as long as the price of bandwith keeps going down. 

He wrote under point 7 ""Reclaiming Disk Space"" in his white paper called ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

>Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.


>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

So that covers disk space.  Bitcoin can grow without outgrowing the growth in disk space. 

Then bandwith. Satoshi writes: 

>
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

>If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 


So Satoshi designed a system that looked at disk storage and bandwidth and those would never cause a problem in scaling, otherwise he would have designed the system differently.

Are you talking about Craig Wright?
Yeah, you are interested in the word which can be seen in the fact that you stole it. If BCH is the real Bitcoin then why isn’t it called just Bitcoin. It is a fork of Bitcoin that improves upon nothing and increases block size. No one knows what is the ideal block size should be so why not proceed with caution? You are in effect a Bitcoin test-net for larger blocks. Well done, bravo!  
That’s the problem with this “community”. Constantly acting almighty and never offering explanations or solutions. You don’t have time? Why did you take the time to post something hat added no value then? It’s not cause you don’t have the time. It’s cause you are too stupid to grasp any of the concepts and are just a Ver troll.

"Thoughtful. Still doesn’t answer what the ideal block size is at current storage/bandwidth. The bigger the blocks the more centralized and more expensive to mine in regards to bytes/watt or however you want to measure it. What about a 51% attack? What about quantum resistance? The point I’m trying to make is that we don’t know a lot of stuff at this point. Satoshi didn’t know everything either or they wouldn’t have disappeared. Bitcoin might be the best idea since the internet itself but satoshi is not a god. 

Being divided into BCH or BTC is counterproductive. And all I see the BCH community do is trash talk. In never see good conversations going on here or on twitter. Never pushing the boundaries just taking the easy path and kicking the feet back whilst bashing on the other side. At least BTC is having tough conversations and trying to find real scalable solutions. Rapid adoption would happen a lot faster than Moore’s law could keep up with imo."

Laughing at stupid, is good for a second, then you realize idiocracy is closer than you think.
"HOOOOOOOLLLY COW.

I was about to say, isn't this the exact problem that the Blockchain itself was implemented to deal with? We can't trust people to accurately record the state of their own wallet (as attached to their private key, you can obviously mess around with the wallet as much as you like if the key isn't compromised) so we distribute the state to the whole network. ""Address 123 has 3 btc"" as confirmed by every full node in the network.

In 'first layer' Bitcoin, if someone sends an invalid transaction it gets rejected by the consensus. The only way to overcome the consensus is to carry out a 51% attack (i.e. *become* the consensus). Spamming won't work if the network is robust enough.

Lightning Network adds in a penalty to those who attempt invalid transactions *in place of the PoW requirement* and likewise does not have a ledger to reference. It is vulnerable to a spam attack so it needs some method of enforcement, hence the penalty.

Which means it has no practical way (at this point) of identifying a 'true' attackers vs. someone who, as here, is just using an out-of-date version of their channel state or, perhaps, states that were corrupted by someone other than the user, intentionally, since they can't check a tamper-proof ledger to recall the state.

So basically they get Type I errors (false positives) and apply the penalty to innocent parties.

Which is REALLLLLLLLLY BAD IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ENTRUST THE SYSTEM WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF CURRENCY.

It'd be a bit like if your Bank dinged you $500 every time an *apparently* fraudulent transaction appeared on your account, whether it was actually fraudulent or not. Oh, and had an absolute policy against reversing said charge.

*****

I may have misunderstood something, but either way it starts to confirm my long-held suspicions that the LN is an increasingly complex solution that is going to create a lot of additional problems before it is perfected (if ever).

And the unwillingness to raise the block limit in the meantime is going to look more and more unreasonable. "

This is true across the whole market due to the speculative hype bubble popping. The reality is BCC never had much usage and many blocks are still under 50 kB

And if I remember correctly, upping the block size is still a possibility in the future, after everything is done to limit the size."
Hehe fair enough :)
He was told that by the other subs, they most be right.
"A mining cartel can reclaim 60-80% of all these fees with a spam attack and have a net profit with higher onchain fees. 

This is no longer the case because by doing so they simply drive users offchain to LN adoption "

"https://www.bitcoinabc.org/bitcoin-abc-medium-term-development

Even bitcoin cash (ABC client) is doing this:
> Increase default block-size limit, and move towards adaptive block size limit"
"> Other coins have no issue with floating block size. 

I think most would agree (even core guys) that bitcoin's block size should be adaptable (via algorithmus or via soft fork). As far as I get it the fixed max block size came originally from some temporary anti-spam measure; the only way to get rid off it was then a hard-fork, which many opposed against. BCH has done the hard-fork already, BTC will do it sooneror later, too.
"
Yes, when no one is using it.
"That's just pedantry.  You know quite well that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are now different things.  And that the network effect means that there is more to establishing an alternative than simply ""forking"".  Bitcoin core changing it's current limit is in no way the same as creating a fork.

As to your second point: a chain with no imposed limit is not dictatorship since it is the removal of a limitation. Having a physical limit because there is only so much bandwidth in the pipe is as much ""dicatorship"" as is gravity stopping us going to Mars."
That's still orders of magnitude more expensive

"Full nodes that don't mine? What else do they do other that relaying transactions? They don't validate shit.

Redditor bitusher has low karma in this subreddit.
"I agree that when the blocks are full a bigger part of the current resources goes to utilizing the use of block space, but if we'll increase the block size limit, we'll have more adoption, and more resources as a whole, so even if the percentage of resources that will go to developing better ways to utilize block space will reduce, there will be probably more resources then the alternative.

And I'm not sure that the quicker adoption of the LN is necessary a good thing. If BTC's blocks weren't full there was no need to rush to release a mainnet version of the LN, and it could be done when they find a good routing solution, after developing things like watchtowers and more things that we'll make it safer and more convenient for daily usage."
What's the confusion?  If Bitcoin ever reaches a point that only powerful servers with super fast internet connections can propagate blocks, then Bitcoin nodes will be powerful servers with super fast internet connections.
"It's almost like Bitcoin is a protocol that was always intended to scale in this way and we should actively question why a currency that doesn't intend to follow the protocol would continue to use the name of the protocol.

But, nah, I'm sure it's black-and-white thinking."
Again, if he got things so wrong, why not blaze your own path under a different plan?
[deleted]
Stop giving them hints...they have dug their own grave, let the die in it.
SegWIT WAS a blocksize increase, and also gave the ability for people to use timelocked contracts to make Lightning possible. BTC is NOT dead, nor dying. It's only under attack right now, but seeing as it's antifragile, I don't think it's going to matter in the long run. Bitcoin with Segwit and lightning network WILL be the way going forward to allow instant, cheap-to-free transactions with Bitcoin. EVERY TX DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. Why would you want all of your transactions there? Would suck if a corporation unmasked a couple of your addresses and knew everything about your spending habits. At least with Lightning there is no record. There's another advantage of LN, stronger anonymity.... smh. I dunno. The FUD against Bitcoin is strong right now. The tech isn't failing or dying or vaporware, there are just a lot of rich people both in USD and BTC/BCH/ALTS that want to have THEIR way... but Bitcoin doesn't care. It's a honeybadger. FUD away. :)
Well under 100 can't be orders of magnitude more expensive. It can at most be **an** order of magnitude, but not multiples. Even so, we are still talking about at most 50c, and comparing it to a chain which is significantly less used.
"> The reality is BCC never had much usage and many blocks are still under 50 kB

The reality is Bitcoin Cash already has 10% of BTC, and already more than old established coins like Dash and Monero. 

"
"> This is true across the whole market due to

... due to the unspellable BS strategy (fee market) of BS/Core."
"> First: There's more than 10 times the transactions on BTC chain than BCH chain. Transaction volume has gone down on both, so I don't see it being directly related to high fees.

At the moment, the blocks aren't full -- and when blocks aren't full the limit is irrelevant.  However, you only need look back to the time (scant months ago) when blocks _were_ full to see that it was a serious problem.  And it is that time that has scared off merchants.  Bitcoin was booming, had huge media presence and yet they couldn't take orders or their new-Bitcoin-using customers were being asked for large percentage fees for small item purchases.  Do you not accept that that will have had an effect on adoption?

> And making more effective use of the block space you have is a far more important task to work on.

We'll have to agree to disagree then, because my feeling is that Bitcoin is getting slowly strangled by prioritising technical navel gazing over user adoption.  If you've ever talked to anyone who's _not_ already one of the enlightened, it's a hard enough sell as it is.  Bitcoin is a dirty word -- the mainstream media mostly hate it and have filled their heads with ""it's only for drug dealers/paedophiles"", ""it's imaginary"", ""it's a scam"", and ""you get arrested for using it"".  The _only_ positive it's got going for it right now (ignoring the gamble of increased value of an investment) is that its transactions are fast and cheap.  When those are not true, exactly what is the selling proposition?  That lightning network will make it good next year, as long as you understand this complicated intermediate layer _and_ Bitcoin?  You'll forgive me if I don't see how to argue for that.

Making more effective use of block space is _absolutely_ a worthwhile goal; but doing that while not simultaneously taking a technically cheap improvement (1MB blocks are embarrassingly small, and the idea that increasing that x10 would be anything other than a negligible cost increase is sophistry) feels awfully like sabotage.  When the average web page is twice the size of the _maximum_ Bitcoin block -- something is very wrong.  You make it sound like the work on LN would have to stop in order for the block limit to be raised.  If BCH only did one thing it's that it demonstrated that raising the limit is possible fairly easily (and what's more, that work is portable back to BTC if it were wanted)."
I was going to say. No shit usage dropped when mainstream dropped out. lol
Or just increase the block size limit and all of that is not necessary
Which?
amen.

I was just making a joke. Poor Alice, Dave and Bob. They must make like half of all crypto tx. 
I wonder why people are so fond of loose mesh networks, which Nano is and LN aspired to be. Bitcoin is a nearly complete graph, a structure that is many times more robust and far more decentralized in the most important way. Loose meshes are pretty easy to Sybil attack. It's just a matter of time.

Blocks size are not limited. You can fork like BCH did. Unless you only want one chain, with the block size you want. But that's dictatorship
Very well said. I frequent the other sub because I don’t like the cult like shilling of bcash but I agree with everything you said and I’m thankful to see a refreshing post like yours on this sub. 
"First: There's more than 10 times the transactions on BTC chain than BCH chain. Transaction volume has gone down on both, so I don't see it being directly related to high fees.

The technical limits are not that arbitrary. The *costs* of running a full node should be kept low - because economic activity *should* preferably be backed by independent nodes. Letting the miners do the validation of the TXes themselves, all centralized in fewer and bigger mining pools are a slippery slope to ""paypal 2.0"". Now, if paypal were backed by a blockchain, it'd probably be better than the paypal than we have now, but it'd be *far from* a non-censorable global currency.

Imposing limits now are a good idea, because it *is* already a significant cost to run a  full node. But I agree: I am not *that* fundamental ""small-blocker"". I haven't done the full calculations for what a small block size would mean to the economics, but I also believe that it's better to err on the safe side. And making more effective use of the block space you have is a *far* more important task to work on.

"
"The evidence reflects otherwise. Until blocks became full there was little to no pressure for wallets, processors, merchants,  and exchanges to consolodate/batch transactions, adopt segwit, or develop payment channels (what satoshi proposed back in 2010). 

Now everything is different. I.E... Coinbase went from 2 onchain txs per withdrawal > 1 tx per withdrawal > batched txs > batched txs with segwit > and now is developing lightning network 

This would not have happened this quickly with segwit2x bumping the block weight from 4MB to 8MB

HF crude scaling solutions is a sloppy method that delays intelligent scaling"

"You are black-and-whiting, which is a common logical fallacy. Satoshi isn't ""wrong"" or ""right"", he has voiced numerous opinions, ideas, and  hypotheses that each individually have to be valued in terms of right and wrong.

Nano or IOTA.
The whole thing is fairly ridiculous. Other coins have no issue with floating block size. 
Yes, usage was mainly speculative. This just means next time BTC price rises, if ever, it will have huge fees again unless the blocksize is further raised, whereas BCH will not. BTC is adoption-proof. BCH is adoption-ready. Neither are used in a sizable way in commerce yet, though Bitcoin was almost there before the Fidelity Effect kicked in. BCH removed the Fidelity Effect. Your move, BTC.
"Lightning requires 152mb blocks if my memory serves so this whole issue is retarded

"The question was ""why is LN unnecessary?""

The answer you gave was ""Bitcoin nodes were always intended to be limited to the hardware that could support it, not the other way around.""

What I mean by why that logic doesn't apply now is that LN seems to be a way to help achieve your answer. But as I said, maybe I'm missing something.

I'm not arguing for or against LN, I just don't see how your answer really addresses the question unambiguously.
"
"So you really don't understand what these bytes are. Segwit doesn't magically reduce the total size of witness plus tx information. Fees are calculated differently to encourage segwit txs.

"Sounds like you should. I've been here since 2010 reading DAILY for 12+ hours per day... so yeah. You have more seniority than me? I'll back down if you do, but I know you don't. Even Andreas will say what I just said is right. But okay... Fud away.

Edit: Where did you come up with 152mb blocks? Can you even cite me a source that's worth a shit? Because I can cite you the LN ITSELF showing that it takes NO blocks to send from Alice to Bob. The only time the blockchain is needed is when you redeem your LN satoshis for Blockchain satoshis or vice versa, which will become more and more rare as the LN is used for everything commerce-wise."
and your attacking me rather than my points in the top level reply. clever.
LN isn't Bitcoin scaling.  It's a *L2 scaling solution* that can operate on top of Bitcoin.
"Ummm.. .basic math...

1024KB blocks / 192 byte tx min = 5,461.33 tx per block MAX before Segwit

1024KB blocks / 116 byte tx min = 9,039.45 tx per block MAX after Segwit

Looks like 4000 more tx goes through every 10 minutes, which is what the goal is. ANDREAS EVEN CLAIMS SEGWIT was a type of block size increase. Are you dense in not admitting that SEGWIT increases the usable tx space in a block? I just gave you the math above. DEFINITELY takes less storage to store 5,461.33 SEGWIT tx than Legacy TX, that's why MORE tx fit in a block...."
Capitulation was in October at 0.05. I converted those crippled non-cash blegacy joke coins at 0.08. Now its >0.11

But it reduces the load on the Bitcoin network, which is the point being discussed here.

Next time the chain is under load because of limited blocksize, you're going to eat those words.  Remember this when you get there.  You will. 
"exactly. pretty long and steady trend of dropping against btc. Rogers pumps are over and he already dumped most of his btc so cannot continue propping up your alt. It is becoming more and more irrelevant every day . What is most damaging is the destruction of the narrative of low fee txs which is now irrelevant as btc has cheap onchain txs fees and much cheaper LN fees than bcash. 

 now people here have to lie about btc fees to continue the narrative as we see in the OP silly remark"
The point being discussed is why LN is unnecessary.  It's unnecessary because Bitcoin does not have any realistic scaling problems as long as you don't artificially limit it by requiring support for non-mining nodes on low-end hardware on slow Internet connections.
"Then why does Electrum show me that it's 116 bytes when I send a segwit tx?

BS. It bottomed at 0.065 6 days after the fork. Today we are much higher. Dumb money whales already converted their Bitcoin Cash against that ridiculous segregated non-cash non-Bitcoin (BTC). "
"Ok, thanks.

I was seeing increasing blocksize and using LN as two different ways of addressing scaling issues. However, you're giving preference to a blocksize increase by definition.
"
I have no idea. You would need to look more into exactly what that number represents
Can u copy/paste the tx id?
"notice how you are arguing against statements I never made

"I'm sure LN can be an effective scaling mechanism once they work out the kinks.  However, effective is not a synonym for necessary.

Not a perfect analogy, but say we were trying to improve fuel economy for cars and one argument was to just load them all on trains to move them from place to place.

Fuel economy would certainly increase, but then we have to justify why it's so impossible or infeasible to just make cars more fuel efficient that loading them all on trains suddenly becomes the default option, despite completely undermining the concept of what it is to drive a car."

"That's to close every LN channel instead of leaving the BTC in LN (which is also good for the scarcity aspect of Bitcoin, making value go up) Who isn't going to leave their BTC in lightning once it's mainstream and makes it cost nothing to move HALF A SATOSHI OR LESS?

""Lightning is block-size neutral. It requires one on-chain transaction to open a channel between a hub and a client, and one on-chain transaction to close a channel."" - FROM THE PAGE YOU CITED. FIRST SENTENCE. 

Once you load a channel, the Bitcoin never touches the blockchain again UNTIL YOU TAKE THE BTC BACK OUT OF THE CHANNEL. 

The whole point of LN is to get the tx off of the chain and NEED NO SPACE TO SHIFT MONEY. They are timelocked contracts OFFCHAIN. And why would you even need to close a channel in LN if merchants are accepting it? You simply shift that burden to the merchants and let THEM cash out and every person that does that, reduces that blocksize needed in your citations hypothetical scenario.... I don't see the validity of that scenario in your link. That's not how it will work in real life. People will load channels, and leave them loaded. Thos in third world countries that have a couple bucks a week or month, are not going to want to pay anything to get the Bitcoin when they can simply send a LN transaction worth 3 cents to their village store to get their water or food or supplies. The merchants may even be able to use LN with their vendors, keeping THEM from having to pay to switch to BTC.

Also, not saying we don't need to go to maybe 4 or maybe 8 MB blocks someday. But we sure as hell won't need them for YEARS possibly because of Lightning.

Thanks for showing some respect for a person's dedication to this project for 8 years, though. /s"

The only reasons to run a non-mining ""node"" is to check the UTXO set if they are accepting transactions on 0-conf, if you are serving some SPV wallets, or if you are doing blockchain analysis.

The question was whether or not on-chain scaling will cause BCH to face scaling problems in the future.

It won't, because Bitcoin was never intended to be limited by these arbitrary scaling restrictions.  Technology will likely keep up, but even if it doesn't all it means is that Bitcoin nodes will have relatively higher hardware requirements compared to your average consumer system than they do today."

People need to use their brains before their mouths.

Also, the TM fix is HUGE. It allows Bitcoin to now to USE TIME as an indicator of when a tx can be claimed. That's BIG... also, since TM is fixed, I don't know why you need to worry about confirmations. Nobody is going to do a 51% attack on their transaction for coffee or even a HOME... if they had that much mining power, they'd have probably already bought a FEW homes.... it's just stupid.

Another tech will have superseded BTC long before then, rolling out Liquid would just solidify the death of the chain in the eyes of the crypto community.
Could you imagine if there was an energy efficiency war to mine bitcoin rewards at 10 million dollars a coin? Someone would invent energy miracles.

"It isn't that Cash supporters are against LN itself. We are against crippling on-chain scaling to sell second layers privately as solutions, which is what Blockstream has done for the past few years after effectively hijacking the project and pushing the original community out (to here).

There is no reason whatsoever to limit on-chain scaling as is, so we push for that ahead of second layers like LN that ultimately *require* a large block threshold to function. 


"
The real issue has not been to solve scaling for the next 20 years.  It is to fix the immediate problem while looking for better solutions - including L2 solutions.  BTC killed the adoption momentum.
Bitcoin nodes were always intended to be limited to the hardware that could support it, not the other way around.  Check out quotes about Bitcoin server farms from Satoshi in 2010.
"See Bitcoin Cash [end game](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/876thf/the_endgame_for_bitcoin_cash_full_global_adoption/).

"People cried that oil will run out and scaling will destroy Bitcoin.

"Eventually.....not today. Raising the block size works fine while other solutions are developed. Forcing the blocksize to become a problem today so Blockstream could monetize the sidechains is the single dumbest thing I've ever fucking seen. 

They created a problem so they could solve it."
LN isn't the only scaling solution, but anyway, this was debated enough, it's not about the LN, it's about bitcoin being taken over by a hostile company.

"Fraud proofs were merely mentioned as a ""nice to have.""

With that context cleared up, the significance of fraud proofs changes from appearing essential to being merely nifty in some weird edge cases.

"This post is very misleading. 

Do I need to open new payment channels for every new party I want to transact with?

No, the Lightning Network is (thus its name), constructed as a network. Meaning although Alice might not yet have an open payment channel with Dave, Alice is indirectly connected with Dave via Bob, or even using multiple steps in between. With the Lightning Network, users are able to transact with anyone who is connected to their network of payment channels through multiple hops. In theory, everyone should be connected to everyone else through the network via only few nodes. People are also incentivised running these connecting nodes through (small) fees that are paid out every time a transaction uses one of their connections. Early results from the testnet implementation of the Lightning Network confirm that a sufficiently decentralized network indeed can be created.

The architecture of the Lightning network is still trustless (because it is based on smart contracts) and will always make sure that the funds will reach their destination through intermediaries, or issue a refund if there is no indirect path to the destination possible.

LTC or ETH are also trying out lightning network. I wonder why.."

I would say *that* is backwards. You want your product to work *right now* **while you are searching for a long term solution**.
"If there's only five people using BTC because it adoption stopped (and momentum is hard to get back for new products) it won't matter that it's capable of serving seven billion people...

Do you not agree that there are practical aspects to getting the world to adopt a new form of money over and above either side's technical arguments?  All those people who were advocates of Bitcoin within merchants now look like idiots, and when they say ""we should implement LN"" will have no social capital to burn precisely because Bitcoin's failure to scale _now_ let them down.

That block sizes can't be increased forever is not an argument that they shouldn't be increased a little bit.  There is a lot of grey between the black and white of 1MB or 10000GB.  And in fact, if you want to avoid creating perverse incentives, it's better that block sizes are allowed to increase with economics as the limiting factor rather than arbitrary centrally-imposed technical limits.

It's the exact analogous situation to that of a central bank deciding interest rates and what the money supply should be -- it's simply not possible for any centralised party to have enough information to know the ""right"" value.  Free-markets are better at managing resource scarcity through the price mechanism.  Capital controls, and supply side limiting _always_ fail relative to simply letting the market find its own level.

In Bitcoin-land that means that you should (in the end) be able to buy more block space for your transaction by increasing the fee.  That's only possible if block sizes aren't limited arbitrarily but are limited by what miners will accept and what they want in exchange.  Further: that only really becomes relevant when we're well into the adoption curve, and we're well into the supply curve -- neither of which have happened yet, so why on Earth would imposing limits now be a good idea?"
Increasing the block size shouldn't interrupt development of second layer solutions. Actually, it's quite the opposite: the more adoption we get the more resources the ecosystem will have to develop more sophisticated scaling solutions.
Even with LN we would need blocks much bigger than even 50MBs. So the fact that we had to split to even get 8MB tells me there is something going on beyond the tech.
What nonsense. It's like before the cap was reached BTC maximalists were using it. Why not let exchanges move to other trading pairs and then you won't have any congestion problem at all?
"It absolutely does; you scale it onchain by increasing the blocksize as was intended, up to the practical physical limit."
That assumes there is any serious obstacle to scaling in the first place. 
"Yes Months: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,3m 
"
They haven't been that low for months, weeks maybe. And that's just because people stop using btc
Thata an idiotic reason. You onchain tx is broadcast to everyone... and saved forever. By that logic bitcoin isnt for you becausr chad, steve, lisa, mike, satoshi etc... and every onborn child is not your friend...
That.
"Well,  obviously we should trust our money in new,  complex services that cost more than cheaper,  working alternatives 

Duh. "
r/btc existed long before Bitcoin Cash did fam. Those who were banned from rbitcoin seemed refuge here.
Because this subreddit is about Bitcoin. What's being stolen? 
"> it’s should be called fbtc (fake bitcoin)

Found the trump fanboy. LPT: these sorts of ""disses"" are so childish they're painful to watch."
I already have to keep track of 1) HD wallets, 2) paper wallets, 3) exchange wallets, 4) segwit addresses, 5) legacy addresses.  Apparently adding one more to that existing mess is just a bridge too far.
Feel the salty.
BCash isn't mentioned. You must be in the wrong thread. 
"Thank you for demonstrating the extent of argument that Bitcoin Core (BTC) supporters have against Bitcoin Cash (BCH).  When you have no arguments, you resort to name-calling - we were taught that in elementary school.  
For anyone interested watch this video that explains the extent of arguments from both sides of BTC vs BCH camps.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbvtAlmfYQI
Thank you for starting off this conversation."
No you don't. Yet. 
"[Standing at times square at 2:30am] ""I don't see any traffic, look, there's basically nobody here.... stupid propaganda!"""
It's pointless to have low fees sometimes, for the obvious reason that it is pointless to run a business where you can only operate profitably sometimes, and on an unpredictable schedule, and where your ability to operate is thwarted by your own success. This is the full-small-blocks paradigm in action.
> Still more expensive than Bitcoin Cash
Are the core devs still promising an increase in block size “eventually”? There’s literally no reason not to go to 8mb. 
That would make sense.
"An actual working version that does what LN was promised to do doesn't appear to be on mainnet. We were promised a mesh network, not hub and spoke. We were promised amazing usability, low fees, no possibility for loss of funds, no routing problem. What is on mainnet is something named ""Lightning Network"" that doesn't really resemble the LN we were discussing months ago."
"LN might even work eventually.

The funny part will be when it works better on any other PoW chain except BTC"
This doesn't answer the question of how to scale.
Don’t underestimate the elites. Praying BCH prevails
"That's when they roll out Liquid, and all you have to do is abandon any commitment to decentralization or trustlessness.

Once their backs are to the wall they'll embrace Liquid, because what's left of that community are cult followers, not thinkers.

"Perhaps satoshi got it wrong? He is merely human.

Perhaps he was only referring to mining pools?

Remind me when fraud alerts / proofs that he outlined in the whitepaper exist. "
It is feasible pretty much now. Even [terabyte blocks](https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk) are.
"Good point. The ""peak oil"" and ""blockchains don't scale"" dogmas largely come from the same basic failure to understand incentives. "
"You hit the nail on the head, except you hit it backwards.

The *other* camp, which I firmly belong in, thinks it's much more important to solve scaling for the next 20 years than working on some temporal relief now."
