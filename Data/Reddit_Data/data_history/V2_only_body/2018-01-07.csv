"They had banking problems since at least for the last 3 years and their last known bank account was shut down in May. Since then, they switched completely to Tethers from USD, but they seem to deliberately confuse their users because their account balances appear in USD on the site, even though it's in USDT. The company that issues Tethers is owned by the same guy who owns Bitfinex and can issue Tethers on a whim. 1 year ago there were $10 million Tethers, today there are $1.5 billion (in Dec alone they issued over $500 million USDT). They claim Tethers are backed by USD 1-to-1 so in theory they have $1.5 billion dollars somewhere, but they refuse to provide any evidence. They don't even say in what jurisdiction the company is registered in. /r/bitfinex is full of people who complain that they can't move their money at all since late October, and customer support seems to be non-existent.

Cashouts have been stopped. They closed account creation and stopped doing business with US customers (presumably because of the SEC is started to look into exchanges since August). They updated the [Tether ToS](https://tether.to/legal/) and now it literally says that their customers have no right to sue them if they scam them, which is completely ridiculous.

Basically everything they've done in the last 6 months just raised ever bigger red flags, the ToS update 3 days ago is the icing on the cake.

For the nitty gritty details, [this guy](https://twitter.com/bitfinexed) has been informing on bitfinex very closely.

**Edit**: I almost forgot to mention, they claim they were hacked and lost $30 million in October. Despite all these problems, they're somehow the #4 exchange by volume."

"That still doesn't answer 1. How it is going to reduce on-chain TX and 2. Why we need it at all, if fees are low.   I open a channel with 1BTC in it, I have to spend that with one person or business, I can't break it up.  Even if I could, I have no idea why I would open a channel for $20, when I make on average about 1-3 TX per week.  If it really does easily enable small payments, the increase in resulting LN use would equal or exceed the number of TX that it is ""saving"" on-chain, leading to higher fees for BTC.  There is a fundamental flaw here in how blockspace is being issued, and inventing new use cases(or salvaging old ones killed by fees) isn't going to solve the problem."

Hey thanks man really appreciate it. 
Mmm i thimk i see your point but i fail to see where s the financial incentive for them?  I understand the reason for a miner to host a node, but the other full node are mostly hosted by hobbyist and there is already too few of them  on the core chain so I wonder what mechanism would trigger people with more resource to host one?
So centralization to those with more money? 
You got it all backwards... the more difficult it is, the less people will do it. The more resources needed, the more centralized it gets. 
That decreases decentralization.
"I'm saying that someone's hands must always be on the wheel. Even if we created an algorithm that predicts the future, it can't be perfect and thus the wheel is simply controlled based on someone's assumptions from long ago and they refuse to adjust. Decentralization is inherently a myth because of this. As long as a money system needs scarcity to have value control of that scarcity will exist. 

If you do not trust the government or the banks you need to fix those entities. Side channeling a vapor currency is not going to accomplish anything. 

As for gold. 

Well commodity currencies inherently limit the growth of an economy the moment scarcity exceeds the economies needs. If more gold can't be found when the economy needs it the economy turns downwards until it finds more gold. 

This leads to merchantilism and gold and silver wars as well as restrictive trade deals where each country has to keep a tight lid on the amount of gold they have in the system. Otherwise their economy runs out and they see negative effects. 

A decentralized crypto currency that supplants government currency results in an economy which is holey dependant on its supply of crypto which it cannot control. Which will result in massive regulations on crypto use between states and possible hostile trade action to acquire needed crypto. "
Ethereum is not decentralized

"> to have fast payments with low fees, off-chain

U can also use PayPal for that or tippr. Bitcoin p2p txs have trustlessness, in order for payment channels to work without trust congestion shall go away - bigger blocks once again are needed. LN can work like Counterparty before overloads, but can't work with 150k+ txs in the mempool. Addition to the system, not a replacement for p2p

> shooting at me

Such as?"
I can't understand the positive economic effects of even having a Fed.
"> But not on chain

If you don't mind going through an off-chain centralized payment processor then why not use something like BitGold instead?

Gold mining is a lot less centralized than bitcoin mining, and you're not reliant on the continued co-operation of gold miners for it to stay valuable.

At least that legally entitles you to physical gold which would still be useful even if the entire gold market collapsed.

>And then what is the solution? Another hardfork to create even bigger blocks? And then what, we will have a 3 way battle of the small blockers, medium blockers and large blockers? Or will BCH hard fork and have one group implement even bigger blocks, while the BCH guys try to find second layer solutions?

None of them are going to work long term, but raising blocksize works better in the short term than not doing so. Lightning can be made to work for BCH as well as BTC, so it confers no unique advantage to BTC. It's still going to cost more to open a channel in BTC.

Nothing actually useful is going to come out of crypto until people stop measuring success in price."
"To verify 0-conf transactions and even blocks.

Exchanges have their own nodes because this is an absolute requirement and large businesses that need to verify payments coming in need to."
"It may be less as a percentage of total users, but also be more in absolute terms.  Pulling numbers out of my ass for an example, if the percentage that runs a node goes from 10% to 7%, but the total userbase doubles, then the total number of nodes is still higher, because 7% of 2x is larger than 10% of 1x.  And bear in mind that in terms of the network being secure against attack, it is the absolute number of full nodes that matters, not the number as a percentage of the total userbase.

On top of that, you have to remember the end goal is not decentralization, it is the security of the network.  Decentralization is the means to that end.  And that security is for **people**.  If nobody can use Bitcoin, it doesn't matter how secure and decentralized it is, because people cannot take advantage of it.  If Bitcoin with slightly larger blocks would still be decentralized enough to withstand any attack against it, then keeping the blocksize below that threshold serves only to hurt adoption and provides no security benefit.

Bitcoin must be decentralized *enough* to withstand any attack, and it also must be cheap enough that the vast majority of people can afford to use it.  Otherwise, it's entire purpose (freeing people) is compromised."
How the fuck does more nodes = centralization?

">I open a channel with 1BTC in it, I have to spend that with one person or business, I can't break it up.

That's just a payment channel. The lightning network allows for payments that jump through multiple channels.

>Even if I could, I have no idea why I would open a channel for $20, when I make on average about 1-3 TX per week.

I used to buy games on Steam with Bitcoin, before it got too expensive. Even without taking advantage of LN's routing, I could open a $200 channel with Steam and I'd be good for a year or two, with instant transactions whenever I wanted to buy a game.

>If it really does easily enable small payments, the increase in resulting LN use would equal or exceed the number of TX that it is ""saving"" on-chain, leading to higher fees for BTC.

No, because each channel only needs two on-chain transactions, the opening and the close. So in my previous example after the third Steam purchase LN would already be saving at least 1/3 of the transactions from hitting the blockchain. "
Two participants create a ledger entry on the blockchain which requires both participants to sign off on any spending of funds. Both parties create transactions which refund the ledger entry to their individual allocation, but do not broadcast them to the blockchain. 
It's decentralised with side two party agreements.
"The best estimate we have on the network topology of LN are from the LN testnet. [Here](https://medium.com/@murchandamus/a-look-at-an-early-ln-testnet-topology-a874a6ff41d9) is a blogpost where you can see visualization of the LN testnet with commentary. In my opinion this network is not at all becoming the pure ""hub and spoke"" that many have been claiming it would become.

Most importantly, LN will not introduce counterparty risk and it will not affect the decentralization of the base layer.

What sort of impact LN will have on on-chain fees is very hard to tell. Some people claim with certainty that it will solve all problems and others claim it won't have any effect. I think both are ignorant. It's obviously not going to be a ""quick fix"" that alleviates everything from day one but it will (regardless of impact on on-chain fees) create a lot of utility for Bitcoin as it allows cheap, trustless off-chain transactions after opening a channel or two. 

This utility (and usage of the LN) obviously only comes as it is adopted. This could happen depressingly slow (as with SW) or a lot faster. What it has going for it, that SegWit doesn't, is that it doesn't matter what other people do. If 10% uses SW, the effect on the mempool is minimal and thus fees stay high even for the ones using it (although of a bit lower for them). With LN, the users aren't affected in any way by the non-users, incentive for businesses that are doing low-value transactions to adopt it will be huge. Especially early on, as I'm sure there will be many more users wanting to use it than businesses accepting it.

Regardless of your scaling preferences I think you should be excited by these innovations even if you think they have been used as an excuse for doing what you would have preffered (raising the base block size on Bitcoin)."

"Here’s the thing, you’re led to believe a block limit maintains decentralization.. of NON MINING NODES.  Which are essentially useless to the network and the average user.  If you allow the blockchain to grow and the bitcoin economy to flourish there will ALWAYS BE ENOUGH nodes to keep the network decentralized enough so no single entity can change consensus rules. Think about it, it’s a global currency, meaning at least every country can afford at least one node. 
People worry about possible mining centralization because of jihan and asic boost, but MINING CENTRALIZATION IS HAPPENING ON CORE.  Small miners are all migrating to Bitcoin (Cash) because it doesn’t make sense to pay ridiculous fees to withdraw their earnings. 
Sorry but you’ve been brainwashed through insane censorship and manipulation.. carry on."
">If you want to look at this rationally, you need to be realistic about what other people's positions are. We're talking about the connection between block size and decentralization.

And my point was that the same people who's position is that BCASH allows for intolerable levels of centralization are the same people saying Lightning will fix all bitcoins problems, which requires an even higher level of centralization to work.

>In the last 24 hours the bitcoin blockchain processed 350,727 transactions worth about $3.9 billion.

>You say ""unusable"", but I don't think you know what that word means.

It's unusable as a currency. How many of those $3.9 billion of transactions were people buying goods and services and how many were buying and selling in fiat to speculate on future increases in value?

Food stamps?
Yeah RVer said he wants to use the Core team's code.
It's a network of two-party ledger entries. That means it is possible to find a path across the network similar to routing packets on the internet.
~~That's not how it works~~, but LN has some other problems, for starters transactions are only final once they reach the blockchain, so it's more susceptible to attacks. For example in your example Bob could use his channel with you to pay a lot of money to different accounts and close his channel without propagating any of those transactions to the main chain, and immediately transfer his funds to another address, which basically makes it so that every transaction he made in the LN is worthless.
That's not how it works. In your example, the coffee shop is paying Carol. I'm not sure why that is happening.
Why is Bitfinex going down?
My man 
But then the other side would be upset because they would be the fork.   So like it's a no win situation if people can't just let it go and focus more on the positive of building their respective coins
What isn't resolved? Didn't the split mean each party is continuing development the way they each choose? 
Haven't they already hijacked the crypto away from the original design, though? Otherwise BCH wouldn't be a thing.
Except segwit is opt in. You don't have to use it to make a transaction so..

"With greater adoption, people with better resources at hand can host nodes.
"
"Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. "
I run a full node on a crappy cable connection. I just reduced the number of nodes connectable (bitcoind connects to way too many nodes by default in my opinion (especially for non-mining nodes) and this makes inefficient use of bandwidth and also makes you more vulnerable to certain forms of attack) and I also throttled the connection (using tc.sh) since bitcoin traffic is very bursty which is not good if you are using the connection for other things.
Your node isn't helping decentralisation.
Are you saying decentralization is a stupid goal because it depends on an algorithm that will become outdated? What are the main reasons we left gold? I'm glad we did--but why are you? 
It worked for Ethereum. More nodes than BTC, using more resources.

Because Bitcoin is decentralized and has what users crave.
"Not my argument, but what I’ve heard is that it would create conditions in which not everyone could run full nodes. The less people able to run full nodes would lead to an increase in centralization. 

My thing is that no one has been able to say EITHER WAY what the effect WILL be. Maybe it will maybe it won’t. "
Absolutely. The most decentralized most unusable project has to have a nice 1 byte per year blocks. It'll work like magic
"Only if you forget that the ""demand"" half of ""supply and demand"" exists."
I really see a huge part of the technical community backing up the data.

">Just saying ""but lightning""

If you want to look at this rationally, you need to be realistic about what other people's positions are. We're talking about the connection between block size and decentralization.

>whilst letting bitcoin become unusable

In the last 24 hours the bitcoin blockchain processed 350,727 transactions worth about $3.9 billion.

You say ""unusable"", but I don't think you know what that word means.
"
I love it, but it's just not a very good movie.
"That’s why people are working on other solutions on top of the base chain...: to have fast payments with low fees, off-chain. Your argument doesn’t hold because you’re assuming all transactions would be on chain. Good try though. I bet a lot of people in here will fall for you argument.

And before you start shooting at me: I don’t care about bigger blocks, 2nd level, 3rd level debates. Both sides are now acting irritational anyways. What I do know is that there’s a lot of misinformation on this particular reddit."
So you think there's only ever a remote probability of a price change affecting a market, rather than the usual supply and demand model?
"> I would love to see an explanation as to why 8MB blocks increase centralization. But so far I just read people repeating that it does without any backup whatsoever.

I see both. That’s the whole problem. Half the people say it will increase centralization, the other half say it won’t. Neither have the data to back it up. "
"You are correct. Both supply and demand are subject to diminishing returns and consumer psychology, and are not straight lines. It seems to me that there is a balance to be found between the fees being high enough that it incentivizes mining, and low enough that enough people can participate in the system.

The block size is a matter of monetary policy.

This whole circle jerk is basically a bunch of people who are on a crusade because they want the interest rate at 1%, The Fed set the interest rate at 2%, and they can't understand the positive economic effects of the higher rate... all they know is that it costs them more than they wish they could pay. 

EDIT: it's also important to note that none of these coins exist in a vacuum. The fact that other coins fill some markets means bitcoin can focus somewhere else. Bitcoin couldn't be what it is and be successful if bitcoin cash didn't exist, and bitcoin cash couldn't be what it is and be successful if bitcoin didn't exist.

Markets need competition. There's no reason to suspect that there is a conspiracy and fraud happening, simply because my favourite product hasn't risen to 100% market share."
"> decentralization ""strength"" increases as more people/locations participate

Nope. It depends only on the amount of miners (**hashes**, to be precise) and has nothing to do with amount, intentions, personhood and geograpical location of owners. Game theory!

To see how decentralized Bitcoin is today, count the number of zeros in the last block's hash"
"But not on chain. And if it doesn't work, then either they will need to create something else, or they will fail and an alt will take over.

Fact is, BCH faces the exact same problem as BTC currently faces. If BCH ever started getting more traffic, eventually the 8mb block size will face the same problems as the 1mb block size.

And then what is the solution? Another hardfork to create even bigger blocks? And then what, we will have a  3 way battle of the small blockers, medium blockers and large blockers? Or will BCH hard fork and have one group implement even bigger blocks, while the BCH guys try to find second layer solutions?

If a solution isn't found to keep the block size to a minimum, then BTC, BCH and any fork based on it won't be able to scale.

Increasing block sizes is just a band aid."
Wandered in here from /all, I'm only mildly familiar with crypto concepts and got a great chuckle since I knew the movie and general ideas.
Yeah but I have lightning network so my brain Is faster! 
How can you tell he has a larger hashrate? 
"But what prevents whomever it is from spamming the new block size and filling it up? Sure it would cost more to spam so many transactions but it could be done.

Then were right back with it needing something else to fix it, except this time it's forked AFTER everyone adopted so now they'll have two Bitcoin wallets they dont know how to use."
I'm not a core supporter. I hate both subs equally.
"Haha I get it my man.  I understand bcash is less expensive and faster.  Just the community is overall vitriolic and reading through the sub is like a hate train.  It's ravenous.  And *everyone* I know thinks that.  This market is sentiment driven and I would think that constant haterade is a bad look and may cause a portion of people turn away. 
Not to mention if you really want to transact and move money around, ltc is the least expensive and fastest. ETH has the trading pairs. BTC has the big dick. It just is what it is. 
You would think the community, and especially their leader, wasn't in an *attack* mode at nearly every step. That website shit is cheap.  The name. Stand out on *your* merits. 
I'm not hating, I bought some and used it to check it out. It's just fine in utility, less expensive and faster. For transactions it is way better. Just honestly, it is beat in its class for utility and hodling value "
20th Century Fox basically set that movie up to fail. No advertising, no advance screenings for critics, a very limited release, etc.
Nah, It flopped because i had no electrolytes, and lightning network
It got mixed reviews, I wouldn't say it was well received 
TRX seems to die down a bit, maybe people realizing its only hype?
"Whats the movie i cant place it, looks so familiar!


Edit: my question and the name of the movie are oddly ironic.   *hangs head in shame*"
I know what a compromise is, but  can explain to me (without condescending intonation) what you are meaning exactly
Seriously I don't understand. So this is a fight to have the miners?  What about those mining other currency types. Why are only btc core miners important to convert 
"Is this Bitcoin?

Can I send what you sent me to a Bitcoin address???"
"It's to early to make judgments about Satoshi's vision. From his writings it's very clear that he never intended Bitcoin to be about high transaction fees and long transaction times. Otherwise explain to me why bitcoin.org says what it says? So let's give Satoshi is original vision another year or 10 and then maybe we can make a judgment.  I have read everything Satoshi ever wrote --> http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/

"
"without support from core developers, many who are employed by blockstream, it is very difficult. Jeff Garzik tried very hard to follow through on the deal, and blockstream torpedoed him with fud, lies, and attacks.   
  
BCH didnt really take off until blockstream trashed the 2x upgrade, and thats when I finally relized they were never going to change their tune,and thats when I bought BCH"
They realized they'd been had and that BCH already did what they wanted with less fuss.
"I’m not going to call you crazy, but I still don’t see how the hypothetical spam attack achieves this goal. 

The reason people are currently paying 500 s/byte to get quick confirmations has nothing to do with the 100,000 transactions with less than 10 s/byte in the backlog. People are competing with the 30,000+ other transactions that already have high fees, and with the thousands of people adding new expensive transactions every 10 minutes.

An actual spam attack to force up fees would get very very expensive, very quickly, because at least some of the spam would get confirmed meaning the attacker bleeds away their money paying high fees just to damage the network. Conducting the same sort of attack with say 8MB of blockspace is vastly more expensive.

Consider how much vitriol is directed at BCH from highly skilled, well resourced Bitcoin devs. Do you think that they aren’t killing the BCH chain with spam because of ethics? No, it’s because it would drain their resources before we saw anywhere near the problems BTC is seeing at the moment."

I've told you what I meant when I said its becoming useless and you aren't disagreeing with what I meant, just the choice of word.

Now you're saying ""but buying and selling is using it"" even though its clear from context I was talking about use as currency, as if I was somehow ignorant to the massive speculation going on on bitcoin, that some people describe this as ""using"" bitcoin, and it now completely overturns my worldview now I realize people are actually using bitcoin by buying it for fiat and then selling it for fiat without using it for anything else.

 If you want me to go back and edit the original post to be more specific, even though it was clear from context what I was talking about, I can do, but I don't see what difference it would make since you already know what I meant you just don't like the exact phrasing. you would still need to actually address the point rather than try to win a completely meaningless semantic point.

Buying and selling something isn't the same thing as using something. If you can't tell the difference let me know and I can explain it."

No, because it is the sane response to increased usage and resultant high fees. Is bitcoin forever going to have a 1MB block? A larger block size also improves bitcoins miserable energy efficiency.

"> None of this necessitates centralization

So less nodes = more decentralization. Got it.

Well yeah, of course it's in theory, but it's most likely to happen if BCH's only solution is to just keep increasing blocksize. It's similar to the freeway problem. There are always traffic jams on a freeway, so construction starts to add more lanes to the freeway. More people go on the freeway when the new lanes open because ""oh it's probably not as jammed now"". Thus, more people go on the freeway, and when enough people go on the freeway, it becomes jammed again. So construction begins and adds more lanes..."

And I will still tell you that they are irrelevant, because what we are discussing here is a post which misrepresents the theoretical connection between block size and decentralization.

>Currency doesn't just mean something that is bought and sold. Otherwise everything is a currency. How many of those three hundred and fifty thousand times per day was bitcoin being traded for anything other than currency?

You cannot just arbitrarily select one use... a car cannot be used to spread butter on toast therefore cars are useless.

""Useless"" means it has no use. If a thing were actually useless, it would not be used at all. If a thing is used just *one time* for *anything*, it cannot be honestly considered *useless*.

Like c'mon man... you shouldn't need someone to explain what the word ""useless"" means. You're trying to claim a thing, which we both agree has been proven to be in use, cannot be used. Snap out of it.

You can say, ""it can't be used for X,"" however if it can be used for Y, it cannot be said to be ""useless""."

"Hey Bitcoin Cash is changing my life [as an artist](https://soundcloud.com/matthijsbos). I make money as a street artist in Canada. But only in the summer. In the winter my income goes to zero. Now I have been posting some of my piano playing on [yours.org](https://www.yours.org/content/the-story-of-fabian--original-piano-compossition----40f292375a50) and I have gotten tips from other artists. One from Australia who makes drawings and then one more (I forgot). You see the internet allows me to have access to the biggest market in the world. I can spread my music around for almost no money and potentially reach every internet user. But I cannot directly reach their wallets! Well ... now I can.  When I work as a street artist I have a [little hat](https://i.imgur.com/5P4fB3J.jpg) that people trow money in. My hat is now my bitcoin cash wallet on Electron Cash and anybody on the internet that has Bitcoin Cash can come around and trow 10 cents in it. And that .... was not possible before Satoshi. That can be life changing for a lot of artists like me. 




Man if only soundcloud would work with tips or if somebody would build a soundcloud version that works just like yours.org then .... I would probably be able to make music full time and have enough money each month to live. Check out my music, It will always be free. I have had my bitcoin vanity address on my soundcloud page since 2011 and the little bits and pieces of Bitocin I have received are now worth about 400 dollars. Well, I sold that a couple of weeks ago so now I am bitcoin core free. 

Now I am going to save money for a car because then I can travel to bigger cities in the summer.

">So less nodes = more decentralization. Got it.

There is some kind of mental step that isn't obvious to me. Just because a Kalahari bushman can't run a node doesn't mean that other full nodes won't be able to run."
"It's Bitcoin Cash, which shares significant amounts of code and address conventions. 

This balance is linked to the BCH chain, which you now have full access to. 

This balance would be useless on the BTC chain because it is soooooooo much less than the minimum transaction fee. Rest easy though, fees are less than a penny on BCH, so it's not a problem. 

Enjoy this tiny amount of useable crypto!"
">It's to early to make judgments about Satoshi's vision. From his writings it's very clear that he never intended Bitcoin to be about high transaction fees and long transaction times. 

I agree, I don't think it's anyone's vision to make Bitcoin about high transaction fees (including the ""evil"" Bitcoin Core developers).

>So let's give Satoshi is original vision another year or 10 and then maybe we can make a judgment.

If you define Bitcoin Cash as Satoshi's vision, you'll get to see it play out there.

>I have read everything Satoshi ever wrote --> http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/

Good for you I guess, although I'm not a fan of religious following/interpretation of relatively old writings (when considering how far this space has come) as some absolute truth.


At the end of the day, users with nodes define what they see as Bitcoin, there is nothing you, me, Jihan or Bitcoin Core can do to change what software people run. Everyone is free to change what software they run, blaming others for not changing to what you believe is better however, seems like a waste of time."

"I can't dumb it down any more. 

We will have to leave it here.

Until you need it, until there’s an attack, until something happens to a big percentage of them, until you need to release an urgent patch and might test down all the network. Nodes go down all the time. Until you want to finally use your coins and make a transaction using a trusted node.
"The fuck is with your attitude? I have a pretty nice system, 6TB of storage, a nice upload, however, with the rising blockchain size and constant data being uploaded, it's not affordable for me.

You clearly have no fucking idea what you're on about, so I'm out. Peace.

Just FYI, let's say we have 10,000 nodes. If me and the other guy stop running our nodes, that's 2 nodes gone. As far as I'm aware, 10,000 - 2 = 9,998. Overall node count went down for a bit. Once system requirements rise further, it will eventually level off, and then start dropping.

His post is a sign of others stopping as well due to bandwidth. Read my post man. You're clearly wrong here. It's basic logic in cryptocurrency, less nodes = more centralization. As the blocksize increase in the future for BCH, it will only get worse.

An extreme example, but one that hopefully gets my point across more effectively (keep in mind this scale of storage won't happen anytime soon, but for the average person, uploading several hundred gigs weekly is not affordable, which is why I stopped running my full node):

Eventually the blockchain will grow to 200GB, 300GB, 400GB, 600GB, 1TB, 2TB, etc. and blocksize increases means you're uploading more data constantly to various other nodes. This means that my 600GB weekly will rise constantly with future blocksize increases. Can you eventually afford to run a Google storage server? (This is the extreme example, so scale it down from a corporation to an average person) A Google data center is hundreds of Exabytes of data, being trasmitted constantly. Can the average person in the future afford maybe 10TB of storage for a full node?"

A currency that no one uses to buy and sell goods and services is not a useful currency.

Bitcoins only real use case as currency was in black markets and its already being replaced for that because there are better alternatives that work quicker, cheaper and more reliably.

I'm not saying Dogecoin you can use any other crypto coin there. But someone would need hundreds of millions if not billions to buy miners and organize spam attacks etc. But if you controlled the crypto of the future that sort of thing would be worth the billion up front now.

Think of it like the average guy investing and hitting a moonshot. In this case it's a government or corporation that will control the currency of the future. Nobody should have that control that's the whole point of Bitcoin, but with enough effort, today you could get a 51% setup.

So what. If the interested parties actually wanted to follow through with segwit2x they would have. 
We will make some more that movie Idiocracy is very applicable to the bitcointology cult. The idea came from my frustration with interacting with dutch people on tweakers.net (no it's not about meth). Some don't even speak proper english yet they are trowing all these buzzwords around. It really got to me when I realized that Core prograganda reached as far as as website I call my home. I have been a member there for over 10 years with 7000 posts and know many many people. They recently finally made a special theme fora for crytpo currency. But the people that moderate that sub totally fell for core prograganda. I mean they don't censor or anything, they are just deceived. And every frontpage article about Bitcoin (lately that has all been negative) they go around to do damage control and it's always the same story: Segwit, Ligthning Network etc etc. Core really managed to convince a large number of people all over the internet that a blocksize increase is the worst possible thing that can happen to Bitcoin. You can say those core developers are shitty people (some of them) but they know propaganda and cencorship, they are very good at it. Makes me think some outside influence it behind it ... but what do I know. Also this whole character assassination of Gavin with Craig Wright ... maybe one day we will know the truth. But like I said before ... now that Bitcoin Cash is doing really good ... it's time we just slowly start forgetting about Bitcoin Core and leave those people in the little hell they created for themselves.

Well, the more mass adoption you get, less new adopters are interested in being nodes. I’m also pulling numbers out of my ass, but I’d bet you less than 1% of anyone that bought crypto for the first time last month is opening its own full node. Last month or last 3 months.

"The problem is as I outlined. 

If you can manipulate the scarcity of a currency outside of a perfect algorithm then that means it is a centralized currency held by a private entity. 

And yes. Not everyone who hates banks and governments is an edge lord just like not every atheist is one. 

The key is you can hate government and banking without throwing logic out the window and assuming that any measure that excludes those entities is vastly preferable. 

People forget that banks are private entities who work in a close relation to the government because of the past transgressions of banks and private currencies that cause the government's to have an active compulsion to protect the people from private money changers. 

The government in theory is our most accountable and least private entity we can put in charge of handling money supply for the good of a nation. This is a system that was adopted after numerous countries citizens grew tired of private individuals screwing over the economy of a nation. 

Thousands of years of study, governance, finance etc have lead us to where we are. It is a result of attempting to find the most safe and suitable system for money's we can. Crypto fundamentally rolls back this advancement to before the colonial era because people who don't understand the history or function of government don't like their current government and want to destroy it. 

That's pretty edgelordy. 

Basically someone invented a neat technology for preventing replication of a digital token and said hey digital money and a bunch of anarchocapitalists latched on to it and said fuck the banks we free now, ignoring any possible logic or context which actually justifies banks or government. "

"Well that person could use Bitcoin before and they can use BCH now. 
"
"Right.

The way I see it: People have time preferences that do not match what Bitcoin is able to provide. The easiest answer is for individuals to reduce volume of trading by going to a secondary altcoin, which they would do naturally if nothing else changed, and honestly nothing should be changed to a crypto other than security fixes if there wasn't already a plan at the beginning to implement growth adjustments, because when you start tinkering beyond a blueprint you tend to get situations where factions form. 

We have two versions of bitcoin diverging from one another. Bad management of BTC, deviating from the design, is what I believe caused this to happen. BCH developers may be considering taking liberties to correct for issues, but this is the sort of thing you need tons of foresight to deal with succinctly in order to maintain the integrity of the money property of a crypto so that it behaves in a way that one can rely on. If that's not your goal as a developer then you're in it for the wrong reasons. The goal is not, or should not be success of the crypto against all comers by any means, which I think is what BTC has started to become (along with its alarming ties to banking interests which indicates it is being coopted)."
"There is nothing wrong with that. Supply and demand isn't a very easy concept to understand.

Remember that my main point is to object to misrepresentation and argument from incredulity... the idea that because one cannot understand a thing necessarily makes that thing invalid.

Higher fees incentivize people to mine, which provides a larger supply of transaction processing. Higher fees also discourages people from using the currency, for obvious reasons. Thus, if the fees are too large no one makes any transactions -- if the fees are too small no one confirms any transactions.

The most efficient balance between the two depends on the conditions of the market, but it is a balance of supply and demand.

What would happen if core set the block size *too* small? Transaction fees would rise *too* high, and *too few* people would use the system for it to be sustainable. What would happen if core set the block size *too* large? Transaction fees would fall *too* low, and there would be *too* unprofitable for anyone to mine for the system to be sustainable.

Someone saying ""I sold 1000 cheeseburgers at $5 each, and now I have $5000. If I raise the price of my cheeseburgers to $1000, I'll make $1,000,000!"" has forgotten to also consider the demand part of supply and demand."

>It's unusable as a currency.

It's literally used. I don't understand how you can look at a thing that is used three hundred and fifty thousands times per day and describe it as ""unusable"".

It's insane. I don't know what else to say.

"If you are making money selling cheeseburgers for $2, why not raise the price to $2.25 and make more money? When you're making more money, why not $2.50?

The answer is that in your analysis of a commodity's supply, you have forgotten to also consider demand.

First of all, remember what my position here is: *this post misrepresents the argument it is criticizing*. You have also fallen into the same trap.

>Why is 1.1MB blocks unsafe?

No one is arguing that 1.1MB are unsafe. My understanding is that the theory is that the smaller the block is, the more scarce successful transactions become, the higher the transaction fee becomes, the more incentive there is to mine.

I am not saying it is a good or correct theory. I am saying that it is not invalidated by an appeal to incredulity. In order to criticize something, one has to be realistic about what it is."

Why run a node if u only hodl?
I agree completely... but *some* of these new users will run nodes.  Not many, sure, but some.  And again, it's the absolute numbers that count.  More users doesn't put any additional strain on the network (assuming full blocks), so any additional nodes by new users is a plus.  The question is whether the big jump in hardware resources will kill off enough nodes that *all future new users* won't offset that difference.  And to me, it seems obvious that that will almost certainly not be the case.  Some small percentage of users will, and it will almost certainly be enough to offset those who stopped running them solely because of the increased burden.
"> If people such as gustubru can't run a node with high blocksize limits due to bandwidth (and eventually HDD space), then other people will also stop running nodes. 

None of this necessitates centralization

>Eventually running a full node will become so resource intensive with HDD space and bandwidth that fewer people can afford to run nodes.

This is a slippery-slope fallacy.

Just because some theoretical result may happen in the future according to some metric that has yet to manifest, is not a reason to provide slight scaling today.

True, but there's no counterparty risk so they might be fine with only closing channels when they need the money.

>excellent second layer solutions are already available - visa, PayPal, and others.

All with counterparty risk and the ability to freeze your account and censor your transactions. 

Visa also has tons of credit card fraud that costs a lot of money to businesses when chargebacks happen. "
Sure, if they needed it they could close it sooner. But again, even 3 transactions per channel is already a win.
It's not even that. At best, it's a solution for micropayments that has been hyped for political reasons as being a scaling solution for all transaction types.
Ah, ok, for big businesses, good too know. I always thought people in here were not aware of the impact of ever increasing block size. Thanks for sharing.

This is your opinion, I disagree.

>I am not agains offchain solutions or whatever anybody wants to build on top of bitcoin but don't cripple the baselayer with your shitty blocksize limit that was never intended to still be there 10 years later.

Good, going off-chain is inevitable IMO.

>So now Bitcoin Cash can grow until the blocks are getting full, and whatever off chain solution is available by then can be implemented. In fact they can ALL be implemented and the market will show us which one users want to use. Bandwith and data storage is cheap, especially for big businesses for bigger blocks is not the end of the world. Even Satoshi said that himself when talking about the blockchain.

Yes, similarly the market will decide whether the ability for normal people being able to fully validate the network is important or not. And it is up for the people running nodes to decide what they accept as being Bitcoin.

>Even Satoshi said that himself when talking about the blockchain.

Satoshi said a lot of stuff, you seem to only care about the stuff that compliments your narrative. Regardless, I think Satoshi himself would agree that we should not blindly follow his words regardless of new information. Becoming dogmatic about the whitepaper and constantly reffering to Satoshi as some divine authority is in my opinion not very unscientific and not necesarilly the best long-term approach to scaling the network.

"Is this the level of this sub? Two lies in one sentence. It was hardly a compromise, who was at that meeting? And it also isn’t just blockstream who said fuck you. 

Furthermore, none of these companies have implemented segwit on their services, up to today. So they would get bigger blocks and then just keep doing their business without implementing segwit. On top of that, their fork would have been a disaster because it was programmed by a guy who couldn’t even get the code right for the fork.

This is why some people are sceptic about Bitcoin Cash, not because of the idea, but because of the people promoting it. You’re trying to convince people by spreading misinformation, lies and one-sided arguments."

How would it increase the decentralisation? I use to host a full node 1 year ago... but the bandwidth made me stop after a month or two (was running it on a small cable 50/10 but I could still fill the impact on my video game latency). I now have optical fiber 100/10)  but I am still hesitating to host a full btc node considering that the block size increase probably mean I am also going to have a bandwidth usage increase while my upload capacity has not increased... the size of the blockchain does not scare me but the bandwidth usage does.

Is it wrong to think that increasing block size is good but if we do it before we have much higher segwit adoption then sites like Coin base, GDAX and wallets like Mycelium will never invest the resources needed to upgrade to Segwit?

As it stands the pressure is on the big applications to adopt segwit but raise the blocksize now and then they will wait years and hold up Mimble Wimble, Bullet Proofs, and Zsnarks and of course Lightening and all the other awesome stuff segwit allows.

Its not that Im against a bigger block... But of we do it now then the pressure is off for the big guys to adopt segwit.

Like Local Bitcoins just announced its using Segwit... That will get us above 10% soon... One good mobile wallet and coin base and bang we got enough to increase block size"
Don’t ask BTC to raise blk size.  Large blk size is now with bitcoin cash. Period.  We should see the small blocksize experiment run to its conclusion.  Maybe they will be right maybe not. Time will tell.  BTC having a small blk size is good for big blockers for many reasons besides the size. Bch also has a less toxic environment, no censored forums, no brilliant-jerk developers.  If BTC raises block size it will really dampen bch progress and we will be stuck with a toxic censored community that is BTC.

To have a currency you must trust its controller. Your choices are:

* An elected body of officials who are accountable to a society provided that society is diligent enough to actually care. 

* An unelected private for profit entity with the power to manipulate currency. 

* An unelected nonprofit company with power to manipulate currency.

* A computer algorithm which cannot be changed to adjust to market changes or time. 

Two of these options create an open incentive for corruption and manipulation with little to no repurcussions. 

One of them simply cannot prevent itself from stifling the currencies economy unless you think we have solved economics down to the price of tea in 2342.

All of which have been tried and tested and over and over again one prevailed. A centralized, non private currency managed by the government. 

Bitcoin isn't new. It's digital gold. There is a reason we left gold as a currency. In fact there are tons of reasons we did. We've had private currencies and they were gotten rid of in favour of currencies that couldn't be manipulated by private entities for profit. We've had commodity currencies and they create merchantilism, war, and put a hard cap on economic transactions when scarcity becomes an issue. 

Bitcoin is a meme stock in a digital version of a dinosaur currency fueled entirely by high risk speculators and anti bank edgelords.

That being said. The technology has some interesting implications. Crypto can work. And might in the future be how digital currency exists entirely. But not in its current form. "

"It works best if you just have 1 hub that everyone connects to.

Otherwise known as a centralized network.

There's a reason meshnet internet never took off."
Well that is good news for Bitcoin Cash because we don't have a base layer we crippled on purpose and so LN will always work better on Bitcoin Cash than on Bitcoin core. And LN is open source as far as I know. 
Great job but scrolled too fast 
"My gripes with LN are:

1. You have to pay fees for every hop in the network, so the plan is to create Lightning ""hubs"" that everyone connects to. Hubs located in the US and other regulatory countries will need to abide by regulatory law. If the government decides to shut down Bitcoin some day, it will be as easy as forcing a handful of US companies to shut down their hubs. 

2. You need an always online computer with your private keys to maintain a channel. If you want to move your funds into cold storage, or even if you go on vacation for too long, you have to pay more on-chain fees to re-establish the channel. 

3. **No one will use it, even if it's perfect.** Segwit relied on end users upgrading if they wanted a 40% discount on fees. But it's 2018 now and only 8% of active transactions are from Segwit addresses. Miner nodes, which often run the same client and abide by the rules of a handful of mining pools, are easier to upgrade.  >90% of miners were prepared to upgrade to Segwit2x before the FUD campaign brought those numbers down. Even at it's lowest point, 70% of miners were committed to an upgrade. Even developers of Lightning are saying it will take 1–2 years for a significant number of users to actually use LN, and they have no other plans to scale the network in the meantime. 

EDIT: whaddayaknow, the Segwit percentage went down since the last time I checked. Changed 10% to 8%, per http://segwit.party/charts/#"

It changed my view by showing a simple and open integration to multiple platforms. I believed it could be a beautiful thing, but I'd never observed it as such in action.

The safest for you would be to sell your BTC for fiat and keep that in the bank. If BTC crashes you can buy more (if you still want to). There is so much fraud going on with the market prices. There are so many coins that offer no utility and they will eventually crash to zero. It's a matter of time before there is a huge market crash. If you get caught in that ... you might loose a lot.

Have you considered that most people don't want to trade centralization for a short term fix? If Bitcoin was created to decentralize currency as its primary goal, it would make sense to hold off changes that would create accelerated centralization before exhausting other options.

Then, his government started coming after him, because hey, Bitcoin is ""worth"" something now, so taxes, and he had some few deep thoughts about who had his back and didn't, and whether he should really go on with it for something that would only have removed the curtains even faster and exposed the shitfest behind it, devaluating his hopes for bitcoin's value even faster.

Even the devs don't know for a fact what would happen if there was a consensus for a block size increase. We don't know how people react to that kind of change in a network that actually has scale.

In the end, all of this is a thought experiment. We had the last hard-fork in August, we can't keep forking at the flip of a switch. That's not how consensus works and that makes any of those considerations (and this entire stupid war of communities) a simple thought-experiment.

"There is a schism between Bitcoin users. What was one coin has now diverged into two competing coins. There's Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. You need to spend time reading and observing to inform yourself with those details.

I have a few strong opinions and I am only an authority over my own opinions, but they are not specific investment suggestions which you seem to be searching for.

If you are not willing to maintain your own crypto wallet I find it difficult to ever recommend using crypto at all. You must accept the consequence that operating through an exchange means you could pay high fees or even lose your shirt. That said, utility begs that we have a means to exchange and convert our crypto for fiat or other crypto and there's a need for this because doing direct exchanges with others often times feels like the equivalent of bartering. 

That said the prevalence of crypto in society should mitigate and alleviate the need to use an exchange hub for anything other than major transactions. I don't believe the exchange market has matured enough for crypto (not enough healthy competition) and I think it will be a while before it ever does (because of regulatory pressures). 

Most of the people who are new to Bitcoin and speculating on crypto seem to be going to coinbase, and then public sentiment is being conditioned on those types of experiences.

I think there are better, more informed people to ask about this, so post your question to as many places as possible and evaluate what you're hearing. You need more concrete and detail oriented discussions about this subject. "

I have nothing against LN, but they crippled the base layer for no good reason. All they have to do right now is raise the blocksize limit from 1 MB to 2MB and the fees will come down. But core developers can't do that because they would have to admin they where wrong. So now soon we will have Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Obsolete or in other words just Bitcoin again. But I think the name Bitcoin Cash is going to stick from now on. 
If they raise block size, what happens to bch? I kinda don’t want them to think.
Deceptive and wrong posts. LN is vaporware and a lot of the positive posts about it is curated.

"I expect decentralization ""strength"" increases as more people/locations participate, but it is reasonable to conclude there are diminishing returns.

1 person participates. 1 person to stop.
10 persons participate, 10 persons to stop.
100 persons participate, 100 persons to stop, before someone else starts participating.
1000 persons participate, 1000 persons to stop before someone else takes over. (Harder)

If you increased this to millions or billions, it would be very robust. But from a statistical point of view, a similar strength would exist with much lower numbers."
"this really isn't true, with 10,000,000 more users it's likely well have more nodes (which don't contribute to decentralization) and miners (that do) and if we riase blocks we'll lose *maybe 500* full nodes, so it it worth it to gain 1,000 nodes to lose 500 nodes? Or would you rather just breakj the system?

did you know Satoshi said normal users shouldn't run full nodes?

also read this

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. "
"8MB is not so big, in 2009 building a rig to be a node was way more expensive than today, even with 8MB blocks.

Not to mention that Bitcoin is as decentralized as its miners and not its nodes, and mining requires specialized hardware already the cheapest part of which is the storage.

I would love to see an explanation as to why 8MB blocks increase centralization. But so far I just read people repeating that it does without any backup whatsoever."
Yes, and every time it rains it increases the chance of me drowning in an apocalyptic flood. But not by very much.

uh legacy bitocin isn't bitcoin according to most early adopters. with [segregated witness](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gbfuw/a_massive_collection_of_reasons_why_segregated/) is has a very bleak future
"What no one seems to point out, is that increasing the blocksize would actually _increase_ 'decentralization', to a point .... so even if 'decentralization' were the single overridingly most important factor in all of this, the argument is _still_ soo weak.

You've two curves interacting - one is what percentage of users a blocksize increase would put running a full node out of reach for (given their hardware), and the other is the overall usage+userbase increase of a blocksize increase and the corresponding expected increase in users running full nodes. 

At the current blocksize, an increase of say 4x would quickly 4x the amount of usage, and correspondingly something around 4x the number of users and thus a big increase in the number of users likely to be running nodes. At the same time, because we're talking pretty low hardware requirements still, it would only reduce the percentage of those able to run a full node by a tiny single digit percentage, leading to a huge overall gain in 'decentralization'. Obviously at some point (of further blocksize increasing() the equation would start to go in the other direction, but that's at a _much_ higher blocksize.
"

You're right. Btc has no need for bigger blocks. As a matter of fact, it shouldn't increase blocksize for at least a few years. Nothing would make me more happy!
"There's always one of you. ""What if Bitcoin had a bigger blocksize?"" 

We already know the answer to this. From 2009 to March 2017. When the 1 Mb Blocksize wasn't full, we had fast, reliable, and cheap transactions. 

It was only since around March last year 2017, that bitcoin blocks became full. After that Bitcoin Core became slow, unreliable and expensive."

Just saying ""but lightning"" whilst letting bitcoin become unusable is not adapting to anything.

Bitcoin is decentralized.

legacy bitcoin will still have [segregated witness](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gbfuw/a_massive_collection_of_reasons_why_segregated/) which will hold it back forever, it's just a very bad decision

"If they raize the blocksize they will admit to everybody that they where wrong. Nobody will ever want to work with core developers. Not because they where wrong but because they tried to hijack the project and turn it in to their project. 

So they are completely stuck, they can sit and just hope there won't be a market crash because Bitcoin will not survive that. All other crypto will go down significantly but some will survive if they offer utility. "

"Under a hub and spoke network, yeah it could technically work.

If you connect with many people though, strange things are going to happen. For example, say you want to buy coffee from a shop, and load 10 coffees worth into a channel with said shop.

You also open a channel with your friend Bob, because Bob is new to things.

Carol is also a patron of that coffee shop. And Bob happens to owe Carol for dinner the other day. Luckily, Bob and Carol have a valid path through you and the coffee shop.

So, Bob pays Carol via you paying the coffee shop, and the coffee shop paying Carol.

The next day, you go to buy a coffee from the shop, but find that your channel with the shop does not have enough funds to pay for the coffee... because Bob already spent your channels balance to pay Carol."
sure it might work one day if the decentralizwed rourting problem is *ever* solved, but bitcoin cash and everything else can easily add it then, is it worth waiting 3 years for it?

"Let's look at what Vitalik Butterin has to say about ""decentralised"" 

>“Decentralization” is one of the words that is used in the cryptoeconomics space the most frequently, and is often even viewed as a blockchain’s entire raison d’être, but it is also one of the words that is perhaps defined the most poorly

>Blockchains are politically decentralized (no one controls them) and architecturally decentralized (no infrastructural central point of failure) but they are logically centralized (there is one commonly agreed state and the system behaves like a single computer)



Those are a couple of quotes. You can read the [whole thing here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)"

No he is just being ironic. 
"I remember being pretty excited about bitcoin five months ago. Then I sent my 10$ worth of bitcoin from one wallet to another; I'm still waiting for it to arrive."
It's decentralized!
"Okay, let's see if I understand what's been going on.  
  
A block is a list of transactions. When you make a transaction you peg an additional fee on to it that goes to whoever mines the block with that transaction. By paying a larger fee you're more likely to have your block mined first. As bitcoin's userbase grew there was less block space to go around so fees went up so you're block would be more likely to be mined. If bitcoin increased their blocksize there'd be space for more transactions per block, causing fees to dip.  
  
Am I understanding this correctly? "

I currently have coinbase, most of my money is invested in btc but I don't have a full btc. I'm essentially using it to grow enough that I can pay off some debt (and when I can, invest enough that I can have a decent backup savings!) crypto has been a wild ride trying to understand for me and i would appreciate some help, at least knowing where you guys get correct information from any good sites.

Because BCH supporters care more about seeing bitcoin fail than they do about seeing BCH succeed. 
Lightning network has been explained now and sounds like it should work
"What you did... is epic.

/u/tippr $20"
Difference is BCH has a bigger block size because of community consensus and 6 dev teams. BTC would have it because a single core dev decided to commit the change. We don’t support BCH because of the bigger block size. We support the decentralized development process.

"There are 'insured' wallet options such as Coinbase if the underwriting of traditional bank/government/corporation makes an investor more comfortable.

"At first I thought you were referring to the USB connection.  If your goal is to have an offline, clean, malware-free device, then plugging that into an online computer instantly defeats that purpose.

">I am not sure what is your point... but, indeed, even if bitcoin were to replace national currencies, banks would continue to exist, because their main service -- lending -- would still be as necessary as it is now; and people would entrust their bitcoins to banks

Don't you have to make it so you come up with a seed in a way where you computer is offline and in a special way by splitting the OS or something like that to be secure?
"Satoshi never intended bitcoin to replace banks, credit cards, Western Union, etc.  Check the whitepaper.  Its goal was to make it **possible** for two partes to transact without having to depend on trusted intermediaries.  He never tried to guess how many people would actually need that. 

In fact, I believe that his goal was simply the ego rush of solving a problem that has been open for 25 years, and academics had abandoned because they thought that they had proved that it was impossible to solve.

The goal of bypassing banks entirely was grafted into the project by the cypherpunks, who saw in bitcon what they had been seeking for those 25 years: a monetary system for their utopia, an internet-based society shielded from interference by governments (and therefore that did not use banks at all)."
Didn’t we read a story recently where a guy kept his hardware wallet and seed in a fireproof safe in his parent’s house and they were lost when burglars stole the safe?
"Social Security works exactly as designed, it is a pass-through system. It's a generational transfer, not a savings account. This is by design.

This is because society, at large, cannot save. You can't have ""growth"" by having everyone in society take their money and ""invest"" it. The only way for society to be prepared for the needs of tomorrow is to have infrastructure. The way to have infrastructure is to incentivize its development and maintenance by having demand. The way to have demand is to take money from people who would ""save"" it, and put it in the hands of people who will spend it.

Saving is an illusion for individuals. It only works if not too many people try to do it. Society can't ""save"".

In fact, if a private individual believed people would pay the necessary account fees for a bank that just stores money, and doesn't lend it, one could found a bank like this, and see how many customers are willing to pay the fees it takes to maintain the safety and convenience when the bank isn't earning anything through loans."

Protects the ink against accidental damage.  For security, you should not have any digital copy of your private key.  If something were to spill on your paper wallet or if it were otherwise damaged, the private key might be rendered unreadable, and then you would lose your funds.

"Since all he had to do was press that sweet 'realise' button, and probably why he was on there, why else open a hardware wallet? 

Its gains.

Sure he could have lost them again when the market drops, but he hadn't yet. He lost them a different way.

If you have a winning £50k scratch card in your wallet and someone steals it, you still lost £50k.

You didn't lose £2 just because you haven't taken it to the lotto office and cashed it in yet. You still lost something with £50k value.

What you're saying is... 

You bought £1k of bitcoin and its £1m now - you haven't gained yet. 

You sell the bitcoin for GBP - You haven't gained yet, it's in a bank account, that means it's only insured for £75k.

You take out the £1m in cash - You haven't gained yet, someone could steal that cash, or the value of the cash could change with inflation.

You buy a house with the £1m - You haven't gained yet, the house could burn down, or the housing market could crash.

You die. Leaving an estate of & 1m. - You haven't gained yet, there will be taxes.

Your wife inherits and so no taxes - You haven't gained yet, she might squander it.

She gets kidnapped and £1m is taken. - Oh well you only lost £1k.



What happens if you 'realise' your gains, then put them back into something else. Are they still gains, or are they no longer gains because they're on something else?

If they aren't really gains, then what are the gains on those gains in the new investment? That's some 2nd level non-existence. If I buy a sandwich with the gains on the gains, will I still be hungry because the sandwich never existed? "

"I was thinking more along the lines of the show where they tell you what it's worth and offer to buy it from you. Since currency isn't an auction, if it was worth £25k at the time, that's what you'll get for it. Minus taxes. 

But let's just ignore taxes since everyone knows they exist in most countries and all/most assets attract the tax on sale, so it's still worth £25k.

If someone asks what your salary is, you dont tell them your net take home after taxes, pension and social. You tell them the gross, because everyone knows those things exist.

If you lose your £100k a year job, you lost a £100k a year job, not a £65,779 job. "

The owner is whomever is the owner. Just because a bank employee knows the combination to the vault, does not mean she has a right to take what's inside it.

Never used ledger or other popular hw wallets, but full node wallets generate the wallet files on first boot. Therefore the wallet seeds are also generated at that time. So if you already have a seed, someone else has created that wallet.

"Fraud of what kind exactly?

"Great questions. I think existing precedent in the US would be if you were generating wallets and checking their balance with the intent to take money if they happened to hit on one containing coin, then yes, you are committing a crime. This would be analogous to printing up millions of physical keys and using them to open doors, saying ""hey if I happen to own the key I can take it!""

That said, I don't think this exact incident has come up in US court, but I think it's fairly logical to assume how the judicial branch would treat it if it did. If you're trying to say that person would not be intentionally defrauding people, I think you'll find yourself both in the minority and also in opposition to those interpreting the law. "

Virtually every government  treats cryptocurrency as either property (commodity) or currency. Also, see my edit.
If my experience means anything the cops will find the guy, he'll say he got them from someone else and they'll take him at his word and the investigation will stop there...
This is a good point. I have a ledger and actually have no idea. I'm going to credit the designers with enough capability to ensure that this is not a problem since I a implicitly trusting them with my crypto. However, maybe I/we are being naive. There is also an associated problem, again that I have read nothing about, in that with insufficient entropy, if enough units were sold, the probability of two users generating the same keys would be appreciable, and you could end up with your coins stolen by chance. Does anyone know what this probability is for Ledger? (I doubt it).

Lmao. This dude things cop will care enough to do a this. There’s rape kits yay cops won’t even check and have dna that can put rapists away 
Do you think a Ledger (for example) is much less reliable than an alternative approach? To me, it seems the probability of a hardware weakness (and any single individual ultimately being a victim of it) is pretty low compared with other attacks that can affect *any* system, like falling for scams, having your computer backdoored by a virus, having keys or seeds lost or stolen (physically), perhaps by someone you trusted, etc. I don't have answers to these questions but I would guess, for example, that risk of loss from having a seed back-up physically stolen in some way (however it was generated) is *far* greater than a hardware wallet being compromised. (A slight aside, I could easily imagine a rise in computer theft in future, not for the hardware, but for the possibility of grabbing hardware that contained private keys to crypto wallets.)

"The seller took control of the buyer's property. It is theft.

Edit: Imagine a roommate sells you a new safe, then gives you a ""free"" spare lock to go with it, and you replace the safe lock with the free lock. Then in the middle of the night the roommate goes up to the safe and takes everything in it. It would be unrealistic to argue in court that because the buyer replaced the lock with a lock someone else knew the combination of, that everything put in the safe was equally his. Also, it was so deceptive that that alone could be enough of a case. Deceiving someone in order to acquire money from them is a crime in many cases, if the deception is obvious enough, _even if the person technically did it to themselves._"
That's hopeful then. Could be a way of freezing the accounts or something.
This right here is why I only put as much money on a hardware wallet as I'm willing to lose. It makes it easier to make transactions, but it's riskier because you have more weak links. You have to trust the software on your computer, that the blackbox hardware hasn't been tampered with, and that the device doesn't have any vulnerabilities, accidental or otherwise.
Thankyou for your kind words, it is slowing sinking in, but still really hurts I lost so much.
I have an answer for this. A friend of mine was on a train, and he watched a guy unpack and configure a new Ledger on the train. I kid you not. The guy with the Ledger was in fact so stupid, that my friend was able to take a photo of his seed words and later establish that ~20 BTC was transferred to it. I don't actually know whether my friend stole the money (but he was tempted).
"True. Luckily most wallets are fairly well battle-tested. I am glad I caught it because I'd made several test wallets before I noticed something was up (I was comparing against addresses created using bitaddress.org).

Quite possibly they would actually be the same ""address"" if sent to though. Might be worth investigating."
"thanks, I have just been reading about it, all wallets have pros and cons, even paper wallets have cons

I mean... Chances are you will use some air-gapped machine on top of the pen and paper. Just to be sure.
My house doesn't cost less than $100. You are correct that it would probably be OK but I wouldn't take the chance if it was obvious something wasn't right.
You couldn't even necessarily know if there is a Chinese knock-off that just looks and behaves like a Ledger but has none of those shenanigans.
"This doesn’t seem legit,  you have to chose “Configure as new device”  at the startup,  and create your Pin.   If the device was pre configured , it will ask you for a PIN.  

Did the seller print the PIN for you on the card? 

Can you shed some light on how we’re you able to login  to your wallet ? "
UK
I wouldn't be so sure it was that guy though, maybe the guy was just reselling compromised ledgers and didn't know the source was dodgy?
"When you get a new one, after setting up a pin, it will give you a choice of either initializing (and generating a new seed) or recovering (entering in words to recover wallets).

If you don't get this option immediately, go to the settings and reset/initialize it there."
to confirm, yes you can reinitialize if needed
"here's an offline tool where you can (run it offline obviously) generate the words yourself using coin tosses or dice rolls. 

edit - forgot the link :

You need to sue the seller, AND complain to eBay and PayPal for a refund.
">  at least get the satisfaction of seeing the c*nt put away

On what basis? He sold him a ledger, not a private key. Regardless, can you really say that, legally, there's ownership over a private key with a physical entity? On what basis? What if two people know a private key?

I absolutely this is a scam, but legally? This is a very hard case to make against him."
Yes you could.  The Ledger software that checks the security chip wouldn’t even work.  There’s no way to defeat or fake that. That’s the whole point of Ledger’s Hardware Wallet. Of course if you use knockoff software too all bets are off.  But if you download the software from Ledger’s site, there’s no way to make a knockoff work with it. 
That's indeed very sad and worrying event. We think that hardware wallets can protect our funds, but people are cunning enough to exploit it as well. Between I didn't understood how the seller withdrew ur funds. Don't you need the physical device to actually transfer funds?
Post your BTC, ETH, etc public addresses and I'll donate some money so you can be on the road to recovery
Thanks to you I just checked the nano I ordered was from first party, turns out that it wasn't, even though I could have sworm it was listed on Amazon as such. I returned the item immediately without opening. 
I think your real problem is this was probably done from some pos country. So you may have to deal with authorities in a different country. Potential language barrier. Odds of it being the uk are very low. There’s barely any crypto volume in the eu compared to other continents 
I lost 170 btc to to blockchain.infos shitty wallet in Feb 2017. So I feel your pain. It's about how hard you can get hit and still keep getting back up. 25k might be nothing compared to what you own in 5 years time. Don't get disheartened, just stick to the original plan and make sure you own at least some crypto. 
"I didn’t know this about the ledger... I might well have fallen for the same scam as the OP. 

Thanks for sharing your story OP. You’ve likely saved others from a similar fate. Small consolation, I know, but the community is better for it. "
Yeh it doesn't look great, BUT a lesson learned the hard way may result in much more due diligence in the future, which opens opportunties that he might otherwise have not seen. Also, he may have got scammed later on for a lot more money. £25k is a lot, but it aint crazy money.
This. Others should check their site for other validation information. 
These are the cold hard facts...
"They will give the address. They'll give anyone the address when they buy from him.

Whether that address is real or not is another story. "
yes agreed.  i think it's best to use a combination of a few things:  multiple exchanges - don't keep all your investing stack on any one exchange spread to at least 3 or more.  Then in wallets possibly the same thing but then you have to secure or memorize more seeds....
This needs more votes, so people are aware. 
I really hope so, I know ripple can do that,, but ripple have been of no help to me at all.
Online fraud, fake representation with intent to make a gain for himself or another, to cause loss to another or to expose another to risk of loss.
"I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what it is you've done here.

Someone else generated your seed phrase and private key... and you were surprised you lost your funds? I'm really confused. Why would you ever agree to those terms? You can generate your own keys offline with open source tools. Is there ever some reason not to do that..?

Really sorry for your loss but if I understand this story correctly... my response is ""no shit"". People will never stop scamming you if you don't control you keys. It sounds like at some point, a random ebay seller had physical access to your seed phrase. Is that correct?"

"Very possible.

But you take it one step at a time.

Go after the seller. He will have to go after his seller, and so on and so on until the chain leads to whoever bought from Ledger.

Someone in the chain is the fraudster.

It'll be the one in India, China or Nigeria with no hope of you ever getting it back. "
What if i enter a randome phrase combination  and it loads someone else's key which contains 1000 btc?
There is *never* a pre-printed recovery seed on a scratch-off card. That is never “legit”.  By definition that means someone knows your recovery seed.  No one should ever see your recovery seed.
"$15 to send $1.4

We are talking about a tipping bot"
There's no such thing like property on a blockchain.
Yeh thats fair enough. I guess what I'm trying to say, perhaps not very clearly, is that if you lose a £100k job, you might end up with a £125k job a month later because you didn't realise there were much better opportunities available. I.e. while a loss is a loss, you need to consider the bigger picture, and so things may not be as bad as they seem.
Don't tip him, but do fuck off while you're at it!
I need to keep my ledger the way it is, just in case I need to use it as evidence to find the person that did this.
"A bit like saying

'I worked all month, but the company went bust and haven't paid me... Well, I haven't really lost anything since it's not like they paid me at the start of the month and I have to pay them back'

You buy a vase from a car boot sale in 1963 for £10. In 2018 you find out from the antiques roadshow that it's now worth £150,000. You're so surprised you drop it. 'oh well I only lost £10'.

No. You lost whatever the value was at the time you lost it. You earned it, however easily you might have earned it. You can't go back in time and earn it again. "
"Yes, it does!!! Yes, yes, yes!!

Edit: Forgot you were English, not American. I'm gonna look it up. "
"To put it into perspective, if op could afford 7k buy in, the 94€ cost of getting the ledger off the official site and a month of patiently waiting for it to arrive (while holding on the exchange with 2fa activated) could have saved op from all this heartache .

Don't be cheap or impatient when a lot of money is on the line. Sucks that this world has such ill-intentioned people."
Shit does the UK have a similar deduction for stolen goods?
I might need a little context so I can understand if you are making a point or just providing additional information.  Thank you.
"I wouldn't assume it's impossible until after law enforcement completes an investigation. It's possible the scammer sufficiently covered his/her tracks, but it's also possible mistakes were made.  

In either case, even if a criminal case cannot be made, sufficient evidence or testimony may exist to win a civil case for all the victims (where the standard to win a lawsuit is lower than in a criminal trial)."
"""little to do"" is an understatement. This attack vector can entirely be avoided by avoiding a third party, which introduces another element of trust.

I have seen retards defend this because of the firmware chip, etc. But what if it's just a fake device that pretends to be authentic. It does not even have to function as a wallet.

Don't use third parties..."
At least in the U.S., I don't think establishing theft of crypto-currencies including BTC as a crime will be much of a challenge, since the FBI has already publicly auctioned quite a bit for cash. Moreover, two U.S. federal agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV, have been charged at least partially for stealing bitcoins during their corrupt Silk Road investigations ([article](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/corrupt-silk-road-investigator-re-arrested-trying-to-flee-the-us/)). Seems plenty of precedence already exists.
What the actual fuck. How did that happen?
Thanks so much for your kind words, I am trying to move on but it is hard, I cannot stop thinking about how much I have lost. But I will do everything I can to find the person that did this to me.
170 BTC wow. And i thought i had it bad by losing 9 btc in sports gambling
He got a card with the sealed wallet that had like a scratch off thing to reveal the seed phrase. He thought it was from the parent company and not the scammer. 
Why do you need to wait for Ledger?
Lol. I don't think your local police can arrest a guy in Crimea. 
That stuck out for me too.
Hope the best for you on this bad trip.Good Luck! Thanks for share your history with us.Best regards
That sounds like revenge trading. Not a good idea.
"You are wrong. Lots of fake shit on there unless you are buying from an authorized reseller. The vendor can confirm this.

Amazon is a marketplace. They usually don't actually sell things. They are just offering a platform. I can sell my products on Amazon if I want.

A lot of people just go to AliExpress etc. and stock up in batch and sell fake shit over there. Can be pretty risky with batteries/vaporizers etc.

It can be a pretty big problem actually, depending on what you are buying."
The Ledger box includes such a card, but all rows are empty (you fill them when device generates the words) and there is no a scratch-off region.
How could you prove it was the seller and not the seller's seller?

"Sent you $42 worth of LTC, ~~BTC~~, and ETH as a start. 

Sorry - not gonna send you BTC after all, the transaction fee would have been $21. :("

"Either way. Why would you use a seed phrase that anyone else ever knew? A scratch off ticket seems like hoax security. Obviously it was known in order to be printed. I mean come on. Am I missing something..? A scratch off ticket seed phrase seems like something for children.

Using an exchange (not as storage but for exchange) is one thing. But thinking you own your coins when someone else has your keys is just plain silly."
When I purchased them, they arrived earlier than expected, around a month after I placed my order. Perhaps they are anchoring expectations in case there is a very high demand this next cycle.
"Assume you won't find them and continue with your plan. The pain of abandoning crypto when 1 btc is worth 200k in 10 years will be worse than this pain. Don't double your mistake. You cannot change the past, thinking about it is ""effective as chewing bubble gum to solve an algebra equation"". You were smart enough to invest 8k in crypto so I have all faith you're smart enough to make it again. Someday you will be laughing about what happened the same way I laugh about losing 170btc. This should be your goal. People who get back up after these kind of beatings are the best kind of people. It's worth more than money. 

Are you from the UK? PM me and I can guide you through how you might be able to make money trading bitcoin peer to peer in the UK as a business.  "
"Two separate issues. One was I had two unconfirmed transactions in the mobile app inside my wallet, next time I open my wallet the transactions have dissapeared. Literally disappeared. Ruled out human error as far as is humanly possible. Generated the first 20,000 addresses from the seed incase it was a gap issue. Nothing. Coins are confirmed in the 2 addresses never to be accessible again. 

Second (40btc) was my fault. After the original issue above I generated a new wallet in the app, didn't make a backup of the seed and used a dummy email address. Accidentally gave out an address from that wallet to someone. Deleted the app without thinking, no record of the wallet identifier. Trying to recover these with supports help but I'm not holding my breath. This originally happened beginning of this year. About £170k at the time. Now around £2m without fork coins. I lost 170k though, that's what I keep telling myself anyway. "
"Yeah, but what laws did he broke exactly? ""Theft of digital asset""? Are cryptocurrencies even an asset? Also, the seller sold a ledger and he complied with the sale. Did the sale implied a transfer of a private key? Also, can we really determine, legally that knowing 24 words in a certain order in memory represents ownership? 

As you can see this is very complicated as the very concept of ""ownership"" in decentralized world is very complicated as there's no such thing as ownership in the first place. You do not ""own"" anything. There isn't a tie between a physical entity and a value in a database.

Be real, there are legit companies and exchanges scamming us out of crypto investments and people that had their money disappear facing no consequences.

The buyer should definitely look and talk with a lawyer, but it's not going to be cheap as this stuff requires an extensive amount of research and the chances to win a case are very small imho, but I'm not a lawyer."
"I was admittedly being a dick, which is out of order given the circumstances, but I think a good harm reduction strategy in general is to not invest such a large sum in things you don't understand pretty well. The fact a hardware wallet comes with a pregenerated seed *should* itself set alarm bells ringing.

E: I spel gud"
Yes, not very Cypherpunk but that is what we need. Otherwise crypto will forever remain an interesting project for cypherpunks instead of a new financial system that is better for everybody in the world (that is connected to the internet through some kind of device) then the current one.  There are plenty of cypherpunk's that know this, Satoshi was one of them. Otherwise crypto will stay to cryptic for you and me, wannabe cypherpunk's that are bad with cyphers. (math) 
Even though it is obvious the seller is the scammer, there's no way to prove so. Everybody's innocent until proven otherwise.

I am willing to bet whomever this was is long gone behind a couple Bitcoin mixers. What an awful person.

"This!

The seed is generated automatically when you initialize it. It is shown on the display word for word. You have to write them down yourself!"
In the Leger box there was a legit looking card that stated to use pin 5555 to start the set-up after that it allowed me to set my own pin.
The reason is because I suspected it may not be the seller that did this but the person he purchased the Ledgers from and I was right, he contact me today and explained everything, he is now helping me and will be working with the police to find the person who he purchased the Ledger from.
Thank you so much

The seeds words that are on the card were also pre-installed on my Ledger when I purchased it, when setting up the Ledger it never once ask me to set up the seed words, now I understand it is because someone had already done it.
It was mostly XRP, i got them when they are at $0.26 and had over 5100 xrp.
Why take that risk to save a few bucks??
As I discovered the coins are not stored on the Ledger then are stored on the blockchain, and can only be access with the Ledger, but someone made a copy of my Ledger to withdrawn them all.

How did the seller receive the money? Does the dude have a fake bank account or something?
On one of the cards it say I need to use the pin 5555 first to access the device, then I configured the device as new, but it did not ask me to create any new seed words. The seed words were already pre-loaded into the Ledger.
"Not by name, but things that are a crime: fraud, wire-fraud (how we reckon modern internet fraud), violating the inter-state commerce act (assuming the thief was in the US and in another state), and probably a dozen other random things. The US government (or any other government) don't keep a list of things that ""count"" towards theft. Theft is the taking of another person's property, period. "
The ledger will have info
"And charge him with what exactly?

This is very, very tricky as fundamentally the buyer was using a wallet that did not ""belong"" to him.

Also, the seller can have already converted all the earnings and mixed them up and sent them to multiple unrecoverable monero wallets."
Don't talk to paypal. They won't do dick. Call your credit card company.
I wonder if they will only cover the amount that he paid for the Ledger? Sorry for you OP, if there is anything we can do to help let us know !
You’re trash.
You have no idea what you’re talking about. 
The reason I have not done so, is because I do not think anyone would donate, also there may I hope be a slim chance I might get some of the lost money back.

"i don't want you to do anything. i was giving your an option. but i would throw in everything which comes in to my mind and would strenghen your claims:

- posting the original invoice (you can blackout your presonal informations, like the postal address)
- posting more details, links and photos (package, senders badge) about the issue

Consider creating a simple web site like www.ledger-scam-warning.com, where you describe the scam and a final note, where you ask for tips/donations and some popular crypto addresses (bitcoin, ether, dash, monero).

The cryptospace has some generous people (remember the donations for andreas and the bitcoin sign guy). Maybe you'll lucky and you'll get something back from the community for your warning."
its no your fault is LEDGER WALLET SCAM FAULT , they thing their ledger are in wallstreet ??? its was 59 euro 2month agoans now 99 euro ?? biggest scam ever they taking us for milk cow
Go on eBay and search bitcoin wallet and look at all the sales. It’s incredible. People trying to get involved with this who don’t know. One of the problems with crypto and what keeps it from getting huge so far. 
"Someone who went to the trouble to make that scratch off thing, is not going to get caught. 

The eBay payment shit doesn't matter at all to them.  It was all about the crypto long-game. I wouldn't be surprised if the person selling the item had no idea whatsoever. "
[deleted]
It shows a fundamental lack of understanding with crypto. 
If you loose it all there's no gains to pay taxes on. 
Every mistake takes you one step closer to winning. Be glad this didn’t happen with 1m and get back at it you were doing well and i’m sure you will again! 
Also remember that Amazon blends inventory, so you can order from any seller and get a rigged unit from someone other FBA seller, or a customer return.
Good luck to you man

how do you figure?
Because they have told me they will help in regards to file a police report and I am maybe hoping they can use there IT guys to help track were the money went. I am still waiting to hear from them.
[deleted]
OMG man that sucks. Thanks for telling me this. What do you think, is it safer to put on ledgers or online exchanges.
If the seed words were already generated by the scammer, how did you know the password to login to the ledger???  Password and seeds are both generated during setup.  This should have been a huge red flag when you opened the box.  A new ledger with a password already setup???
How did 7k (or 8k?) grow to 25k over the last 4 weeks? Was it mostly btc and xrp? 
Did the scammer give him the PIN too pre-made along with the 24 words?
"So the problem was not that the hardware was hacked, but they included their seed in the box which they had on another app (i.e. restored a seed you didn't generate)?

That's brutal, I am so sorry to hear that. "
Did you do a reset when you got it?
"The only question I have is why you did not include the sellers name on here? What happened to you was grand theft, and it's a federal offense.. I am worried about the authenticity of this post. If someone on eBay (who was a legit reseller with high feedback.) stole 25,000 ""pounds"" from me I would be on the phone with the police, eBay, and I would flag the seller in your post so people don't make the same mistake as you did. I am worried you may be making this up and could possibly be aligned with a competitor who's simply taking advantage of the latest news that some ebay sellers are selling a ""ledger with unsealed boxes that comes with a scratch off card.""  You claim yours came sealed and all of the other posts on this topic show that the devices came without a seal... please confirm this is a true story and your not just working for Trezor and trying to scare people away from the ledger. Thank you."
"Although it’s hard to look for a positive, you should look at creating a service that helps others from falling into your situation or problem solving when in this situation.

"As someone who has been into crypto for three years, I sure wouldn't have used some printed card, scratch off or not.  But I'm not surprised that someone could fall for this and it took me several months to learn enough when I started to get how seeds and private keys worked.  I lost $5000 to blockchain.info wallet error, because I didn't know how important it is to extra private key.  This is before they had deterministic wallets.

I also lost $25K recently from terrible KMD wallet design.  I claimed the proof of stake interest and it sent my coins to a new address without asking.   Then I reinstalled the program and overwrote wallet.dat file, which I did't even think I needed backed up because I had the private key for that one address.

Anyway crypto is still the Wild West and sorry for your loss."
I don't understand why the recovery card was necessary. I thought maybe they just inserted the card which instructed you to use their recovery seed. But the card doesn't instruct that and you say the device itself was tampered with. So why is the card necessary?
"I'm tipping because I know I would have in fact fallen for this. I hope you recover your money one day.

They disabled showing feedback on their eBay account. I'd be willing to bet before they stole the money and complaints started rolling in.
"I think you are overlooking some factors. E.g. Antiques Roadshow says your vase it worth X, but until you make the sale, it isn't ""worth"" anything, and it will only be worth what someone pays you at the time. And then, you have to deal with the profits - like taxation - which you may not have thought about. Assuming you can sell it for £125,000 to a legit buyer without being scammed or mislead (i.e. less than the Antiques Roadshow optimistic estimate), some way down the road you will be left with some profit (~50%, after tax and fees), at which time you might find that a similar vase sold at auction in the US for twice what you sold yours because the situation was more favorable. So if you smashed the vase by accident, did you lose the profit you might have realised (£62.5k), or did you lose the auction price in the U.S. (£250k)? My point being that until all's said and done, a ""loss"" like the OPs, is, at least in part, perceived."
Was the seller on ebay a reputable seller or the Ledger company themself? 
"That is 34,000 in dollars, not sure why you say it's not

Sorry for your loss that sucks"
I am looking at making a video that will include a lot of those things and will post the video link here in Reddit for all to see. 
If you haven't already, set up a gofundme page to get back in the game...
"> But what if it's just a fake device that pretends to be authentic. It does not even have to function as a wallet.

Then you won't be able to fund it and no coins could be stolen..."
Don't pity and donate cryptos to this person claiming to be the victim. For all we know, the thief of the original story is this same person hoping to scam more of us.

I'm sorry to hear that, whatever you do, do not invest in Dogecoin.
What a weasel! You never ask for a donation, you say. But you solicit everyone because, allegedly, people are commanding you to post a receiving wallet address!?!
That's awful. Sorry to hear. Maybe we can all give a little to help your loss?
Felony Fraud
god seriously... eBay support is nonexistant. They've done nothing  and actually charged me when I got scammed zzzz !
"eBay support blows. I mean, they do what they should / can, but it always takes a long time to connect to some eastern Asian lady whom you need to ask ""Sorry what was that ? "" to every 3 minutes. It'll irk you, that's for sure. "
"Is there a way to check if your ledger wasn't tampered with
"
Unrealized gains are not gains.
Even funner talking to PayPal support. It's like talking to a wall
"Pretty sure it is, even with the status of bitcoin uncertain. 

By parallel, imagine someone getting scammed out of $25000 of voodoo hippy fairy dust. It's the market value that matters, not whether or not it's ""real."""
can we not blatantly downvote comments that are neutral like this one 
I have never ask for donation. I will be keeping everyone updated.
"Just wrote this reply to a similar question [elsewhere in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ojvca/i_am_the_guy_that_lost_25000_due_to_ledger_scam/dsauc5f/) (just my two cents on this):  

> At least in the U.S., I don't think establishing theft of crypto-currencies including BTC as a crime will be much of a challenge, since the FBI has already publicly auctioned quite a bit for cash. Moreover, two U.S. federal agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV, have been charged at least partially for stealing bitcoins during their corrupt Silk Road investigations ([article](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/corrupt-silk-road-investigator-re-arrested-trying-to-flee-the-us/)). Seems plenty of precedence already exists."
paypal is almost as good as CC companies at siding with the buyer. so I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, PayPal and eBay have historically been more conservative in support to favor the buyer, almost to a fault. 
"omg ledger shit
HOW ??????????"
Uhm...... The government and the bank can look into your bank account.......
I mean, apart from them. My neighbor doesn’t know how much I have. 
True,but just because you have a wallet address doesn't mean you know the owner of the wallet. There are some social hacks and IP monitoring to determine who owns the wallet. But no name associated to it. 
Doesn't the ripple market cap ignore the pre mined coins though? It works off the circulating supply
I'd rather the banks go fuck themselves
As long as it gets people their new cars, it's not going to affect them.
There's over 1300 shitcoins listed on coinmarketcap. How am I supposed to know how many of them were similarly allocated? Have you honestly looked at all 1300+? I doubt it. You might not like Ripple, but at least it has a business model, capable of turning a profit. And yes, that includes XRP. The problem with Reddit is that often the opinions expressed here don't make good business or financial sense. Most of the people who are participating in the great crypto frenzy right now aren't motivated by noble sentiments. They're just trying to make money as quickly as possible.
"Haha! Yeaaaaaah of course Ripple is a shitcoin. Keep repeating this to yourself if you want but it won’t make it true. It’s just your silly opinion. Ripple is far from being a shitcoin, it’s one of the few coins out there with real world use case that will be used by major actors, but hey, it’s alright, you’re free to keep your head in the sand if you want!

Not defensive, more like tired of the bullshit you toxic fudsters and trolls regurgitate daily against Ripple. There is so much lies and FUD out there it’s incredible and annoying as hell when you try to stay informed and have to go through all the lies to find some truth. Uninformed people take it for granted and even propagate those lies further. 

It has to stop. Stop the tribalism! You’re part of everything that is wrong in crypto right now. I’m just doing my part to clear some noise. It’s always the same FUD arguments debunked time and time again that comes back, could you at least do some research or be honest enough to stop misleading people? If you are having fun trolling and fudding, I’m having fun bringing back balance and truth to the table. To each their own, I prefer to side by the truth and stay positive instead of keeping myself in lies, toxicity and negativity.

The blockchain technology will be used in a whole lot of other applications than what Bitcoin is after. Get on with it. Stop hating what is different and manipulating others against it just because you can. Grow up. If you want the project you support to succeed just spread the word on how great it is and let the people decide what they prefer. Constructive criticism is always welcome, not lies and baseless FUD. Thanks!

Happy trading!"
I am a big advocate of crypto and I see a lot of coins having a purpose long term. XRP is also one of them. Do your reading past the FUD i.e. as easy as it is, don't just read articles about XRP/Ripple on here. I keep tabs on many subreddits, Twitter streams, forums etc. Get a balanced view rather than regurgitating what your favourite Bitcoin Cash blogger is saying. Don't forget it's in thier interest that thier coins go up at the expense of another. 
Congrats! XLM is very nice and still cheap.
"Yes we all know there is no mining go on for XRP. But it doesn't matter if the founders of a coin mine themselves at low difficulty for 5 months before release, thereby accumulating a vast store, or if they simply assign themselves 100 billion tokens at the outset (like for XRP). The result is the same, developers or founders of a coin, starting with a huge amount of that coin. And that l think is what people often mean by ""premine"". But yeah maybe ""pre-allocated"" would be better, or coin a catchy term if you have one (see the pun there, lol).

A lot of ICOs actually have this kind of feature, especially utility tokens, except that unlike XRP many coins also go to ICO participants, with some reserved for the founders. I think XRP is pretty unique in that it was 100% pre-allocated. Is there any other coin that has that property? 

"
I don’t understand why you’re so fanatical about hating BCH haha or why you’re so desperate to prove something. Don’t define yourself by what you hate, try focusing more on what you love or support. I’m enjoying both BTC and BCH as well as numerous other cryptos.  I just don’t like seeing folks spread blatantly false information. 
"At this point I haven't even been reading what you're saying and just sort of reply when I'm drunk.

I'm enjoying fucking with a bcrash shill and I definitely enjoy shoving the fact the price is tanking in the face of anyone who thinks Ver's scam is worth any salt."
Now we are getting rid of parasite banks
That's awesome!
I've been watching both sides closely but dang if someone tipped me that much!
Nice of u
Thanks for supporting this community with your generosity!
He unlike Charlie has skin in the game. Like all other Bitcoin Cash devs I believe
"Hopefully he's bought into and believes in the work he's doing. 

On the same token, we should all definitely be helping as many active BCH devs as we can. Lest we end up with 1meggreg, paedo toddler, and luke ""bootlicker"" jr again. "
I am pretty sure you can't hire quality devs for that much in these countries. I work for similar amount per month net in Bulgaria and I'd expect people with the skill to develop Bitcoin node to be paid higher than me. And then you add taxes and things that form gross pay and there is no way you hire more than one.
8 hours is nothing for a project like this.
So pay him

He's got a fucking massive ASIC farm. I remember him from a mining sub. Good dude. 
Don't you think it's possible that some of the core developers have been deceived themselves? I mean I see developers making commits for Bitcoin ABC and for Bitcoin Core.  Except for the liars and the toxic people imho if other core developers just admin that they where wrong they can write code for Bitcoin ABC it's all the same to me. If they do a good job I am even willing to fund them with a bit of Bitcoin Cash (if my income keeps growing).  When the core chain dies, who are the core developers going to code for? 
Bitcoin unlimited have funding. I think Peter R has said that BCH pays him enough.
Well you definitely helped fund his work. 
It really depends. You can find some talented individuals and pay them 600-800 $ per month and they will do good work. I was talking about programmers in general and not about blockchain niche. For blockchain Devs I expect the price starts around 1000$ per month.
You are x10 generous than me:P

Well I live in Bulgaria and I have a hard time believing that salaries in Bulgaria are higher than the salaries in Hungary, also the PayScale number for Bulgaria seems about accurate (and is lower than the one for Hungary). $600-$800 seem like something you would pay to junior devs.

Awsome
This guy tips
Anyone know who has the record for biggest tip?  I'd be very curious to see a screenshot if anyone has one
Amazing... and well deserved
I just started using Bitcoin cash the other day, and after researching it, I’ve found this subreddit and why BCH is so much better than BTC. I already have one dollar in BCH! I’ll always stick with you guys throughout my crypto currency journey.
in Bitcoin Cash the community pays the devs after they have done a great job. In Ethereum and other ICO based shitcoins the devs steal the funds beforehand and later just deliver the steaming pile of shit that is barely functional enough to save them from lawsuits and not an inch more.
Can't wait till 2019!
"Right on, the generosity on here is uplifting! 

People talking about that being a day or week rate for a developer - not sure what you're getting at... for your open source developers and whatnot, who use their own time and work on donations, that kind of money goes a long way.

I still don't understand how Tippr works. Does it associate to your Reddit account and do you somehow assign a public key? Dunno."
I’d like to be able to tipp that much lol
I suspect amaury is working on abc client for ideological reasons, he might not even be getting a paycheck at all. Unlike the core devs who are all tech enthusiasts, amaury actually talks in depth about freedom and voluntariyism. He has worked for Facebook in the past, and if he owned enough Bitcoin he probably doesn't have to worry about funding much. 
"Hopefully the devs already have a fair amount of BCH. If they do, it's also in their own best interest to do killer work for the coin. Frankly at some point the idea of even needing a salary to do work that will change the world is secondary (though I'm not opposed to people getting compensation, of course). There are jobs out there I'd do for free, just because of interest in it and because it would be deeply meaningful if I had enough money to live well anyway.

But a fund of some kind to funnel money to development teams who do good work might not be a bad idea."
"Cue “Hey it’s me your bitcoin dev” memes





"
Let's hope Reddit doesn't get hacked again before he gets the money out. Well deserved anyway, and when Bch reaches 10k I promise to tip Amaury too.
"Holy hell dude.
That’s way way generous and awesome.
This is what we exactly need.
Keep up the good work tippers. "
Who the heck has that much plus more probably in their tippr balance?!?!??!??!
i love this
Well it's nice, but it's not going to find a developer for a month.
"The electron-cash development community is also funded by donations. Address: 1GaWKkt3hehRwBSrDmY6uhhKeGp6X8pgGo (from https://electroncash.org/). Good old boring on-chain ;-)"
[deleted]
As great as this is, $2000 is a merely a drop in the bucket for a full time dev. That's payment for a week, maybe, if you're lucky.
"I... I'd like to be tippd that much :c

Anyway, he deserves it."
That just made me feel really poor lol
link to the conversation https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7okvh7/udeadalnix_appreciation_post_since_aug_1_fork_he/dsavye8/
Super cool!
We need to find a way to support the developers though community donations. But tippr isn't secure enough for non-trivial amounts. We have a fully functional blockchain, why don't we use that?
"What are we supposed to do? Just say /u/tippr $218 ???

"
"It's curious that Coinbase's framework values self-funding, that is, coins like DASH or ZCash that have a developer fund being rewarded with each block.

I am of the opinion that a cryptocurrency should not have a self-perpetuating mechanism. Either the cryptocurrency has enough external support or it does not and disappears ""cleanly""."
Can someone explain how this tipping bot works?
/u/asicshack, apparently
My tippr balance is between $1 and $132,107.88 that needs to be given out here still.  
"That's true. From where is u/deadalnix receiving funding for his work? I could 
 contribute some to get him monthly wage. "
"Because he's the lead dev for Bitcoin ABC and that's the client being discussed here.

Check out Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin XT. I don't think deadalnix has any commits to those repos whatsoever."
Weeeeell. Depends on where you live. For 2000$ in Hungary, Romania or Ukraine you can hire 3-6 people full time for one month.
I guess if you only have one developer working halftime on code then you can get away with these kinds of donations but if you want to have a team of full-time developers, you'll have to offer more to keep them from working for big corporations and real money. How many developers work on BTC and how many work on BCH?
"$2000 = 8 hours of a serious pro's time

Amaury definitely justifies $250/hr"

There is absolutely NO reason that the wealth obtained from this ecosystem can not be funneled back into the movers and shakers that want to take the economic development power of the world back from the VCs, governments, and bankers, to create the new world that we all envision, but seldomy acknowledge.
