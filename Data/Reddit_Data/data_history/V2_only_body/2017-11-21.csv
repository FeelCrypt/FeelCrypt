So /u/spez how much longer are you going to ignore the blatant censorship and manipulation r/bitcoin by its mods?
I just tried, lets see how long I last
"I got banned for calling the tether attack a ""fraud"" instead of a hack. "
Can confirm. I'm banned for mentioning Bitcoin Cash
im so glad I was banned from that meme filled sub
Lol, groan

That won't help much with hacked/sold accounts that have been around for a while.
It doesn't matter. I'll collect all what I can and then post it on r/btc. 
"It's suspicious to me that all this documented evidence starts around 11/14. Starting somewhere around 11/10 BCH experienced a gigantic run up and spike in volume, culminating in a price on 11/12 that was ~300% higher than it was just a few days prior. 

I don't know how, exactly, but this vote manipulation has to play into something bigger than just ""an attempt to make it seem like BCH supporters were evil"". 

Tinfoil hat theories - either this vote manipulation started even earlier, somewhere around 11/10, but OP wasn't able to find evidence for that. Or, this was an orchestrated distraction, perhaps a way to place blame on BCH supporters while some group made of with lots of cash after their pump and dump. "
Funny, I was also thinking about the Weinstein disclosures while reading the post.
Well, that is all the more incentive to keep pushing the Gmax-free version of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, so we may bury BTC and that bullshit startup of his alive.
What did he do wrong? Everyone has multiple accounts. Look at the spam in your own sub reddit for multiple accounts of this. I would bet Maxwell doesn't give a shit if you know he has another reddit account. It's not against any rules.
"What if the US goverment could not find Satoshi so they compromised the people they did find, like maybe ... I don't know  ... theymos who you won't find anywhere but on the internet.  I mean it's an age old tactic right: Divide and conquer, divide and rule. 

What was the cliché Gandi quote?

Sure feels like a lot of fighting is going on.

How can we make sure the Reddit admins investigate this? 
It was up when I just checked
"This is obviously all paid for by someone. Not only did someone write a 10-page article, but then there happen to be links from dozens of subreddits?

A little too coordinated if you ask me"
good bot
"In this particular case, the use of hacked reddit accounts is what is criminal.  If they had just created a bunch of fake accounts with fake emails you would be right.  Hacking a person's account is a major federal crime under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act

Before the Community split into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash people tried to get the block sized raised in other ways.  One of these was by making alternative nodes that included the block size increase and then encouraging miners to run and support it.  The first attempt at this was Bitcoin XT, then Bitcoin Classic, and finally Bitcoin Unlimited.  These clients all operated on the legacy chain and if enough people/miners used them would have triggered an upgraded block size.

Core launched a public smear campaign against the alternative implementations and people running the alternative software experienced hacking attacks in the form of DDOS (flooding a server with fake requests from hacked computers until it crashes) and DOS attack via undisclosed exploits (Someone reviewed the code and found bugs that would cause the node to crash then used that to attack nodes and make them crash constantly instead of reporting the issue so it could be fixed)

Both DDOS and Exploit DOS attacks are very illegal under US and other countries laws.  It's hard to pin responsibility for stuff like that on any one person though unless you are law enforcement and have subpoena power.  We were suspicious that it was probably Core/Blockstream but they always brushed it off as conspiracy.  This is direct evidence that they are willing to commit or be complicit in illegal activity."
"Pretty much everything should be archived on archive.is.  You'll have to replace ""np.reddit.com"" with ""www.reddit.com"""
"Hacking online accounts is illegal, misuse of computer system / computer system fraud.  Anyone who lives in the U.S. can sue the ISP who controlled those IP's and force them to identify who and where the money came from, and probably should so the hacker's identity can be confirmed.  The ISP will comply easily, they don't care.

/u/imaginary_username"
Probably on the run 
"So? We've been around this game for years. Reddit is pro rbitcoin. You're going to need a smoking gun so hot it makes ""60 minutes"" if you want to really change the dynamic. Only when reddit.com has to face significant public scrutiny will it act, imo."

"Such behavior is common enough that it even has its own Wikipedia page: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag"
Or at least they appear to have expected it was coming.
And I take it they were doing this in an attempt to rig the market in their favor?
It's not illegal, but it violates the shit out of Reddit use terms and can get the whole sub banned.
Excellent write up. It's hard to Eli5 it.
Thank you! That was very informative. Wouldn’t it make sense though to make /r/bcc the cash subreddit instead of btc, which is bitcoin core on exchanges?
I watched the show on Netflix. Pretty interesting. Specifically -- is such an odd one because it's never taught in school as a proper way to write anything. It's clearly something one acquires and uses subconsciously. I'm not against alt accounts because realistically that's part of reddit appeal but if they are the same it's kind of funny and a cautionary tale
"The ""[evidence](https://imgur.com/9wEcp0a)"" of this in the post shows the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a small list with only a couple dozen active posters, and it shows a half dozen other people using the -- mdash.  It is a fairly common convention.  Unless you're going to start claiming that I'm Peter R now..."

"What I really dont like is the lies, distortions and misrepresentation that BCH is Bitcoin and the takeover of /r/BTC by people with financial motivation to profit in order to artificially prop support for BCH by scamming new users.  They damage the reputation of the entire crypto community and perpetuate the idea BCH is a scamcoin.  

This problem could easily be solved if they migrated BCH talk to a BCH subreddit and cleaned up the topics in BTC to be about BTC.  Instead they purposely continue to misdirect and mislead through obfuscation."
"I'm not sure I understand the metaphor. Is throwing bad trees into the fire a metaphor for killing people?

(Sorry,  not trolling (much). I recognise this is probably a religious quote of some kind - just interested in what it means)"
Why do you think /r/btc exist at all? 
"Part of the reason why ""just creating new subreddit/forum/whatever"" is insatisfactory in many ways is that rbitcoin used to be one of the main rallying points for the community and still today people go there to learn what bitcoin is who will encounter a highly sanitized front and a community where a huge chunk of the members who made what bitcoin is today are outright banned. This has included CEOs of major bitcoin companies as well as CEOS of smaller but important for adoption.  The original developer of Bitcoin right after Satoshi and others like him would post there and now of course don't set foot on that cesspool.

Further note that r/bitcoin is now the base for brigading, not only in reddit but on google store, itunes, etc and that impacts sutff that is discussed at r/btc."
The problem is new users are misled in r/bitcoin. A private company has taken control and is lying to unsuspecting visitors for profit. 
Nobody brought up the coin at all. This is an obvious false flag attack with criminal activity you fucking sock puppet.
"> Who has this much time and money to spin up such a consipiracy? 

People like you who are scared of losing money and so they spend their time trying to attack the other side."

Segwit coin wouldn't exist without the ""worse idea"".

Evidence matters very little to you doesn't it?
so your comment doesnt downvoted by bots :)
"**Theory**: the r/Bitcoin mods are feeling heat from the reddit admins because of the massive number of removals, censorship, bad PR, the stolen donations, etc.  Or they are anticipating such pressure in the future, as I know users here complain and the OP is compiling a very compelling database of data (in addition to the very clear and sourced Blocke articles).


They told the admins it was a necessity because of vote manipulation.  This is their way of proving that while scoring some brownie points for their users.


Your thoughts, /u/spez and /u/sodypop?  I'm a 10+ year redditor, I've talked to both you and kn0thing in person once, I was one of the first subscribers to Gold back when it was a pure donation and I donated quite a bit, etc.  I started and managed a community that evolved into a top 20 subreddit, which I modded for years (so I know the game, the tools, etc.).  I am not OK with what is going on in r/Bitcoin, and I am unable to comment there for my political views.  I have been accused of socking, botting, trolling, doxxing, etc. by those mods and I promise you I did none of the above.


In an age of media manipulation I find the services OP is providing invaluable.  To OP: I would support open sourcing all this data in full and allowing researchers to have at it.


Let's not forget, by the way, that only one of these subreddits has public mod logs.  That speaks *volumes*."

"Oh I was not at all questioning your methodology. It is pretty common practice for establishing authorship in other fields by examining repetetive grammatical constructions and vocabulary usage. I had a graduate course in Shakespeare that delved into authorship through these type of studies.

/r/bitcoin is a subreddit which supports bitcoin CORE which has the ticker symbol BTC on exchanges. /r/btc is a subreddit which supports bitcoin CASH (a fork off of bitcoin core) which goes by BCH on exchanges. 
"rBitcoin became a heavily censored sub and banned nearly half the community. They allied themselves with a private corporation called Blockstream which usurped development in 2013-2014. Until that point most of the community wanted to upgrade the network with bigger blocks. Blockstream didn't want that though since their business model requires smaller blocks to force people to use their product from which they collect fees.

rBTC became the free speech reddit. "
I agree. If Reddit doesn't take internal action then the next step is to alert external authorities. Reddit may be complicit as well.
lol, is this a Chinese proverb or of your own creation?
Because they have become a cancerous tumour not just in the bitcoin sphere but to cryptocurrencies in general.   In r\bitcoin the banks now have a foothold on crypto.
This sub is created only cos r/bitcoin became a propaganda machine
"r/btc talks about BITCOIN

Bitcoin Cash is the descendant of Bitcoin - the closest version of the original.

BTC is another descendant of Bitcoin - the brother to BCH.

Both are Bitcoin.

If a sub was about General Electric stock & the stock had a split to A shares and B shares, the sub would talk about A & B shares.

However, r/bitcoin deletes all discussion not only of BCH, but it also deletes discussion of Bitcoin that is outside of the ""approved speech.""  Massive censorship over there.

At r/btc you can talk about BCH, BTC, Bitcoin Gold, or any other Bitcoin discussion you want."
Keep commenting and upvoting.
Gotta educate the newcomers 
"If you bought Bitcoin because you believed in freeing yourself from banker control then sell your btc for bch immediately.

Btc is just bitcoin by name and first move advantage. It has been subverted by bankers to keep their system going, not the true spirit of Bitcoin.

Imagine if there was a way to cryptographically prove your identity using a distributed database scattered across a peer-to-peer network!
"For years the Bitcoin developers were debating how to scale Bitcoin. One group of devs, the originals who the inventor of Bitcoin passed development onto when he left, wanted to increase the blocksize as was long the plan. Most of the community agree with this since it was the plan from the start. 

But a second group of devs who had worked their way into development were insisting... on doing nothing. Not scaling. No improving the network so more people could use it. Instead they wanted to transform Bitcoin into a settlement network and make it more like banking 2.0... rather than the P2P cash system it already was. When the original top dog dev Gaven Andresen stepped down from his power position... these new devs swept in and quickly filled the power vacuum, created a company called Blockstream, and usurped Bitcoin development. Within a year or so in August 2015 Theymos the mod of rbitcoin decided to ally with these new devs and censor anyone who disagreed with them instead of allowing for open debate. The community was immediately fragmented and divided.  "
This is premature. /u/nullc is such a revered figure by Core fanboys that it would hardly be a surprise to find someone following him around and aping his arguments and writing style. 
Exactly
No, needs mods changed.
LOL You thought the Central Bankers who control a $100 trillion dollar business are going to sit back while a bunch of crypto nerds horn in on their business?  and do it for free?
You can pay in btc

No, that's what all **bankers** do to every national currency.
Greg Maxwell is fucked.
r/bitcoin mods and a C level executive at Blockstream hacked a bunch of reddit accounts and manipulated vote counts on their own r/bitcoin forum before posting that r/btc was to blame for it.  The account hacking bit is very against the law and could go to jail for hacking.
Alas I am banned (along with half of Reddit I imagine.)
Criminals sticking up for the banking cartel, it's nothing new, just sad to see what the bitcoin name has been tarnished by.
(the same goes for trying to discredit the other side using the same means.) Also - great work by the researchers.

We have also seen many of the default subs bought out by political interest groups like ShareBlue and the result is that an impartial opinion on /r/politics, /r/news or /r/worldnews is now non-existent, they are all just echo-chambers. 

  We have mods that moderate hundreds or thousands of subs. We see people being banned from subreddits they have never visited just because of their participation in another sub. We see mods abuse power to ban users from multiple subreddits for one infraction, or with no infractions in some cases. Often these bans come with no explanation and questioning them leads to simply being muted (why does this option exist?). We see a multitude of censored comments in any thread about a remotely sensitive topic.  

  It is clear that the administrators are happy to let these abuses of power persist and happy to let the site become a hyper-politicised safe-zone for liberals. We've seen the site's algorithms changed to target one specific sub which doesn't go along with the narrative, /r/The_Donald, hiding posts from that sub from the front page even though they were happy to let /r/SandersForPresident take over the front page during the 2016 primaries. We also saw an astonishing action taken by the CEO of reddit, Steve Huffman, where /r/The_Donald's users' comments were personally shadow-edited by Steve himself in an act of petty retaliation for the criticism he received, which says a lot about the type of character he is.  

  Finally, the direction the site has been taking lately is very discouraging, as they aim to become a new Facebook. We are now seeing Facebook-like user profiles and a Facebook-like card-view homepage to go along with the Facebook-like quality of content that reddit has sank to, and it looks like the mission to turn reddit into another social media site is well underway, making this a great time to leave.  

  As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this annoying message. I've had some gilded comments, made some funny jokes, given some good advice and started pointless arguments, but now they will all be turned into this, as I delete my profile and take back every comment.  

   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari, [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera, or [AdGuard](http://adguard.com/) for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this Monkey script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10905-reddit-overwrite-extended).  

 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.!

"I believe everything to be true as if you look at all the links and evidence it all backs up every claim made. Evidence is evidence. Whether people choose to willfully ignore it is on them, unfortunately. There are still plenty of people that will be brain washed coming from /r/bitcoin, BitcoinTalk, etc. 

Why this was done has become blatantly obvious. The mods of /r/bitcoin are clearly working with Blockstream employees/Core Devs to manipulate the market in their favor. We've seen this time and time again now for at least two years; but now there is evidence and facts to prove it and back it up. How Blockstream/Bitcoin Core devs were able to get /r/bitcoin mods in their back pocket, isn't yet known, but seems also painfully obvious being that Greg Maxwell and theymos have a long standing relationship going back to BitcoinTalk, Greg being a paid staffer there, theymos working with Warren Togami (Blockstream exec) on the Slickage forum embezzlement, and more. The rabbit hole goes very far down and this only scratches the surface. But for the first time we have actual proof that is undeniable that the two groups actively work together to manipulate the market.

I'm also highly skeptical of the tether scam happening right now and what role that plays with Bitfinex and Blockstream. That is still developing, but more news I'm sure will come of that in due time. "

It says that Blockstream and r/bitcoin admins hacked r/bitcoin users accounts and then used them to give the false perception that enemies of r/bitcoin were doing it.  In particular the CTO of Blockstream and Core Dev Greg Maxwell is implicated in criminal hacking activity.
People's magic, flawless internet money is being toyed with or sth.

"Surprise, no, but it is the first time there is strong evidence linking him to being at minimum complicit in criminal hacking activity if not the hacker of the reddit accounts himself.

If you think about the implications can anyone trust any software Blockstream puts out after these revelations so long as Greg is in the C suite at Blockstream?"
More like report it to the FBI.  They investigate stuff like this.  I'm sure they would love to take down a corrupt company in the Bitcoin space.  Maybe they can Seize Greg's Litecoin and auction it off too.

It's very relevant.  /r/btc is being controlled by moderators with financial interests in an alt coin.  Even in the OP they show that /r/btc was astroturfed with bots to support BCH, except they blame it on people from /r/bitcoin despite the fact the lead moderator (Ver) is using it as a marketing channel for BCH.
Yeah, I know they are bad. I just don't want to burn them to death. (Even if they really are witches :-)
Agree if it were just a random reddit account hacking they wouldn't care.  This involves a major company in the Bitcoin Space though.  If they dig in they will find some sleezy stuff.  The Reddit account hacking is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is bad enough to warrant some initial probing. I doubt it would take long before a whole bunch of other terrible shit would be revealed to them because Greg and his minions are sloppy dumbasses.

Well in this case, the content is talking to yourself in an effort to make your point seem more legitimate and appearing to be in cahoots with a hacking plot to disrupt and misinform.

are you everyone?
for the last fucking time: yes, hacking accounts is illegal.
How so? Do others not do this same thing? One would easily assume yes. Plus it's not against Reddit rules to open multiple accounts.
Well, my node never actually went down despite the DDOS... So even that part was bullshit. =)

tl;dr most /r/bitcoin readers are noobs and technical discussion is far more prevalent on /r/btc"
"Well I'm not aware of anything like this but it is either a service where you provide a subreddit and the hackers comes back to you with a list of hacked account

OR since u/nullc is very skilled could have pulled it himself indeed. Actually any skilled dev could have done this

- Get the list of all r/bitcoin and r/btc (super easy)

- run a dictionary attack on them (super easy) to get all the accounts using shitty password of type 1234,1111 and all the other common easy one

Both of these subreddit have 100'000+ users so it is statistically easy to find enough accounts with crappy passwords this way.

But any way, both are illegal and whoever did it will face jail time 

u/nullc is probably shitting is cyber punk pants as we speak"
Honestly you can accuse people of shilling, fake accounts, bad intentions, lying etc but hacking really is on a different level

Oooo, buying known stolen property.  Also a crime.  I'm skeptical though because how else do you account for such a high percentage of the hacked accounts being r/bitcoin users?  They must have told the hacker they wanted users who frequent r/bitcoin or done it themselves.
Had. The issues have since been fixed but yes, they found a way to send certain data that would cause the node to crash and as soon as the operator would restart it they would just attack it again.  eventually people found the problem they were exploiting and fixed it stopping the attack. 
Yeah it's a stretch to suggest actual links to illegal activities. I wouldn't be surprised given everything that's happening right now and the subjects they censor, but the link is weak... so far.
Yes. So? They've been doing this for years. What makes you think they'll stop now unless there is a much more significant public outcry?
If they're choosing sides for such an egregious act we should seriously question why we're here. There's other options, especially within the cryptocurrency community.

"I think that the small blockers are feeling increasingly desperate and are running out of tricks to win the currency competition, so they're trying desperate tricks such as false flags even though they know that the negative effects of getting discovered are high. They fear a potential cashening (also called ""flippening"") event because they instinctively know that LN with routing for millions of users is a technology that's not going to be invented, implemented and adopted for many years.

The small blockers know that if they don't use immoral tricks then the Bitcoin users and speculators will choose the Bitcoin version that already has scaling solved directly on-chain and today: Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Segwit is intentionally retarded to only 6 transactions per second so it's not really a competition even. It's like running a marathon when your main competitor has chosen to (voluntarily and for no good reason) only use one leg."
I am a total noob who wandered into here from /r/all. All I do is follow the price of BTC. Isn't this sub and r/bitcoin using the same currency?
"That's still too side v. side for me. There are people with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line here. All that's happening is pumps and dumps and distractions so that everyone else is worried about /r/bitcoin vs. /r/btc. 

A large amount of the mining network switch over because of the broken difficulty adjustment algorithm in BCH. For those few days, BCH was something like 3x more profitable to mine. Also during that time, we saw the largest trading volumes of all time, with suspicious spikes where BCH was trading at 2x volume over all other coins on just a few exchanges. After the difficulty adjusted again, trading volume fell, and BCH/BTC price has been falling pretty consistently (albeit, slowly).

Look, what I'm saying is that people making these markets move and buying mods don't care about subreddit debates, and honestly, probably don't really care about tech discussions. There are fortunes being made while we bikeshed who is on the right side of the blocksize increase. 

That's my tinfoil hat theory, but think about it - would you put this kind of market manipulation and propaganda past the CEO's and billionaires that play in the conventional stock market?

"I've been very coherent and rational.  I even outlined a very simple solution.  The sub is out of control and off topic and has been for awhile and the moderators have no interest in cleaning it up.  I've made a top level thread before to express that very thought, that they should clean up the discussions to be about btc and make a bch subreddit and got buried in downvotes by the cultists of /r/btc.

There is direct evidence the shilling for BCH in /r/btc is the product of the moderators of /r/btc themselves who have actual motive to push BCH where /r/bitcoin has none whatsoever.  It's not a false flag attack, it's an astroturfing operation to build support for BCH.  Go look at the volume of posts shilling for BCH in /r/btc.  The entire subreddit is dedicated to BCH despite being named /r/btc.  They push BCH products and services.  They perpetuate lies that BCH is the real bitcoin.  The user base actively trashes BTC.  That's not some conspiracy of users from /r/bitcoin doing that, thats the users and moderators of /r/btc.

I dont see /r/bitcoin trying to move products and services in such brazen ways.  Their moderators dont push their own companies and services.  This entire post is a bunch of lies and misdirection like every other topic in /r/btc.  Go troll the subreddit.  90% of the stories on the first page will be about BCH.

"**False flag**

The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.

Lance deHaven-Smith states that ""The term “false flag” originally referred to pirate ships that flew flags of the home countries of the ships they were approaching to attack and board. The pirates used the false flag as a disguise to prevent their victims from fleeing or preparing for battle. The term today extends beyond naval encounters to include countries that organize attacks on themselves and make the attacks appear to be by enemy nations or terrorists, thus giving the nation that was supposedly attacked a pretext for domestic repression and foreign military aggression.""

Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation.

Some other fun facts about Bitfinex - 

* They are an investor in Blockstream
* Their CEO admitted to wash trading and insider trading 
* They were hacked last year for $72 million and hacker has never been caught 
* Adam Back and Greg Maxwell have a special relationship with them. After the hack last year they were caught in a scandal to not release payment for identifying hacker
* Bitfinex used Bitgo to auto approve all txs in their massive hack (Bitgo also heavily aligned with Blockstream) 
* Bitfinex is a partner for upcoming Blockstream Liquid sidechain 
* Bitfinex works closely with Blockstream to undermine Bitcoin Cash calling it “bcash” 
* Bitfinex also is owner of Tether (shell company)
* Bitfinex issued new tethers to pump SegWitCoin 
* Tether “hacked” to cover losses on Bitfinex "

Why does it say excellent match then? 
It's actually the opposite.  If one user controls two accounts, it's unlikely they'll post within *a few seconds* of each other. However, just by random chance, we'd expect two separately-controlled accounts to post within a few seconds of each other. (The exact expected minimum gap is shown.) So, if the gap is **much higher** than the expected gap, it's more likely that they're controlled by the same user.

"As a reader of /r/bitcoin (and this sub too obvs) this is a concerning accusation. But it seems there is still no actual proof here of wrong doing.

This is not the case. I've been reading on the sub since a year or two and the vote counts have always been visible to me. I think there is a period of ~~1h~~ 12h after posting where they are not visible, but after that period everyone can see them"
No idea what this wall of text says and I don't care.
I think this detective work is pretty awesome. Is this just bad for the rBitcoin sub or is it also bad for Bitcoin? I see that the r/btc folks would like to have BCH replace BTC.

The sloppiness doesn't surprise me.

You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do. So yeah, expect this problem to become exponentially worse."

They essentially drained as much wealth as they could from people who were unprepared for the impending price swings they knew they were about to cause. They drained the people who panic-sold and panic-bought at the worst possible times. It's fucking criminal, really. Insider trading, basically.

"Regardless of whether you support Bitcoin (legacy/core) or Bitcoin Cash, if you engage in hacking, bot voting/posting, opportunistic propaganda, you are harming your project. Just don't do it. 

One of the hallmarks of the bitcoin debate on twitter has been fake accounts liking posts (30-50 likes really suddenly by people with accounts that only have 50 or so followers, and just look a bit too obviously trying to be 'normal'), trolling people, and amplifying messages (propaganda). My suspicion is that the same people who engage in this crow about having 'the community' on their side - in other words they have no ethics or credibility and are just toxic people incapable of self reflection. Just don't do this, even if you see the other side doing it. "

"This thread looks bad. Not for u/nullc but more for r/btc. There simply isn't enough evidence to say that u/nullc is u/4n4n4. It's possible but there is NOT enough evidence. 

The reasoning behind removing the votes displayed limit by the r/Bitcoin moderator make sense. They don't prove anything.

It is possible that is was all a r/bitcoin conspiracy but it is equally possible that it was someone from r/btc who did that. There is nothing in this posts that provides much evidence for either things.

The upvotes and the number of times this post has been gilded makes me suspicious that most people here are merely wishing for it to be a r/bitcoin conspiracy, whether there be any evidence for it or not.

If anyone can dig deeper and prove anything about what happened with the account hacks, that would be welcome but I am afraid this post does not provide enough evidence for anything.

This thread is almost as unproductive as the several vote brigading threads yesterday on r/Bitcoin front page. Let's not get distracted over petty squabbles and focus on more productive conversation. :)"
How anyone can back BTC that does stuff like this is beyond me.  It goes against the entire spirit of cryptocurrency and what we hope to achieve with it.  This is why we support BCH.  We aren't trying to support some altcoin, we just want Bitcoin to be what it used to be, a way to change the world for the better.

There's only one thread to read through.  Before compiling your evidence, just read the one thread all the way through to make sure you didn't miss anything.

My guess on the whole ""attack"" was that it was a poorly programmed bot going wild.  Likely the bot was programmed to downvote comments 20 times an hour and the programmer missed a decimal place on a timer and it went wild with 200 votes a second.

"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

"
"If I remember correctly Gregory Maxwell often refers to the ""Bitcoin Core project"" as ""the Bitcoin project"" which is quite unusual. Here's /u/4n4n4 also referring to the Bitcoin Core project as ""the Bitcoin project"" just as if there are no other (competing) node client projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited existing:

http://archive.is/2qfrJ#selection-2021.0-2021.55

It sure sounds like they're the same person. If it turns out that they are the same person then I feel a little embarrassed on Gregory's behalf because it's quite sad to invent a whole other person or (political) [wingman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingman_\(social\)) like that."

By doing this they have flat out broken the policy of the site... Other subreddits have been banned because of this.
I'm not surprised either, just really pissed off at this point.
Paging u/adam3us, what do you feel about a C-level executive in your company that might be involved in criminal activity that goes against the ethos of the community which you and all other companies within the Bitcoin sphere relies on? Personally, I find this kind of behavior disgraceful and completely unacceptable, and would take above accusation very seriously. If we as a community want to persevere and replace the legacy banking system, we cannot be seen as a bunch of authistic hackers. It is just bad branding.
Probably on the run

Welcome home.
"/u/spez I once shied away from replying to you reddit admins when you asked me (u/PsyRev) what I meant by r/bitcoin being run badly by Theymos and doing bad things to ruin bitcoin. I didn't feel I had enough to give and I was leaving reddit (deleted my account as you see) at the time, so I figured you'd hear my plea and see for yourself in time.

Here we are now and I hope you're watching or that you'll be watching what's happening. This thread is a good indication of at least part of what's going on, so I'll leave it at that."

It might be worth mentioning the tool's overall takeaway on this one: **Unlikely Sockpuppet**
"To be fair, the conclusion is ""unlikely sockpuppet"" based on the post timings. (I wrote this script.)

It's meant to be more specific than sensitive. That is, I tried to reduce false-positives as much as possible. "

Can you expound on the criminality you're referencing?  I'm not casting doubt, but reddit vote manipulation isn't illegal, so I'm interested in what else they've done that we should know about. 
The most telling aspect of this is the solid link of \/u\/nullc (Greg Maxwell of Blockstream) to the \/r\/bitcoin mods. It proves (again) they have been working together to manipulate both subs.

If this doesn't get Reddit admin's attention I don't think anything will. But that doesn't matter as much. Why do people in Bitcoin allow this shit to carry on? This is BLACK AND WHITE PROOF of rBitcoin mods and Blockstream forming a cartel to take over Bitcoin. WTF!

People telling interested users to use wire transfers or a crypto that actually works for transfer of value instead? What the hell even is that that's not even misinformed that's flat out wrong.

Also, if you have a longstanding open channel and don't check it for say two weeks, then it is possible for someone to just steal all the money in the channel, or at least leave you with the lowest balance you had in the channel.

So what? So did I, and I still like it there.  That's mostly because I agree with the technical aspects of Bitcoin, and you prefer the technical aspects of Bitcoin Cash.

Did I say anything inaccurate? You *don't* like it there, but that's fine, you've got this sub now.

I visit both subs for an overall view of different viewpoints.  Both subs have stupid posts at times, and both sometimes raise good discussion points, but this victim mentality that surrounds these 'censorship' and ""Get the Reddit admins!!"" posts is quite sad."
"Here is just one example: https://r.go1dfish.me/r/btc/comments/7ec213/trezor_email_claim_tool_for_bitcoin_gold/

"What have they done that's not ethical?  Promote the fork that they believe is Bitcoin?  This is how Bitcoin works - there's nothing unethical about it.

And this isn't about defending BCH or Roger Ver - it's about calling out the blatant censorship, manipulation, and centralized authority over Bitcoin discussion."
How am I spreading FUD? He WAS a digital hero. And he would be ashamed to see the state this website is in today.

Nope.
well then calling the other one r\bitcoin is an even bigger piece of misinformation 
I wish that were the case, it's been 2 years since I last posted there and to be honest I don't get why people go there. However, there was a false flag attack right here on this sub and /r/bitcoincash just a week ago. Also given that the same people are likely behind many attacks on other media, it is quite a challenge to ignore.
newcomers go thre, get misinformed, then shout out lies thinking they are facts
Except new users find their way there and have no idea they are being lied to for profit. Shame on Blockstream and their investors for running a shady unethical business. 
"I created this account for r/bitcoin over 3 years back, how dare you shove this condescending ""Look - you guys at /r/btc don't like /r/bitcoin, that's fine"" in your lame belittling attempt!  "
"I just had a look through the mod logs myself. I see obvious spam being removed and it looks like there is a user blacklist for (presumably) repeat offenders. I don't see anything that looks like it was removed specifically because it was about Bitcoin Gold or Roger Ver.

Nice try though."

its lame to call your sub r/btc why it should be named r/bch

Not sure why people downvote this
I'm confused. I'm not chasing you into other subreddits and calling friends to downvote you, if that's what you implied?
"That's fair enough. But the propaganda campaigns go both ways.

I guess I'm just seeing /r/bitcoin as a *subreddit*, that doesn't really impact things in the outside world. Yes, there is moderation of posts to follow the subreddit's rules, maybe some of that moderation verges on 'censorship'.  

Personally, I've never been censored or banned (in any of my other/main accounts), and I've raised various technical discussions over the past months and years.  Either way - comments and upvotes hardly matter in the grand scheme of things...programmers and money get things done.

"
"> What is in this post is the reason bitcoin is branched in two now.

No, it's not. This post is moaning about /r/bitcoin brigading a phone app, and rambles on about how they don't like the way a subreddit is moderated.

>  it's team A versus Team B and one is a victim

^ Is exactly the attitude of the majority on this subreddit. 
"
Read the comments. BitcoinXio commented in each citing the side bar rules (e.g. scams) as reason for removal. Also, my other post now has 5 different BTG threads that were removed, and there are more I havent linked. All those users were blacklisted? And if so, isn't a blacklist with without defined parameters for addition a form of censorship?
[deleted]
Kind of new here... at what point did /r/btc become mostly in favor of Bitcoin Cash? I realize a lot of /r/bitcoin exiles ended up here but the rest I am unsure of. 
"Still don't see any explanation about their unethical practices or ""corrupt initiatives"" now.  Just because you're on the opposing side and don't like them, doesn't make them corrupt or unethical.

And even if true and you actually believe that, what's your point in the end?  Does one person discredit all of Bitcoin Cash?



"
r/ btc has been a place where 'big blockers' (from the scaling debate) could come to discuss their side of the issue after being censored and, in many cases, banned for opposing the small block approach that is sanctioned by those who control r/bitcoin. This occurred long before the fork of bitcoin which created BCH - which is bitcoin with the larger blocks and low transaction fees that were always envisioned since the days of Satoshi.
Gradually over time since the Aug 1 fork
"As far as I remember bitcoin cash has always been generally supported here. It's fairly new though. Up until that it was a lot of calls for direct increases in block size to between 2 and 8mb.

I also see a lot of people here who say that segwit and sidechains are good ideas, they just think that those tings need to be a part of the solution, not the entire thing. Especially not when they're at least 18 months out and untested."
[deleted]
I do. What are the unethical practices or corrupt initiatives of which you speak?
"Oh that is gold.  You can't give any examples (because they're not true) so instead you claim I don't want to see them.  

Roger has made more money than anyone could ever need with Bitcoin.  If he was in it for the money, why would he spend his time, energy, and money supporting this opposition that is dividing Bitcoin and causing it to lose market share, rather than just sitting back and watching BTC soar?

Anyway, I've said enough and I'm tired of humoring another core troll now."
[deleted]
"It's a decent attempt, and the most successful in current operation.

But I'm not convinced directly rewarding posters for successful content leads to good content in a link aggregator/social network.

The UI also feels pretty clunky and slow to me.  But alternate frontends are quite possible.  Maybe I should build one.

I tried it out for a while, it just felt pretty meh, it seems like everyone cares more about getting paid than discussion."
You have yet to provide an iota of evidence for your outlandish assertions.
Lol, this sub was created before bitcoin cash was a thing dummy.
it's lamer r\bitcoin gets to keep that name when they are no longer remotely related to bitcoin outside a narrow and controled view
"Downvotes = deletion of non-favored opinions

Downvotes = silent hiding of comments that look normal to posters

Downvotes = permabans of longtime community members for being even mildly critical of censorship

Got it."
Can you give examples? 
"I think in that limited scope I forgot this all-time favorite of rbitcoin mods:

"Yep.  Back when /r/reddit.com was still around.

https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/l30f9/blatant_censorship_has_been_going_on_in_rpolitics/ hit the top of /r/all and then they closed down /r/reddit.com less than 2 weeks later."

"Just as some of us prefer BTC and some BCH some of us are concerned about the censorship and propaganda campaigns being waged against bitcoiners and some of us -apparently - are not.

It’s important to a lot of us. Characterizing our indignation as a victim mentality is highly disrespectful. 

Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. "
"Well, you strawman me, I strawman you: you sound like one of those idiots with the most binary possible view of the World and assumes that binning everything in 2 is ""saying how it is"".

Everything you said was wrong.

I'm not a fan of coffees on the blockchain forever and think that layer 2 and fee markets will be critical (they might come about by miner enforced limitations but that is another thing). I also think that regular blocksize increases are important and are one of the ""technical aspects"" that should be **discussed**.

Further, I don't go to subs to hear my own voice back, I don't go to reddit for the echo chamber. A lot of people don't go to places to ""like it there"" you thick 1 bit drone! So I'm not there because I ""don't like it there"".  I don't go to bitcoin because I got permabanned for demonstrating the pathetic silent hiding of comments when it was being denied**. 

What is in this post is the reason bitcoin is branched in two now. Have you looked at the size of each branch? Are you able to install a few extra bits beyond ""oh it's team A versus Team B and one is a  victim"" to comprehend the scale of the consequences of what the people who control the place that you ""still like"" had on bitcoin? Does it register that it is important? Does it register that maybe moderates could be in control and bitcoin still be one? 
"
"Those links conveniently omit the reason for the removal, which you can see if you look at the mod logs yourself. The Bitcoin Gold post was removed because the user posting appears to be on a blacklist. _Not_ because it's Bitcoin Gold content.

I don't know how many users are on the blacklist or what it takes to get added or removed. I'd be interested in knowing that actually.

But your claim is specious."
Can you give any actual examples? Or will you just gish gallop like you've already done?
"Still waiting for an explanation on what they've done that's unethical and I'd love to see evidence of their bots and paid shills.  

And it's funny you bring up Ver's conviction, which is completely unrelated to Bitcoin and used as a character assassination by core supporters, and then cry dirty games.  Especially after substantial evidence was just released that /r/bitcoin mods are the ones behind the vote botting which you're desperately trying to deflect from.

"When this whole house comes crashing down, reddit is going to be the co-defendant on the hook for hundreds of billions of losses a direct result of their lack of monitoring and toleration of rule breaking.

Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1357/

This is why the admins don't get involved, and thus is why the reddit admins allow ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" posts here when people over _there_ don't like it or agree. 

You have your safe place to talk, and so do they, you do not get to impose your will on them, and you are protected from their will being imposed on you. 

The CSS on this site isn't brilliant either, if you're reporting bad CSS can you also report the fake pseudo advert for the bitcoin.com mining pool."

Edit: while I appreciate the downvotes, an actual reply would be even better...

Edit 2: looking through the mod log for just today, multiple Bitcoin Gold and negative posts about Roger Ver have been removed by the mods.

Edit 3: still waiting on those responses. Bunch of downvotes, but only 1 response, which I refuted, yet it is still up voted... It's like you guys don't even care about censorship, just pushing your narrative...."

Sometimes I wonder whether people actually care about crypto or care more about some hyped up 'war'. Don't people have other things to care about?"
This is getting beyond pathetic. This sub is so fucking salty. Both subs are echo chambers for their respective users but look all the posts on the front page here. All are about core. r/bitcoin  may be a bunch of memes and ATH posts but there’s discussion as well and they aren’t obsessed with BCH as you guys are with BTC. Winners focus on winning losers focus on losers. 
This isn't news. The admins here are filthy corrupt ideologically bigoted pigs as much as theymos. Just try mentioning anything that tv news wouldn't talk about... ALL of the major subreddits are in the same boat. The voat.co people were right.

This was sorely needed, thank you. u/tippr 0.025 BCH
there was a censorship incident or two i remember around the CEO Ellen's time
"I've been on reddit nearly 10 years now (second account) and without fail Reddit admins have supported corporate interests and this seems no different to me.

I remember the first big one I ever heard of was the Sears debacle. Someone realized that you could alter the URL on Sears' website to make the product title say anything. AS you can imagine there were a ton of joke posts of buying ""Hitler's Socks"" and whatnot from Sears.

Within hours Conde Nast had sent a strongly worded letter to reddit admins saying they had to take down the post now as Sears was not happy.

That was the beginning of the end to me.

Also a reminder that Digg died because they allowed paid for content to rise above naturally curated content, the very thing Reddit does today."
"Look - you guys at /r/btc don't like /r/bitcoin, that's fine. You created your own sub to push/discuss your own opposing views. Why are you STILL complaining about 'censorship' (moderation) in /r/bitcoin? If people decide they don't like /r/bitcoin, they won't use it.

Stop making reaching arguments against how the sub is moderated to Reddit admins. They've got better things to do than humor disagreements between two subreddits.

You have your own agenda of pushing the BCH fork over Bitcoin, and  this act of 'shut /r/bitcoin down' is a very transparent attempt to disrupt bitcoin. Of course, reddit is just one forum - you're crazy if you think /r/bitcoin matters much in the grand scheme of bitcoin.  /r/btc however, is definitely the main hub of BCH...

"> Should I be worried?

>In how much trouble is bitfinex really? 

We don't know.  Many people here think they are (in) a lot of trouble.  Others think it is FUD.  Basically, we cannot know which is why you should worry.

If I had money on 'finex that I wasn't actively trading, I would move it out.  If I had money that I was actively trading, I would probably move it out anyway, and then take the loss in form of missed opportunities if it all blows over.

"
I don't know, but it's generally good practice to do your business somewhere else. Bitfinex has been known to fuck with their customers before, especially margin traders.
unless you are actively trading, it is a good idea to have full control of your assets. That means keeping your coins in a wallet that only you have access to.
It's not looking good and it seems to keep getting worse. Plus more and more people are having doubts and suspicion about bitfinex, it's only a matter of time before shit really hits the fan. 
Get that shit off to private wallets until the dust settles.
Panicked people will need to move coins to real exchanges for fiat. I'm not a prophet and can't guarantee that'll happen, we shall see. 
It's not. Finex has banking problems, there's no way they have real dollars backing USDT.
It will.  It will always stay a fake 1 dollar.
There's gonna be a _hard fork_ incoming. You don't just sit comfortably through hard forks. 
"The transparency page was down for months, came back up for one day?

It's like a loan, with no interest, that will never be repaid. If you're holding USD-T, you're holding that note.
I have BTC and have always been concerned about tethers. I don't think it's a BCH thing only.
The TOS clause is a liability dodge. Before they lost banking access you could exchange Tethers both ways.
"Tether issues $30mil of USDT, hands it off to Bitfinex and runs buy orders for a bunch of Bitcoin. Bam - price goes up. If they issued those Tethers on their own without the appropriate backing asset then it's fraudulently issued and the extra buy volume manipulates the price upwards. The usual investment crowd sees all that and decides ""hey, maybe I should HODL more"". So they put more money into the system, driving the price higher still. This continues indefinitely, until the market runs out of greater fools and the price collapses."
"> Should I be worried? 

Yes.

>In how much trouble is bitfinex really?

Lots."
"It will affect all cryptos. However, if it has mostly been used to buy BTC, it will affect BTC the most.

In fact, artificial inflation of the price of BTC might even be partially responsible for some of the loss of marketshare as real investors simply weren't buying it (no pun intended) and began to diversify."
Agreed.  It may stunt or slow down growth but won't stop it.
"Yes! Generate that fear! ""Market cap!"", other coins! I mean sure you can buy a TV with Litecoi non Overstock, but don!t tell people damnit!. I don't know about the other 3rd rate coins you listed, and bitpay having a monopoly of payments will surely doom us all!

Prediction: they will not be able to withdraw for anything!
"I would have thought so but the immediate reaction was a large drop across most of the cryptos.  Things are popping up fast now.  But yeah the expected result is that people buy everything that isn't USDT spiking everything in the short term until USDT implodes and then the crypto market drops due to the confidence hit.

The real problem is that no one knows what Bitfinex is actually up to.  No question there is something fishy it's only question of how bad it is."
Yeah, makes no sense.

it's the lesser of two crimes tho
And when did the hack happen?

"I think they actually have everything backed by usd. What I think they do (personal opinion, I have no proof) is they 
1. Print usdt
2. Buy btc with usdt low
3. Make the price rise because of usdt buy
4. Sell back when btc price is up 500-1000 usd
5. Now they actually made at least the same amount of profit as what they printed
So in other words, on the moment of printing they don't have the money, but they actually make this money with btc manipulation. The losers in this story is people using bitfinex"

Lol. Open your eyes. Or stop shilling.
How can you even believe that xd
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test
Ah I see. So it is somehow conflict of interest for them if some users cannot withdraw back their money to Fiat 🤔❓
Shouldn't those pairs start to go way up as people try to get out of tethers?
Oh no tether is hacked sell your BCH for tether quick!
this is retarded. you dont have a massive security breach on tether so people dont focus on tether. thats stupid, think for a second
How could they be insolvent when tethers aren't liabilities (because they disclaim they have no actual value)?
The fud part is that the collapse of tether will harm btc. It won't, as we already see in the markets. Honey badger don't mind.
Yeah, everyone's eyes are on Tether BIG TIME now.
It would allow them to pass a simple cash audit with $30 million less in their reserves.
Because then they can say it's a hack

"There's a lot less legal liability (if any at all) when it's in the form of a token they disclaim has no actual guarantee of value.

""There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers."""
This is my hope as well.

if there was something off, prices would be way off on bitfinex or tether. there would be signals on the market. bitcoin had a huge premium on mtgox that went on for months before closing. mtgox had like 80% of the volume back then. bitfinex only has like 20%. it is the biggest one but korea or japan pass them from time to time. so no. I dont believe on the conspiracy until there is evidence either on the markets, or an actual paper trail. anything else es pure speculation

There are like a half a billion dollars in tether.  If people lost all that money they would panic and it would effect the entire crypto community.
"you are wrong. at least the announcement contradicts what you are saying

>$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on November 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem. The attacker is holding funds in the following address: 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r. If you receive any USDT tokens from the above address, or from any downstream address that receives these tokens, do not accept them, as they have been flagged and will not be redeemable by Tether for USD. "
is the black listed address from bitfinex? So you are saying bitfinex got hacked again for 30 million. picked 30 mill tethers and froze them?
"That doesn't explain anything. It is just a bunch of tweets from shill/FUD accounts...


Maybe I should have asked for the ELI4"
"You must be among the same bunch of shills who defended them when they paid almost all of their last ""hack"" with [funny money](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/bitfinex-never-repaid-their-tokens-bitfinex-started-a-ponzi-scheme-86a9291add29)."
30mil is A LOT to manipulate price 
That $30 million can be many multiples of itself in daily volume.
Exactly we hit $8200.... so far I’m not seeing any tether or bitfinex motive. Hacker still seems more likely. 
Why exactly do you think bitfinex would steal from itself only to confiscate it back from itself? That does not make much sense to me. 
LOL this is amazing xD
They could just revoke some USDT they hold though so what would be the point of claiming a hack? 
"This article should have its separate thread.

>* Bitfinex gets ‘hacked’ and loses $72 million dollars of their customers funds, then seizes 36% of all user balances.
&nbsp;
> * Due to Bitfinex listing the fork, the ‘market cap’ of Bitcoin Gold… is a whopping ~$2 billion dollars. In the past week, there have been over $35,000,000 (estimated, lowball) of trading.
&nbsp;

Now we have 30 million USD in Tethers (allegedly) stolen. Anyone keeping money on that exchange is crazy."
Hard fork != free coins. Only a chain split gives you that.
Go find a Tether printing press. Maybe Bitfinex is selling an older model on eBay.
Why has archive.org been seeing server errors? Guess tether just have their server config messed up, you are right you can actually see the page fine...
Yes. *Totally not a scam.*
Strictly speaking, the purchase of the Bitcoin with USDT itself is what drives up the price, since it puts more demand on the buy side of the order book. But yes, the main driver of the increased prices is Bitfinex manipulation. Wouldn't be surprised if they were also responsible for the BCH price spike too...
I hear you. I personally try and avoid trading on news/FUD/trends. Way less stressful haha
"""... Allegations of tether sexually assaulting a teenage girl have surfaced, more after the break"""
Haha,  nice! 
Kevin, is that you?
It is probably more about avoiding jail.
With 30MM/day in fees how could they not insure Tethers though?
Bitfinex produces that money if the trading is real and not wash trading.
"they dont need much in r/btc
"
We'll believe what we've seen with our own eyes, and you can believe whatever you choose to believe. Feel free to fuck off now.
All Korean and Japanese exchanges dont accept Tether. Coinbase, Bitstamp, GDAX, Gemini, and Kraken dont take tether (kraken has a usd/usdt pair tho)
I don't usually say this but I think you guys are onto something. +1
In that case you'll likely see similar speculation across all exchanges simulataneously, but bitfinex led everyone else by far.
"We'll see what finex says tomorrow, but it's like that they'll announce: ""oopsies that is our address, sorry you bagholders got hacked monies, it's all [gone](https://imgur.com/lcxyE0D) now. Really sorry for your loss!""

This has both the effect of being suddenly responsible for ""backing"" $30m less Tethers (while making off with the BTC monies) _and_ throwing off people on their trails since market cap is now reduced. 

Alternatively Bitfinex can run an even more dangerous fractional reserve and pretend nothing happened, now less 30m USDT people cannot withdraw. Idk what that's gonna do to the market though. "
Kraken is good as well I think. 
i love conspiracies like anyone else on the space. but if there is nothing there, theres nothing there. yeah no doubt bitfinex and tether are involved in some shady deals. I bet they are involved in insider trading, and give preferential treatment to big clients. but to what extent that affects the price. i dont think by any signficant margin. If there was a problem Bitfinex would always lead, and there would be a gap between the price there and on the rest of the exchanges. particulary those that have nothing to do with tether
so archive.is worked but archive.org didn't? hahahahahahaahahahha
\#methether?
because the us govt is very zealous about their dollars. i would agree is a bad idea try to play loop holes with the govt. but thats a complete different matter
It's very hard to get insurers for things like cryptocurrency exchanges.  Which is understandable when you look at the security record in the industry (spoiler: not great).
[deleted]
I mean, he's right. You're making a leap when you say it's a bitfinex address. There is no concrete proof of that that I have seen. We saw the Tethers move to a previously unknown address, some speculation and guesses as to whose address that is, and then saw the BTC price jump on Bitfinex. So it would fit if that was a bitfinex address (or a bitfinex user!) who used the newly deposited USDT to pump the price. But there's not hard proof.
you didnt answer the question. you just repeated your conspiracy theory. And im all for conspiracies but this one has no legs except pure fud.
Coinbase claims their coins are insured.
If they are doing it themselves, they are just paying themselves, so they are not making money.

Only two, Gemini and Gdax. Shits fucked bro
but why would they blacklist that address if tether has control over it then?
Spot on In my opinion! A lot of people will be hurt when this all comes out..
my hypothesis explains the phenomena as yours. its actually the correct one until proven otherwise, because we are assuming good faith on the system since people are willing to send them money. the burden of proof is on you, and so far i haven't seen anything substantial
We watched the goddamn thing live right here on /r/btc yesterday, and some people in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7e1840/the_30000000_usdt_printed_two_days_ago_have/) are tracking it. If you don't believe it I don't have the time, energy or obligation to convince you. 
"Everybody on /r/btc saw with their own eyes yesterday that the BTC spike started at finex _right after_ the USDT movement, order book was just that amount, there's no way it's not a backdoor finex address. 

>got hacked again

There likely is no hack, this is Tether printing 30m USDT, buy BTC and move it elsewhere, now wanting to cover their tracks. We shall see what finex says in short order, they're in cahoots after all. "

You must ad up the volume of every exchange that allows you to buy bitcoin with tether. Cause if that tether is thin air then all crypto bought with them where bought with thin air. 

So tell me, what exchanges don't accept tether and have a good flow of fiat in and fiat out?

The only ones I know is Coinbase, but I don't like the fact they are in a battle with IRS about handing my info over. 
They have no banking problems because they have no banking. :)

Tether's transparency page has been up for weeks solidly up until just 2 days ago.
It definitely shouldn't be. But those who benefit from rising prices will be more inclined to turn a blind eye.
[deleted]
"So basically:

1. 30 million tethers move.

2. People assume they are gonna be used to buy bitcoin on bitfinex which would raise the price.

3. Everyone tries to get in on bitcoin before the spike, which causes the price to rise.

4. The tethers are never actually used to buy bitcoins since they weren't sent to bitfinex but the rise has already happened based on speculation."
Makes you wonder if the first hack was a hack... man
this sounds more plausible than the theory of the hacker buying a bunch of stuff
They are claiming hack to a community of hackers. This won't end well for them. Pure cover up. Word to the wise, move any bitfinex crypto into hardware if you are long term hodl. If short term cash out now and buy the incoming dip, When this is uncovered and bitfinex and tether go down so will all of crypto crash temporarily. 
Check my reply in this thread for a good timeline.
I reviewed that thread and there does not appear to be information there that backs up your claim. 
Gox was able to do what Gox did without USDT, Gox only serves to prove my point surrounding all the USDT FUD. As you can see, the market clearly isn't buying it. 
"But isn't that what just happened?  The lesson here is hold bitcoin. Don't keep your money on exchanges. The same things we always say.

Shrug, it doesn't seem to be affecting the rest of us much."
Next up, the tether is coming out as gay.
Yeah,  I refuse to use any tether pairs for this reason.  Friends don't let friends use tethers.
That’s the worst case that could happens.
im talking about the crash of all cryptos as a result of what happened, not the loss of people's bitcoins
"I know it's not the real market cap for all currencies because just a snall amount are put to circulation but the model is sort of accurate is for Bitcoin which currently stands for over 55% of the total.

Even still, my point is that price per bitcoin has increased 20 times since Q2 2016, ethereum 35 times, monero 140 times and the list goes on and on"
Ah, so finex is buying up Bitcoin with USDT that has no backing, then reselling it back into the market and that's what's driving the price ever-higher.
people have been unto them for a while. if they are really up to something they probably already stopped. i dont think they are willing to kill to golden goose just for a quick buck. Reminder that Bitfinex produces 1 million dollars on fees every day

Ok I admit that this story sounds like complete BS and It's hard not to suspect Bitifinex has been up to some shady shit but I don't agree in the FUD that this will affect  Bitcoin in any way.

It uses OmiseGo running on top of Bitcoin. 
"So you're saying a $200 billion market cap on cryptocurrencies which don't even have a use case and fullfil a real function yet is sustainable?

Where can you use iota to buy groceries?

Where can you use litecoin to buy a television?

Or ripple, or dash or any of the other currencies?

The only exeptions are the two bitcoins. One which is currently unfeasible to use due to ridiculous transaction fees and the other one is still awaiting full adoption by BitPay.

It's a nobrainer that this is a bubble fueled buy tethers and get rich quick mentality"
Correct. Tether uses the Omni Layer for their USDT tokens. The Omni Layer is very similar to Counterparty.
It's a token that a company called Tether claims to back with USD 1:1. Theoretically makes trading between USD and cryptocurrencies a lot easier on exchanges because they don't have to deal with fiat payment methods like ACH and wire. Problem is, it literally says in its TOS that you cannot redeem a Tether for USD, and audits have been fishy or non-existent. So we have no proof they aren't just creating tokens out of thin air without actually backing them with USD. And even if they weren't, I wouldn't trust a service like that doesn't actually let you redeem your tokens for USD. 
"It's a cryptocurrency managed by a company called Tether which pegs the token USDT to real dollars at a 1:1 ratio. That is, you can pay Tether money to issue USDT and you can pay Tether USDT to retrieve ActualMoney again. Or at least that's how it works in theory. In practice Tether is run by Bitfinex, which has had no traditional banking access for like 9 months at this point and is most likely either completely scamming everyone, doing some incredibly shady shit to service large investors only, or both. Much of the ""rise"" in cryptocurrency valuation (even BCH) is driven by Bitfinex's obviously fake Tethers."
I'm still really new here and thought there was some hysteria here regarding Tether but damn, you guys completely called it. Not very often a subreddit narrative is proven correct.
"What if the hacker deposited to Bitfinex knowing he wont be able to access the bought coins and hacked tether but opened same time long positions on other exchanges?  
He could've use the tether to pump the price and make a lot more than $30M just from his long positions..."

You want regulation? This is how you get regulation.
Some shit is definitely going down.  BCH price on exchanges that deal in USDT is getting out of wack from exchanges that trade it against the USD.  If tether is in trouble I would expect people to buy anything but Tether on the USDT exchanges.  Strange.
"Beginning of the new bear market? I hope not. BCH had an amazing run and ETH was about to break its six month triangle. 

I hope this bullshit passes. What a load of fake inside job garbage. The crosshair were on Bitfinex/Tether so they made a big distraction... I wonder if the 30 mil covers them to make them solvent. Or will there be future hacks too and completely destroy peoples trust?"
"Lol. They're asking to blacklist any downstream address from the ""hacker"" address.

They are talking about destroying fungibility.

If Bitfinex has banking issues and cannot work with USD, so that all USD trades and USD holdings work on USDT instead, wouldn´t it explain how they can easily pump BTC with their Tethers?

"How about the harm when people figure out Bitcoins have been bought with made up money and that a big chunk of the current market price might be made up too? And not just bitcoin, all crypto. 

Point is in the current eco system of exchanges there are many that accept tether. Now tether is 1/1 with the USD BUT you can't actually redeem it for USD. Basically Tether is saying: trust us guys, the USD is all there. Okay there you go here is 30M tether, go buy some coins on that exchange. Okay here you go you can have 60 M tether go buy some coins on that exchange. But has Tether received 90M USD? And how? What fiat bank is cooperating? Fiat banks don't like this new kid on the block and they do what banks have always done: they block access to whomever they want to block access too. 

So what happens? You have an eco system of exchange where it's not to hard to get USD in but very hard to take USD out. What happens when you keep pumping air in to a tire? It explodes. Nuff said. 

Gox 2.0 now with extra salt and 800% gains on drama. Poor souls that got in to bitcoin after the price skyrocketed from 5000 to over 8000 in like a month, their fear of missing out is going to make them miss out ... on their fiat money.

or maybe. the 30 million was for some big shot company that wanted to buy in. they issued the tether, the company bought at the exchange. and for whatever reason that tether got hacked and moved to a different address, where it then was frozen.

This is probably what happened 
People on that sub are skeptical about tether too and saying the same thing.
As long as it stays $1, I'm cool. 
Sounds plausible, saved for posterity.
I lend out USDT on bitfinex, seems fine for now.  I expected a spike in interest rates but hasn't been much change.  What's funny is tether has gotten more valuable with respect to cryptos as a result of this.
We called it based on evidence and suspicion. Unlike BTC, we actually have logic and sense, hence the scaling and fork away from lousy and expensive BTC coins. Tether was based on the fact that finex has no way to receive it withdraw fiat, so it doesn't make sense that they can create tether that has 1:1 link to USD when they don't even have any banks to provide the USD backing needed to issue tethers.

"The phrase dead cat bounce alludes to the fact that a dead cat only bounces once.

Eh. Source for this? OmiseGo is an Ethereum project.
It's like a loan, with no interest, that will never be repaid. If you're holding USD-T, you're holding that note.
I’m curious how tether is influencing the price of BTC/BCH?
i specifically remember reading in their ToS that they do NOT exchange usdt for usd
It's not really a cryptocurrency. It's a centralized token issued on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It's what you might call a color coin. 
"Yeah and when the exchange bank runs start and the mempool fills up and everybody panics and tries to replace by fee with an even higher fee. And the bitcoin price is tied to all the other crypto prices cause bitcoin is seen as the unsinkable ship and most people trade crypto for crypto, they don't send fiat to these exhanges. They buy some crypto and then send that to exchanges and then trade and then they can do everything internally. 

This creates a skewed view on things like market cap. The fact that all these crypto exchanges are unregulated and can pretty much do whatever they like does not help it their favor. We have seen what happened with  mtgox. That was one party balloon, now there are 200 of them with a house tethered below them full of hodlers trying to fly to the moon.  I hope they brought their parachutes cause gravity behaves quite differently outside of a dream. "
The implication here is that Bitfinex (i.e, The joint owner of Bitfinex and Tether) is scamming the whole market. While they are using BTC,  a panic sell on Bitfinex will cause all the prices to drop and a chain effect on the whole market.
Yes also it does ride on Omni which is a second layer on top of BTC like Counterparty.

Impossible.  Crypto will go around any regulations.
Unfortunately, all crypto is affected by this shit, not just BTC.
"Is that true? I'm not sure how tether works, but if it were btc or bch you could manually craft a transaction to sweep every unspent output _except_ the ""bad"" one to a new address, and then that address should theoretically be clean, unless people implemented overzealous blacklisting. I'm not sure if it's possible though, and it would be a PITA at best.

EDIT: just realized that most people probably store USDT on exchanges, so the exchanges would have to implement this

Not sure if this is frowned upon here, but this feels like a damn good time to plug Monero which is immune to problems like this by design"

Errr... doesnt that make complete sense? 30m was hacked, balance sheey is 30m negative.
It would make zero sense for them to create USDT out of thin air for us all to see to then buy BTC on Bitfinex when they could just edit their ledger on Bitfinex to create more USD within said ledger, run a fractional reserve, and use that fake USD to buy up Bitcoin. Then we wouldn't even know about it, so why in the world would they do it in a transparent manner for the world to see by using USDT? 
May I ask what's your LT crypto ?
"Because it a fake theft. They will use it, and then they will reject to redeem those tokens. Right now they $30 mils in the red, after this ""simple trick"", they are back in black. "

This Omni token is just a fork and the new fork will contain more tethers.  Shady as fuck and I can't believe people use them.

r/bitcoin is the worst thing for bitcoin after tether
And 10 hours later, new all time high for BTC again. High fives all around!
Are you new to crypto or something? You're already shilling?
Maybe because $30 million worth of Tether was really stolen from them? What gives this Tether value is that they redeem it for USD. Well they aren't going to pay a hacker $30 million. So they are informing everyone that the Tether form that address which was stolen will he blacklisted and will not be redeemed. So all users and exchanges must be informed about this so that they don't start giving customers or the blacklisted USDT (which is worthless) in place of USDT which has value. This also means they stop the hacker from selling the USDT and profiting, to the extent possible that is. 
"BCH/USD is holding on Kraken  but the BCH/Tether pair is way down on Hitbtc and bitfinex.  Hit btc has withdrawals suspended for ""maintenance"" right now.  Kind of funny this is happening at the same time as the Tether news breaking and right after a mini price pump."
Don't know what chart you're looking at, but Bitfinex is showing BTC down by 1.5% and BCH down by 2.19%
Enjoy the panic sells
"Someone allegedly stole 30million dollars worth of tether.  The people in charge of tether issued an update (hardfork) that makes all those coins worthless and unaccepted by the network.  They want everyone to upgrade to the new software so that they don't accidentally accept the worthless money from the hacker.  They are also maybe working on an update to return the money to the people it belongs too.  

...However, a lot of people think this is suspicious and that the hack wasn't real, it's just a way to cover up the fact that they are creating money out of thin air."
Because Tether is the sister company of the largest crypto currency exchange being Bitfinex. It's also what some smaller exchanges rely on in place of fiat (like Bittrex). 
If tether actually goes completely up in smoke I'm sure every crypto including BCH will tank 
What does it mean it was negative? Eli5 
"> You can measure monetary deflation separately from price deflation. I've never seen a case where significant contraction in the supply of money didn't cause a recession. In either case price deflation also seems to be pretty bad for economies (or bad economies lead to price deflation).

Ok, but you're saying that price deflation (a general decline in prices) is bad for the economy. And I'm pointing out that price deflation can have at least two different causes: monetary deflation or economic growth. 

>How is that the logic? People already have inflationary currency and access to deflationary assets, we don't have to speculate on what they would do with it.

Ok, but your previous comment imagined a scenario where you had access to both an inflationary and a deflationary *currency*.  So I assumed you were imagining a scenario where the deflationary asset had become extremely widely-held and widely-accepted for payments (so as to earn the ""currency"" label). So in that scenario, if I hold both of these currencies and all the people I buy goods and services from accept both, sure my incentive is to first spend the inflationary currency.  But that's going to be everyone else's incentive too. If nobody wants to hold the inflationary currency, its value is going to collapse and it will cease to be money, having been completely eclipsed by the better, deflationary money.

 >Money doesn't need to be a good ""store of value"" because money has no value except for helping exchange value. 

Ok but again, I think this is like saying that buckets don't need to be non-leaky because they're for transferring water, not storing it.  

>Money under a matress for 20 years is not generating value regardless of whether the money supply is inflating or deflating.

But again, think about what that money represents. It represents your ability to make an immediate claim on real resources.  When you don't exercise that claim immediately (and instead stick the money under the mattress) those real resources remain available to be used by others for either consumption or investment. That forbearance on your part thus is generating value for others.

>People use money for consumption, not savings. When people want to save they use money to buy things that appreciate like property or stocks.

People use money for savings too. It's just that money in the form of fiat currencies is such a poor ""store of value"" that people attempting to save across longer time periods would be well-advised to use their money to acquire some other asset.  So they attempt to quickly pour some water from the leaky bucket into a non-leaky but difficult-to-pour bucket. Later when they want to access their savings, they pour some water from the difficult-to-pour bucket back into a leaky bucket and then enjoy some consumption by ""taking a drink"" (buying some good or service). Of course, this only provides a net benefit if the amount spilled by the transfers is less than the amount that would have leaked away had the water just been kept in the leaky bucket. But again, what you'd really like is a bucket that doesn't leak or spill.

>A currency that people don't want to spend and just hoard isn't a good currency, its a deflationary asset, of which there are already many that have lots of other uses.

But creating a money that people are willing to spend isn't the hard part.  Of course people want to spend money. In most cases, that's all it's ultimately good for, facilitating exchange.  (You can't eat bitcoins.)  The tricky part is creating a money that people are willing to accept and hold.  And yes, there are lots of assets that are deflationary (expected to hold or increase in value over time) but there aren't lots of such assets that *also* have very low transactional friction.

>There is a strange, unexamined circular logic behind bitcoin proponents that says all the problems with bitcoins adoption as a functional currency because it was never intended to be a currency and its narrow minded to think that's all bitcoin can be. Then when asked to justify why its actually valuable, and why what we're seeing isn't just a spiral of speculators looking to profit from increasing price rises caused by , then it suddenly becomes a currency again, even though all the arguments for why bitcoin isn't a good currency were dismissed with ""well yeah its not meant to be a currency"".

Bitcoin IS intended to be a currency. But it obviously couldn't happen overnight.   The transition from (a) totally obscure computer science experiment (where it started in 2009) to (b) the most widely-held and readily-traded-for good  is going to take some time. I'd say the progress toward that goal has been pretty darn impressive but there's still a long way to ago. 

>Deflationary assets don't turn into currencies just because they hit a certain market cap.

Sure, the properties that make an asset ""deflationary"" aren't the only properties needed for it to succeed as money; it also needs to be extremely easy to transact.

huh?  there’s a commit that intentionally broke it? 
If one exchange is buying bitcoin for 3% more then it is going to attract a lot of sellers... Those sellers transfer funds to another exchange buying the bitcoins for 3% less and sell them to the highest exchange. This makes the price on all exchanges go up. Same thing happens when one exchange is seller cheaper coins. Usually it's cheaper/faster to use alts to transfer from one exchange to another

Yes it is! There are in fact signatures included within each and every transaction and block relayed on the Segwit network "
If I'm not mistaken, the witness data is only ignored if you run an old core client. New core client can download the witness data. This is how it was a soft fork. Old clients thought there was no witness data.
"There is absolutely still a chain of blocks, and there's absolutely still a chain of digital signatures, each required to unlock the previous transaction. Further, the order of the blocks still exists and is secured by the proof of work, so the proof of sequence of events is uncompromised.

The only difference is that now the witness data is no longer hashed with the following transaction. 

But it's not like moving the witness data means there's ""no chain of blocks"" as you claim, nor does it mean there's no chain of signatures -- every segwit transaction is accompanied by witness data as they are still required to be present for a transaction to be considered valid, just like they always were."
there must be a blockchain first in order to have the most accumulated POW. BTC does not have a chain of signatures, they removed the witness data from blocks.

Because the miners signed it, as well as some main market players, and so implemented consensus for SW. The miners and the NYA signatories backed out of the 2X part. It had nothing to do with Core, apart from the fact that they said they didn't agree with it in the first place. Core were ready to fork to their own UASF SW chain.

> Every transaction and block produced by miners & relayed among Segwit nodes includes the signatures, right there as part of the data structure.

As a developer I agree with that quote from looking at the code myself; saying it's not a chain of digital signatures is simply not true."
They are validating it at the time it is spent but they no longer require the signature in the block history. Implications are you can steal if you can generate historical blocks — so a few blocks in secret and then broadcast them ought to do it.  I suppose miners who get lucky can do this every once in a while but it would be interesting to read more on security implications and risks from someone who has analyzed it more closely.
"I thought the contents of a blockchain is arbitrary from a technical standpoint. A blockchain of digital signatures is bitcoin. But a blockchain is not necessarily a chain of digital signatures.

For instance, a block can be empty. No signatures. But it is a block in a blockchain."
"I see.  You can fault me on that.  I am looking through the lens of consensus governing.  It's like how bitcoin is decentrally centralized through the protocal.  A paradox of sorts.  Like you know... how rules aren't arbitrarily added without the rest of the network agreeing to it first.  That kind of integrity.

BCH made it's own network to undercut all of that, so can you see how using the word ""upgrade"" can be misleading?

">In this case, I was using to address both transactions AND the ruleset.  

The rules are obviously not ""immutable."" It's an inappropriate use of the term.  BTCs rules have changed many times, such as with Segwit."
"> The problem is that the witness data is not hashed into the block anymore

That bit's not true; the root of the witness data's merkle tree is included in the coinbase transaction of the block, which is part of the merkle tree for the transactions in the block, which is part of the block header. There is a provable link between the transaction merkle tree and the witness merkle tree via hashes. 

> so the signatures are no longer part of the block definition.

Clients don't get the witness data as part of the initial block's data, true. So the signatures aren't in the block's definition, they're now a separate ""witness data"" entity. So, it's moved somewhere else, but the link still exists in a provable way.

It's like the separation between a website's source (HTML) and its CSS/Javascript. CSS/Javascript can be embedded directly into the HTML document, so a web browser has to only make one fetch for the data, or they can be served separately, so the browser makes two fetches. The ""Website"" as an overall package is in multiple pieces, but it's still all there for browsers to fetch. Some browsers may opt to disable CSS/Javascript, and they can avoid that second network call, if they're happy getting an incomplete picture of the website. Websites typically don't have a verifiable link to the exact version of their CSS/Javascript, while Witness data does have such a link to the transaction data, so that's where the analogy breaks down."
Perhaps, but this was about far more than just adoption.
No, it is not. There is not necessarily a correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the fees. Fees are supposed to be a bid for block space. The price of Bitcoin has absolutely no bearing on that. To the extent that there is any relationship it would be that some people are feeling richer than they are and ignoring the absurd rise in fees, but more likely, it's because they're not actually USING Bitcoin, and instead hoarding it.
It because fees rise 100x just because btc rose 100x. It is not the sole problem, but i wouldn‘t call it irrelevant.

"Why is it just BTC? I thought other crypto's were also traded in USD-T including BCH? Also, why was Roger Ver comfortable moving 120,000 BTC to Bitfinex, and why deal with that exchange in the first place when there are other options out there? Why not bittrex if the intent is to exchange BTC for BCH, coinbase for BTC to USD, or Kraken for BTC to BCH or USD?

I understand /r/bitcoin is heavily censored, blockstream is centralized, and there is a big dislike, but at times I wonder to what extent is all problems to be attributed to BTC. 

Even last week had me skeptical after the FUD spread around BTC and the FOMO spread on BCH leading people to buying high and selling low. I feel like a great degree of skeptisim for /r/bitcoin and /r/btc is warranted. Especially for people very new to the crypto game.

Either way, one thing is for sure. Stay away from USD-tether."
What explains the price increase on all the other exchanges then? 
"they are most likely both played like a fiddle.

Honestly both sides seem stupid at this Point. Both sides seem to be orchestrated by a few People. Wish another coin would make the race (ETH, XMR or smth...)"

"this sub created years ago long before bitcoin got splits into legacy bitcoin and bitcoin cash?

And it's a pump and dump because our bitcoin actually works and works as described as p2p money...?


How, exactly?"
Bitcoin core and bitcoin cash have exactly the same miners.
where do you honestly get this idea? I am curious. do you not know what a mining pool is? Do you think the legacy coin isn't mined in china? 
While I'm annoyed by your vitriol, I am in agreement that the site is pretty confusing right now. I went there to download a Bitcoin Cash wallet, but didn't see the option. They were offering a wallet that supported both, but they don't make that clear at all. I had to download the thing before I learned that it supported both BCH and BTC.
oh now you've done it, I'm totally convinced!
If it focused exclusively on Bitcoin Cash the number of visitors to the site would drop dramatically. When the average person goes to bitcoin.com they expect information about Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash. That's the simple truth. If it focused exclusively on Bitcoin Cash it would have to be renamed bitcoincash.com, which would mean far fewer visits.
I HATE censorship.

Yup, company. How decentralized!
What happens when the miners burn through bcash so fast they hit the halvening sooner than bitcoin and the rewards drop by half? Bcash has already got way more coins than bitcoin, with low fees and half the block reward what do you suppose happens? Fees go up? or miners ditch it for something else more profitable? serious question.

Core and their shills and advocates are the actual scam artists... actually they are just scammers. Nothing even remotely artist in what they are doing. 
They control the codebase too.  So it’s more than just the narrative. 
Any argument that hinges on the death of bitcoin lacks actual knowledge in the technology. There is no doubt with the people pimping it that bcash will not die, maybe even becomes worth more, I guess the market will decide. But this is a HUGE problem with bcash. There are a lot of dishonest marketing campaigns being run on bcash too, that is a huge drag too.

"Sorry, I don't buy this. 

In your argument, you have one exchange whose price is being supported by 'fake tethers' and all the other exchanges in the world being supported by new investors. If that is the case, more BTC is being bought by new investors than by fake tethers (the transaction volume attests to this I would imagine). If this is the case, the price rise is genuine, if just a little inflated. 

And not to.mention this high fee business is being exaggerated hugely. A fee is about 50c at the moment. "

Over the same period, Bitcoin Cash is up 278%. Bite me."
The whitepaper says the longest chain is bitcoin. It's loosely implied this will always be the chain with the most accumulated difficulty, but it may not be true is the difficulty adjustment mechanism is changed, like it was with bitcoin cash.
Nobody owns the trademark, this is uncharted territory, there isn't even a consensus on how to reach consensus.
"> is the chain

exactly. segwit broke the chain, it is not a chain of digital signatures. the witness data was removed from the block. if it's not in the block, there is no chain of blocks.

>The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed,

there is no proof of the sequence of events witness in BlocksTreamCoin.  "
A segwit chain is not a bitcoin. It is not a chain of signatures.
Does BCH have most accumulated difficulty? I must have missed that. 
He needed a break from editing the Satoshi whitepaper and attempt to rewrite history.
No no no, chinese miner get more BCH from asicboost. No asicboost on BTC so not as much profit. Need everyone use BCH. Everyone trust china

"To be honest, most of annoyance seems to be that he advertises BCH as the real bitcoin. he has every right to believe this, but is not actually true as the definition of Bitcoin is the chain with the most accumulated difficulty.

I am not following you. BCH is preforming just as well as Bitcoin when it comes to syncing nodes. It seems you are suggesting that Bitcoin Cash cannot handle Bitcoin's hashpower as well, but this is false. If 100% of Bitcoins hashpower were to switch it would no cause any problems.

Thank you, this changes everything.
I used to love Bitcoin Cash, but this post of yours is a revelation.  Consider me converted, oh wise one.  Take me to your leader
What a revelation! 
"About that CEO thing.. that was used ironically.  IMO not smart, since evidently people like you abuse it to smear bch. The whole point of that post was ""everyone is CEO"".. "
will you fuck off?

Totally. Also, it takes time to see through the lies and make up your own opinions. $76 million buys a lot of trolls.
"> so is like cryptos a religion now

Indeed. If you want to know how religions emerge just go read /r/bitcoin"
"Well he's right. r/bitcoin and Blockstream will crucify everyone who goes against their narrative.

Remember how they attacked/smeared Gavin A, Mike H, Peter R, Jeff G, Roger V, Jihan W, Rick F or Coinbase, VIA BTC etc. etc.. They are control freaks. I find it quite sad how Bitcoin businesses feel need to kowtow them in order not to get smeared.

Bitstamp shows some class here though. They call Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Cash."
Yes? 
The sarcasm is strong with this one

"No no...he's funny as hell.

We need his level of expertise here. It will make BCH look double good."
">just go read

*any* crypto subreddit. Lets be a little self aware."
Sure, I recognize fully that /r/bitcoin has actually and sadly been mutated into something of a cult/cyber terrorist group that attacks anything they don't like
"Haha.

Anyway Rick talks smart stuff there. (as usual) It's funny that RT actually picked that CEO tag from his joke. :D"

"Confirmation from Bitstamp:

> Dear customers,

> In response to the demand we have been seeing for Bitcoin Cash trading (BCH) and as part of our efforts to list more currencies, we have decided to provide trading support for the following three pairs: BCH/USD, BCH/EUR and BCH/BTC.

> The launch is scheduled to occur in the first week of December.

> Please stay tuned to our Facebook page, Twitter feed and websiteannouncement page for further details.

> Best,

> The Bitstamp Team"
BCH Winning =D
"> Finally.

The environment of fear and intimidation from Core fanatics means that company's just wanting to do business and not take sides have to go out of their way to not trigger them.
Bitstamp attacking Bitcoin?! Adam Back, Samson Mow, please do something!
That's in 2weeks!
Well, I guess Blockstream could reimburse them.
Great news. Stamp.. stamping!

"This is huge. Bitstamp is one of the more trustworthy exchanges and has free SEPA deposits from Europe.

I've always had good experience with them. There was one hack, but they took care of the aftermath responsibly and were very transparent about what happened.
"
Glad that I contributed a bit to the push! I emailed their supporting team two weeks ago and they said they were still investigating this issue. I guess they received hundreds of such inquiries amid the recent price hype. 
About damn time.
This is huge news.
"For those with ad blockers

>Bitstamp, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it will launch trading of Bitcoin Cash, a new currency that many Bitcoin supporters view as a rival.
>
>“We get requests from our users who want to trade it,” said Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodric. “We want to be as agnostic as possible so we look at the system, and if we believe there is sufficient demand and there will be trading and trading volume, we’re going to list it.”
>
>Trading of Bitcoin Cash on Bitstamp, which is the third-largest in the world for U.S. dollar and euro trading of Bitcoin, begins in the next couple weeks. The move could indicate possible growing acceptance of a cryptocurrency that many hardcore Bitcoiners view as an unwanted stepchild of Bitcoin and potential threat to the top cryptocurrency.
>
>It's also significant because Bitstamp is one of the more conservative exchanges and currently only offers trading in the other four cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum's Ether, Litecoin and Ripple's XRP — that round out the top five by market capitalization. It was the first nationally licensed Bitcoin exchange, a designation that applied across all 28 European Union countries.
>
>The near-clone of Bitcoin was created in August by a group of Bitcoiners who disagree ideologically with the future development plans for the original cryptocurrency. They instead support a certain method for increasing the number of transactions that can be processed on the network at any given time that is generally known as “big blocks.” Bitcoin Cash currently has a market capitalization of $20 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $137 billion.
>
>Earlier in November, another so-called fork of Bitcoin was scheduled to occur that would have again created a new version of Bitcoin, this one containing elements of compromise for both camps across the ideological split. However, this plan, called SegWit2x, was called off, and so many of the ideologically driven big block supporters have instead begun pushing Bitcoin Cash.
>
>“There are still people out there who think Bitcoin should have larger blocks, and right now Bitcoin Cash provides them with exactly that,” said Kodric. “I think that’s why some of the demand emerged — SegWit2x didn’t happen, so some of the attention pivoted toward Bitcoin Cash.”
>
>Bitcoin Cash has come under criticism from the Bitcoin community for its small developer community, calling into question just how decentralized the cryptocurrency actually is. Many also believe that market manipulation may have pushed up the price of Bitcoin Cash over a brief period earlier this month when the price skyrocketed from a low of $650 on a Friday to a high near $2,500 the next day. It has since dropped to about $1,200, while a Bitcoin is worth roughly $8,200.
>
>[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own Bitcoin.]
>
>Kodric acknowledged the suspicious activity but said it was impossible to prove. Instead, he noted that Bitcoin Cash’s trading volume has been roughly half that of Bitcoin, “so we would prefer to leave it to the market to decide.”
>
>Kodric said that to list a cryptocurrency, the exchange evaluates its technology and the market supply and demand for that coin.
>
>Regarding the politically charged atmosphere around Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Kodric said that the exchange has not generally been supportive of the big block side, and did not sign the agreement to do the SegWit2x fork. “By listing Bitcoin Cash, we’re not endorsing anything,” he said. “We’re just a marketplace where people can go with their money. We’re not doing any harm to Bitcoin or anything beneficial to Bitcoin Cash.”
>
>He compared the battle between the two sides to the cola wars. “Coca-Cola invented the sweet, dark, bubbly drink, then Pepsi copied everything 90-95% from Coca-Cola, and they marketed the recipe with bigger bottles — actually, similar to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash at the moment — and they did an aggressive marketing campaign to promote Pepsi, and a bunch of people went to the Pepsi camp and said it was a better drink. Maybe a similar thing is happening here. We’ll have two cryptocurrencies similar in the technology having vocal, strong and sometimes aggressive supporters. We’re in the business of allowing users to to trade whatever they want. We’re not taking any side.”

"Winning ✌️and a win for ☕️
-

Europe is about to experience true decentralized electronic cash **again** ... with over 510 million EU citizens and SEPA bank conectivity, BCH is at their fingertips (merchants, developers, ATM providers and many more)."
"Completely biased towards SegWIt Core Coin.

I guess the pressure from ever growing opportunity costs was getting too high. I would estimate the Bitstamp has at least lost $10MM in fees from not adding BCH until now."
"Finally !!

They said they would do it but I was starting to get really impatient.

https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitcoin-cash-bch-trading-be-launched/ 

According to their website they'll start the first week of december."
YES!
Bitcoin is money backed by greed, so it's unsurprising that they'd enable it after seeing what they're missing. This is one of the hidden incentives that Bitcoin brings, and why Cash will win out in the end. When you align the incentives, you don't have to struggle so hard, just let people figure it out if there's money to be made. If there is, they'll join.
"> Bitstamp, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it will launch trading of Bitcoin Cash, a new currency that many Bitcoin supporters view as a rival.

This kind of makes you think.  There is so much manufactured hate, and sheep that follow into hating Bitcoin Cash, calling it bcash and making lies about people, and dirty tricks and so on.  The amount of temper tantrum fits they throw is really astounding.  I think anybody who sees that kind of thing, realizes BCH is a true rival and threat to segwitcoin.  As they react with such triggerings, it shows everyone just how strong Bitcoin Cash is."
Fantastic. 
Does this mean Bitstamp traders are getting BCH deposited to their account as well?
Thank you for posting that link, I was looking for it on their site but they hadn't posted it yet

"Those soy boys were so busy licking core's butt that they initially cancelled their plans due to the disapproval of the NO2Xers, now they're afraid of total irrelevancy while still slagging ""big blocks"" in the article."
Wow.great news for us .Win for bcash.
We've been waiting for this
Thats awesome, Bitcoin Cash trough the roof https://coincodex.com/crypto/bitcoin-cash/
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e7n15/this_scam_is_unacceptable_lets_do_something_about/

Right here. How about misrepresenting bitcoin? As well as causing noobs to send btc to a bcash address. "
So it's a wallet that has bitcoin *and* other crypto in it. Most recently added, bitcoin cash. Nobody says Jaxx isn't a bitcoin wallet because it can also send a bunch of other currencies.
