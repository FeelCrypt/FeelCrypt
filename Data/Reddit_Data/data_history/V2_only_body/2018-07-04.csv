I think if you are a wise man then you will tranfer money in the form of cryptos as it has the least transference fee until now. Stay blessed!
"> But, this is an argument over semantics. No one “stole” the name from anyone. That is a fact.

No, the person you replied to has it right. Core stole the name, and that is the actual historical fact. Core is the core of Bitcoin because Core says so - not because users agreed, not because miners approved; simply because it has been asserted with dominance and defended with unrestrained technique (sans regard for honesty or common good). Demand for a block size limit increase existed in 2014 - before SegWit had been *conceived*! - and even then, developers that were so bold as to present *proof of concept code* for a capacity improvement were branded as ""dangerous to Bitcoin"". Code that would only allow larger blocks if 75% of the last difficulty adjustment's blocks signaled support for larger blocks was the tipping point for what would later become Core: branded a ""dangerous altcoin fork that threatens Bitcoin"", Bitcoin XT and its developers (having already been expelled from the bitcoin-qt development process for their heresy of supporting a larger capacity limit) were forever branded as Attackers, and joined the ever-increasing ranks of ex-Bitcoin-supporters. Consider a scenario in which Bitcoin XT was adopted by miners enough for such a majority of signaling - at this stage, bitcoin-qt would no longer define Bitcoin, and its development team would no longer control it. Such hostile resistance is predictable with clear hindsight. Still, some changes would help prevent such a situation in the future, and soon bitcoin-qt would become Bitcoin Core - a change in more than name: the development policy of permissionless participation would be the primary victim.

Since then, r\/bitcoin has announced and enforced a strict censorship policy against all development proposals and the dev mailing list is read-only for non-Core participants. The BIP process has been changed from a public review to a private one involving a few specific decision-making individuals. If you don't agree with Core, your idea isn't Bitcoin, period. [This is how it has been since 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/). It was *decreed*, not *agreed*, what defines Bitcoin - and those who *were* using Bitcoin were told ""if you don't like it don't use Bitcoin, or make your own fork"".

**So we did.** With the help of many prominent members of the ex-Bitcoin community, Bitcoin Cash became a reality two years after that linked post, and a year of all-out internet war against Bitcoin Cash and its supporters was the reaction. It is eerily like the early attacks on Bitcoin when it began to gain traction - all the same techniques, all the same mockeries, all the same projections. ""Bitcoin Is A Scam"", they used to say. ""Bitcoin is just a way for people smarter than you to steal your money."" On one screen running a DDoS against block-producing nodes, and on the other posting to social media that ""Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme with miners at the top.""

Bitcoin Cash - a scam? Is Roger smarter than you? Does Jihan operate a pyramid scheme? Or is it just that Bitcoin Cash is that same existential threat to global money interests that Bitcoin was in 2013? I cannot decide this for anyone but myself; I can only present evidence to support my argument.

3. IrfanView (an offline image viewer program): Loops.

Perhaps the gif is set to not loop but your viewer/browser is ignoring the do-not-loop flag? Dunno what's going on otherwise."

Wow look at these tips, can anyone add up how much he made from this?
^ what that guy said haha 
It's destroying their prophets...I mean profits.  I never put anything into BTC from the time I got into crypto because I thought it was one of the shittiest in 2013 with all the alts starting.  Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't.  Wasn't interested in Bitcoin, itself, at the time because of throughput.  Alts had it stomped when they were coming out.  Glad Bitcoin has now had blocksize increases because it's working great.
nice job very cool!
