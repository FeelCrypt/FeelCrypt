I'm considering some real estate. what other diversification would you suggest aside from anything associated with fiat currency?
It will keep rising now matter what. 
Don’t directly take financial advise from a dude on reddit. But do carefully look into stocks or bonds. You can make a solid 8% a year on long term investments. That may not seem flashy, but after 10-20 years it will be a huge sum of cash. Like doubling your initial investment in 10 years
how are people and new money buying tethers first? thought you buy btc then sell for tether
"He did, I'm just saying the idea of tethers itself is clearly scammy and I'd never put my money on it even before this post and other similar ones.

I consider anyone who accepts tether in a trade either dumb or careless, unless they get a good premium for the risk of accepting it."
A spark is enough to start a fire. If you do it persistently, there's only so many coins on exchanges. 1 billion to move above ATH is enough. That's roughly 70000 at current prices, there's around 1.5 million bitcoin on exchanges. So as you can see it's pretty easy. Currently a 100mm $ can put bitcoin to 100k per coin of executed simultaneously on all usdt exchanges
"Sometimes they really hide it.  99% of the people that trade on QuadrigaCX, the Canadian exchange, think they are trading CAD...

But the truth is:

All account fundings are considered to be purchases of QuadrigaCX Bucks. These are units that are used for the purposes of purchasing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. QuadrigaCX Bucks are NOT Canadian Dollars. Any notation of $, CAD, or USD refers to an equivalent unit in QuadrigaCX Bucks, which exist for the sole purpose of buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

They are 100% using USDT as USD. I sent them an email asking about it a while ago and they straight up said it’s not USD but USDT.

Don't short anything, you gonna have a bad time. They can pump this up a lot bigger before it implodes.
MY husband and I used Quadriga to cash out, but that option (afaik) is only available to Canadians. Can Americans cash out using Coinbase?
"But that's not what a Central Bank does? 

I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was to avoid interference on the price by the government (or private) entities

So, if I get this right 

+ Some entity is using Tethers ( a virtual equivalent for a dollar) to create an artificial saturation on the Bitcoin market, exponentially increasing the value of the crypto currency. 

+ This new money is literally backed up by anything, and  they never told anybody

+ After artificially increasing the value of the Bitcion, they started selling at  high prices and, after the crash, they will start buying low, making themselves rich

Is that it?"
"I think the point /u/peptocurrency is making is the follows: 

1. People have unique addresses they deposit to on Bittrex, nobody else has access to your deposit address (fact). 

2. Bitfinex moves USDT directly from their wallet through a couple address (say, 1AA6iP6hrZfYiacfzb3VS5JoyKeZZBEYRW) to Bittrex, the content of which makes up the overwhelming bulk of Bittrex ""known"" wallet at 1DUb2YYbQA1jjaNYzVXLZ7ZioEhLXtbUru after(fact). 

Hence even if you don't assume 1DUb2YYbQA1jjaNYzVXLZ7ZioEhLXtbUru to be under finex control, the bulk of its content comes from a a single ""deposit"" address which can only be finex's. There are no multiple independent arbiters. (implication)

Also: As I pointed out 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX takes the bulk of ""recycling"" from _both_ Polo and Bittrex back to Bitfinex. It's either a _single_ arbiter doing this, or it's Bitfinex themselves. If it's Polo or Bittrex doing it, you'd think they'll use two separate arbiters instead of just one. "
Can you or anyone post a link to said correlation?
Hey, if that's actually the case, the good news would be that they're adding inflation to USD and making Bitcoin (slightly) more valuable by comparison
"Like https://twitter.com/bitfinexed says, what investor is investing $800mm into a firm that just got hacked for $30mm, won't go through an audit, flash crashes, and looks like a scam (/r/bitfinex)? 

CoinBase has raised $217mm, is FDIC insured and is working closely with the SEC and IRS."
"> want to be wrong on this. I hope I am wrong on this because it is insane to me that the company printing typing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fake money out of thin air is the same company that controls the majority of that fake money, where it primarily exists on cryptocurrency exchanges.

sounds similar to USI tech and its.. special sauce"
I suspect something similar is happening with IOTA. It is going up for no good reason. And coincidentally it is mostly traded on Bitfinex.
Basically a supposed digitization of the US dollar
Look at the tx history, it's overwhelmingly wash trading (very blatant too!). Books are very thin so it's impossible to liquidate any significant amount there - and if you try using, say, a million USDT market sell you'll lose a _lot_ of money to shallow books, in addition to not even moving the price since wash will bring it back up. The amount of actually maybe legit volume is so low, it can basically be considered a sham market.
Well, remember that a sub for any exchange is only going to be full of complaints. The Coinbase sub is the same way. When's the last time you called customer service to tell a company they're doing a great job? People don't post about their good experiences so you only see the negative ones.
This will only be a small hiccup for a few months. Whatever crypto takes BTCs #1 spot will be over $300b market cap next December.
It's actually difficult to get back to FIAT and a lot of new investors don't understand this.  Lots of exchanges now only do crypto in crypto out.  There are very very few that get you back into fiat. I normally just go to a BTC atm or meet with a local trader physically if I need FIAT.
BTC's last drop, during fork uncertainty, caused alts to grow.
Sick quip bro
"How do you know Tether is used to pump Bitcoin?

Are there really a lot of Bitcoin owners that sell for Tether? There has to be a lot of Tether owners now. Where are they, who are they?

If there are actually real dollars deposited somewhere corresponding to the Tether, it will be a zero sum game, having no effect on Bitcoin.

Why is it Bitcoin that is pumped, and not the other cryptocurrencies?"
Eventually the world will burn as a result of the actions of a few corporations, but hey, the end of humanity is worth it to keep shareholders happy. 
Lots of corporations have a vested interest in the traditional banking system.  If they can kill crypto and make profit while doing it it's a win win.
I'm going to assume you downed too much Adderall, because you just seem to be getting all conspiracy theory over something that's completely normal.  Go get some sleep, mate.
Only for small fluctuations. That never held during previous crashes.
"Gotcha.  Must have been the NASDAQ Futures I was thinking of then.
"
I hope you're right. I hope that all is fine and that we just misunderstand how all of this works. Truly. I hope Bitfinex and Tether come out clarifying some of our confusions and (hopefully) misunderstandings about the way they operate. This would ease my mind so much.
"So if it's an error/ignorance on CMCs part, anyone could notify CMC about this, and their reply should show their motives, right?

Isn't it illegal to advertise a product as something else as well? Not saying CMC is advertising, but what about the others mentioned in OP?"
I would think many people believe this. If most of the very recent buyers of crypto are in it for the gains, then it stands to reason they plan to cash out at some point. How do you cash out if not through an exchange? 
More likely, it's people trading for small but viable margins.
Ez money kid, sorry you've got no balls. 
When bitcoin hits a spike, everyone tries to get in on it before going back to their alts. 
Thanks, insightful to hear different peoples perspectives. After reading up on the distributed ledger/tangle of IOTA I'm also starting to wonder if blockchain is inherently unsuited for quick and cheap currency transfers while maintaining the other core aspects of security and decentralisation. But IOTA seems very focused on IoT and not currency and so maybe the search goes on, or back to some Bitcoin version. Or maybe the technological innovation is accelerating too quickly for us to timely adopt a promising ICO without the immediate backing of some giant. Which might be a terrible waste of a once in a human species oppurtunity. Almost terrifying to think about.
"None of these are conspiracy theories. How is the fact that an exchange can create a currency, create as much of it as it likes without any sort of backing, and claim it equal to the dollar? 

There's no answer to where this money came from. If I was a bank or some sort of stock exchange, and you either wanted a bank certificate saying you have $100 of balance, or a stock that says you own 100 shares of a company, *they're backed by money or an actual company*.

What is Tether supposed to be? A 1:1 to the USD. So if it's equal to one dollar, *it needs to have a dollar in backing for every Tether*. OP is pointing out they Bitfenix owns all the Tether and seems to be ""printing"" more without having it backed with anything, and they also happen to own most of their currency that has no proof of value. 

I'd be kind of concerned. Saying OP must be on drugs over magic money is pretty weak. I mean otherwise, I'd love to sell my new currency to you that's 1:1 of the Euro, I swear it is."

"> The corporate giants want Bitcoin and CryptoCurrency all to themselves.

I don't think they want it to themselves.  I think they want to drive it super high then crash it hard to protect the regular banking system.  They ultimately NEED to destroy BTC and the crypto community because in the long run it threatens then entire banking infrastructure."

Tether does not represent money. This directly contradicts the claim that 1 Tether represents $1.
I think we're risking skewing the understanding of this by taking the analogy too far. I was trying to ELI5, but they aren't banks, they're exchanges. Exchanges make their profit primarily off exchange fees when people place trades. Any asset added to an exchange benefits the exchange by virtue of more assets available to trade, thereby increasing exchange fee revenue.
It's both.

He makes the fake money. The town is using the other 1/4 that he already made. He still holds 3/4 of its entire supply. Get it? 
"> If it's 1:1 USD to USDT then what...

There is no way of auditing to check if that is true and I personally suspect it isn't backed at all because you cannot redeem a USDT for a USD. Backing is a lie if one cannot exchange the secondary good for the primary one. Funny enough, a similar situation took place in 1971 when Nixon did away with the gold standard for the dollar."
I appreciate it :)
"If it's 1:1 USD to USDT then what reason does anyone other than Tether and their parent exchange have for accepting it? I don't use any of the exchanges so I don't understand what it is used for. I thought it was a substitute US dollar value holder to skirt the regulations on running an exchange on USD, hence why they write ""this is not money"" on it in the small print and making it more like a $1 redeemable deposit on a pair of bowling shoes than a coin, crypto or not. Those bowling shoes are worth the value of the deposit but only inside the bowling alley, because everybody outside the bowling alley is using real money."

"You know what Bitcoin holders say when I bring this up? Meh, 800 million is only 0,5 % of 200 Billion dollars that is being traded so nothing bad will happen. Around may of this year the market cap of all crypto combined was about 25 billion dollars. Then in just 8 months it went to over 400 billion dollars. That is times 16! Has user adoption of crypto grown 16 fold in 8 months time? No it has not, in fact adoption has gone down especially when it comes to Bitcoin. So what is going on? Well just think about it: Fiat banks can kill any crypto exchange by freezing bank accounts. So there are two routes to go --> 

- to legalize crypto and give it it's space within fiat banking so crypto will be traded on regular exchanges or crypto exchanges will become way more regulated then they are.

- for crypto exchanges to go even more unregulated and try all kinds of tricks to bypass the bullying banks.

But .... for any fiat to go back to people holding crypto, there is no escaping banks! 

If you check out all these subreddits /r/bitfinex /r/kraken /r/coinbase /r/bittrex 

you will find something that has been like it is even in the times of MtGox. It's very hard getting fiat money on a exchange by bank wire and it's even harder getting money back. There are tones of places on the internet where you can instantly buy bitcoin paying with your credit card  but to even get half a bitcoin worth of fiat on your bank account can take weeks. 

And so we have this super big crytpo exchange that supposedly is worth 400 billion dollars! But how much of that can flow in and out the system in fiat? Let's say somebody wants to sell 10 million dollars worth of crypto and get fiat for it, is that even possible going through exchanges instead of finding a buyer and doing everything directly one on one?  So what is that 400 billion dollars worth?

What is up with all the korean exchanges that within a year when from hardly any volume in Bitcoin to half of all the volume? 

How much wash trading is going on? If I constantly buy and sell my own crypto all day long I can generate an enormous amount of daily volume and if then crypto prices go up and I use the market prices to calculate all the USD that you would get for that crypto the end result is a very high daily volume. But since it's so hard for a regular person to get fiat in and out of the system all this volume is just crypto to crypto and does not mean much.

And what is up with when Bitcoin goes up, most other popular crypto go up to? That correlation is insane.It's like there is only one crypto.


No, I don't know when but I am confident a second MtGox is in the make. I am not saying these exchanges are a scam but it's just not that simple. Crypto is still borderline illegal. Governments and banks don't have a unified policy towards it. Banks can at any time freeze accounts that are affiliated  with exchanges and use the ""money laundering"" excuse, even if the exchange starts a law suit and wins it, who knows how long funds are frozen ... and then if the price goes down customers of that exchange are fucked because they can't sell.  

If crypto wants to survive it needs an internal market. it's own economy where people buy and sell good in crypto and get payed in crypto and pay their internet service provider in crypto.

For that it needs price stability and user adoption. If it does not get that, then crypto will stay 95% oh look this is very valuable, look at how fast it's getting more valuable! 

So even without all the Tethery stuff you can see there is a price bubble that does not live in reality where things are valued based upon more then just how fast they increase in value. It's the dotcom bubble all over again at hyperspeed but with 99% online. And this time any criminal that plays it right can get away with a small fortune in crypto without anybody even knowing their name ... even if crypto tanks 80% in price the next year .. just be patient. Some crypto will have some value for at the least the next 5 - 10 years and probably even long after that.  

This is a disaster in the make and some many people will loose money. I believe in crypto as a valid tool to give people more independence and to make payments on the internet better and faster and to make people less dependent on banks but this is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to go political and start slowly integrating the concept of crypto in to society. Don't fight the banks and government. First cooperate. 

Crypto needs stability. This is madness. "

"You can withdraw your CAD from QuadrigaCX.  I think that basically their QuadrigaCX bucks are a way to be considered legal in the Canadian market.  If they really held $CAD for their users, they would surely have to follow a different set of rules, and that would cost them a lot.

But that also means that if something goes wrong, customers are not protected as well as they should."
My husband and I both withdrew from Quadriga to our bank accounts. It wasn't alot - maybe 10k total - but we used interac e-transfer and had our money in about 24 hours.

Found the real tldr. Finally I get it!
Yikes. Isn’t this a huge case of fraud then?
"A whole bunch of people are going to realize the hard way there is nowhere to cash out their ""sick gains"" when the forces behind this scam pull the plug.

They will also not be able to move their BTC when that happens either because the network will be extremely expensive and stuck in the mempool for basically eternity while everyone tries to escape through the same mouse hole. That is of course assuming their BTC balances actually exist, because they might not if the exchanges are in fact running a fractional system while exporting the real BTC out. 

*Holds BCH and ETH tight*, get your helmets on gentlemen. 
"
"I think this is the case. I have a Bitfinex account and I'm Canadian. Yet despite being verified I could neither deposit nor withdraw in USD, only coins. If this is typical (and I think it is ... I haven't read of anyone complaining of a slow USD withdrawal, just coins) it means Bitfinex isn't receiving any USD, which in turn means all their USD pairs are most likely USDT.

At best this is false advertising. At worst it's fraud. BItfinex pumps in fake money that they never have to redeem for *real* (fiat) money.

The other exchanges transact in fiat.

Nice gig if you can get away with it."
This is the real TLDR. Thanks for clarifying!!
The problem is I need a million dollars in USDT to collapse it, and a willingness to lose a significant chunk of it, and patience to maintain a slowly descending sell wall to kill wash. I don't have that, and there's no incentive for any whale to do that community service as long as dumb money keeps the music going.
"Well, go collapse it then. If tether is all a sham then it won't be able to sustain it's peg at one of the only exchanges that actually offers a direct $ rate. Let's do this sooner rather than later. If you can't collapse it from selling tether into real $ then maybe the system is working as intended and it's irrelevant whether it's really backed or not, since the backing is only necessary to guarantee the peg.

Edit: Not trying to sound hostile, just trying to play devil's advocate. With all of this FUD around bitfinex and tether, I can't think of any reason someone hasn't already tested this out, since it's supposed to be the only reason tether exists."

The Fed has the world's biggest army, the IRS and FBI behind it. If Tether has that many mercenaries to enforce taxation I'll recognize it as legit.
yeah i like the things it wants to do, but theres no real working product other than wallets at the moment
on polo, if the price of btc is dropping, you can sell the btc for usdt (tether) which is stable.  Then when the price bottoms, convert the USDT back to bitcoin. when the bitcoin goes back up, sell it back for USDT at the top.  Rinse and repeat. that's how it's being used by the layman crypto trader
Not everyone in the crypto space is on Reddit. Reddit is the only place I've heard this and I've been watching the markets since before USDT became a thing... I think that this is simply incredible research and we happen to be the first to hear about it (there have been escalating posts like this for months..  should start telling your friends to avoid it)
"> but who sell their bitcoin for tethers and why?

Arbitrage bots.   They send Tethers and BTC (and a dozen other cryptos) in a big circle keeping the price similar on the exchanges that support tether."

"The most concerning part:
> Bitfinex holds USDT on their exchange, yet doesn’t offer USDT in any of their trading pairs. That's insane to me because Bitfinex is the only Associate of Tether in Tether's legal terms. If they do offer USDT, they're calling it USD which is sketchy as hell.

Essentially, people selling BTC on Bitfinex may be selling for USDT *whilst thinking they're selling for USD.*

Which would explain the state of /r/Bitfinex right now where people are unable to withdraw funds... Oh my, this could be very bad."

There hasn't been a big correction in BTC yet, since BCH launched. So, while maybe that inverse correlation will hold on a small scale, I have a hard time believing it will when events occur that shake faith in cryptocurrency itself.
Why is everything that we're talking about in USD, when last time I checked, they don't allow people in the US to make accounts with them/closed US accounts? Kind of glad now that I was blocked from making an account this week

What you say here is all correct. However none of that is new. In addition the auditing problem is the same for keeping any currency on an exchange.
Agreed

If it's on an exchange, then the exchange controls it. Are you after the identities of the people who instruct the exchange? If so, the only way to determine this is above board is by regular auditing with reports released to the public domain... Oh.
"> All these exchanges will run dry on FIAT money and run into serious Banking problems. Unlike Mt. Gox this could result into a cascading effecting much more exchanges then just one causing the scam.

Yes, this is why we keep repeating that Tether is much worse than Gox, because it seems likely to induce a *systemic* collapse."

The conclusion of this post is that Tether/Bitfinex (they're one in the same) control 3/4 of USDT in existence across 3 separate exchanges, and that the BTC/USDT pair makes up almost 1/5 of BTC's 24hr trading volume. Make of that what you will, but the most concerning thing is that Tether is worthless, it's not even money and it's being created with zero proof of the existence of the required reserves. This is Federal Reserve level power. The power to create money backed by nothing. In the hands of a private company, who hoards 3/4 of it for themselves and uses it to profit across 3 exchanges.  

&nbsp;

>Bitfinex would send them specifically because, as you said, they are basically Tether. Why is that weird?

That's not what I said was weird. You're directly acknowledging that Bitfinex does indeed own all these accounts, so I can see that you do agree they control 3/4 of the Tether in existence. That's a lot of buying and selling power in the hands of one group. I'll leave it at that."
"Thanks , now I have more information...wow, that's freaking crazy. If OP is right, this fraud is gigantic, all the crypto currency are going to be affected

Of course, if this is true. We don't know if that's the case yet"
"> OP has discovered that most of this monopoly money is used by a single person/group and makes up a really large part of daily trading.

Not only this there's ZERO connection to a tether in a bank.  Tether says they have bank in Taiwan that backs them up but if you converted 500 btc into tethers and flew to that bank to get cash they would laugh at you and then kindly walk you to the door."
This will get really ugly, maybe even sooner than we think!
That's only true if there really isn't a dollar backing the tether. Bitfinex is a fucking behemoth of an exchange. Who is to say they don't have the money at 1 USD to a tether? 
[deleted]
Haha, yay! The currency I have to pay taxes in, get paid in, and take loans in and feed myself with is being inflated by crypto! We're winning!
"At least at Bitfinex, customers won't be aware they're cashing out to USDT. The trading pairs all state USD. If it's really USDT (as I suspect) then there isn't anything to withdraw.

Imagine how this ends if people sell their crypto on Bitfinex for USDT, when they really think it's USD. They're in for a rude awakening when they try to withdraw. "
i agree , this is what people are doing and they are stupid.
People should collectively stay away from exchanges that deal with USDT.
I've heard lots of talk on reddit and medium about tether going back months but you're right it's not getting out to the rest of the crypto community.  I think people that are making money using Tether don't want to hear about it and also don't understand systemic risk.
hmm.. actually I still don't see the correlation when looking at that. Could you explain what I am looking at? I see that the price often goes down whenever tether was printed, not go up.
It's USt'D, right
Quadriga also, for us Canucks. USD or CAD if you like.
What about Bittrex?
I'm now learning of the existence of USDT and it is reminding me of what I used to call Gox Bux, the fake USD you could trade bitcoin for on MtGox shortly before they closed down for good.  Sure it was making it look like the price of BTC was high because MtGox was THE exchange most bitcoin price indicators went with, and it was showing a much higher price than the exchanges that actually functioned at the time, due to nobody being able to get their gox bux back out except by rebuying btc and sending btc back to yourself.
And how long have you been paying attention to crypto?
Because BTC pumpers are also controlling the alt markets and are not ready yet to cashout ... When they are really going into fiat, alts will go down with BTC.
"Just to expand, you theorize in your OP that tether constitutes between 6-17% of BTC trading volume. 

So let's say Tether trading shuts down, will it then decrease demand by 6-17%? Following that, would you then estimate that BTC is also overpriced in the range of 6-17%? I'm far from an economist as you may tell, but very curious about the potential effects of this."
Keep telling yourself that. All $40+ billion in ether wouldn't disappear. If BTC drops 30%, Ethereum takes a hit. If BTC drops 90% Ethereum will see at least a 40+% rise after a nasty correction.
Sunday?  I thought it was 2018 before the futures market opens.
It won’t inflate USD because it won’t change how much USD there is, it just steals it from others.
"THANKYOU!  I'm so glad there's some rationality here, I feel like no one even read the mess of an OP.

Tether seems dodgy just because they won't get a proper third-party audit.  That is enough to steer clear.  We don't need these weird ""analyses"" which essentially just show that Tether is being moved to exchanges that list USDT, lol."
"It's not about ""not understanding"", it's something completely different.."
As a policy, they  generally only make changes based on requests from the official team of the platform. Bfx isn't going to make the request. 
Alright, great post anyway. Hope we can resolve this tether mystery soon so we can all get some good sleep.
"I get that but why are separate banks accepting and holding deposits in ""this is not money, this is our bank's internal bookkeeping voucher, we repeat this is not money"" tokens when they can't do any bookkeeping on that bank's books? What value does the second party bank gain?"
The only currency getting inflated in this scenario is USDT if it turns out not to be linked to USD in any way.
Honestly I probably wouldn’t short anyway because it comes with the implication I’m gonna be profiting off of people being swindled which is morally wrong.
"Seriously spot on.  Fuck global finance and their extreme greed and manipulation. 

Even if this Tether thing blows up and takes half of the crypto market down the tubes it's a good thing because we successfully defeated what's basically a corporate attack on the community.

Better to blow it up now at 433 bil market cap then at 3 trillion market cap."
But is there a liability created for tax purposes? That would be a money maker. 
"It's all good, man. I didn't feel like you were attacking me or had a weird tone. I appreciate your ability to present an argument without coming off as condescending. That's hard to do through text-based comms.

Alright, so if Bitfinex-B belongs to a miner, what are they mining? They are receiving Tether to this address, which isn't a coin that's mined. Also, why does it receive hundreds of millions of Tether from Bitfinex-A? 

If Bitfinex-A (Bitfinex) is sending Tether directly to a Bittrex deposit wallet, then that deposit wallet belongs to Bitfinex, no?  

>A Bittrex deposit address would always receive Tether and the automatically forward it to the Bittrex hot wallet which is exactly what this address does.

Except I've used Bittrex and any time I've deposited anything there, I can view it on the blockchain existing inside the address, having never been ""forwarded"" to another central wallet. If they're moving the coin after I deposit, how do they make it look like my deposit address still contains coin on the blockchain?"
I value the effort but a lot of the conclusions are wrong or falsely contributing malice to something that is not nefarious.
Crypto currencies are fucked when this thing explodes.
Can we get a tldr so I know how to feel about this 
assume the tether market collapses as it is revealed to be a fraud.  what then happens to BTC price?  how far does it crash?
"""Easy come, easy go. Little high, little low."""

No they aren't. Bitfinex trades actual USD and now EUR these can be deposited and withdrawn. Tether is jsut a secondary option to deposit/withdraw USD to/from Bitfinex. This also allows users to redeem Tether for USD by depositing it into Bitfinex. 
I thought this too actually. It would make sense if they did it like that, because they are essentially saying tethers are digital USD, or that USDT = USD. So hiding their tethers and making them seem less dangerous by just calling them USD seems like a good idea from their point of view I imagine.
Bcash? You said guess who... can't ban me 4 that 
"As I said in my own post these ""flush"" wallets are simply the deposit addresses of users on certain exchanges. Their purpose is not to ""flush"", ""rinse"", or obfuscate the transactions in some way, its simply for accounting purposes on the exchange. This is obvious because people like us are able to easily track them so this activity is not done to hide anything.

 The exchange sets up an address for a user, automatically calculates all the transaction amounts through that address for debiting the users account, and then forwards that token into the exchanges hot wallet.

The tell tale signs are

1. The address does a high amount of volume
2. The address only sends funds in one direction
3. The address usually has a 0 balance"
"These conclusions are panicky non-sense and draw Bitfinex in an overly negative light. Bitfinex is one of the largest, and most successful exchanges. Unlike he implies, no user ever lost money on Bitfinex. They got hacked, but always paid back their debt. They have proven again and again that they are trustworthy.

However, I agree that someone should do a better tether with proven reserves. Btw: there are many reasons why they would want to be secretive about the reserves. For example, they might want to prevent that money from being associated with Bitfinex, as that might get their bank into trouble."
Not to mention that molesting scumbag Brock Pierce created it. He seems like a real ethical guy. I don't understand how anyone ever allowed that piece of shit to be the head of the bitcoin foundation. 
"Can I get a TL;DR here please, as someone who has a casual interest in crypto and was considering buying into bitcoin lately? "
[deleted]
USDT on Bitfinex is USD. There is nothing sketchy about that. 
FUD
"Long and complicated post and while I’m sure it’s all factual, the main thing that stood out for me was the intent to “outline who owns the majority of Tether, where it’s located and how much of BTCs trading volume it makes up”

So this is going to sound really simplistic (so apologies up front if I’ve missed something obvious) now as I can say I’m not really across it, but still want to put the question out there:

Q: Could the half a billion Tethers equate to some proportion of Bitfinex’s profits?

They are turning over 10s of billions of dollars per month where even a small (conservative guess 0.1%) percentage fee results in 10s of millions of profits.

I’m not saying what’s wrong or right but just testing whether there is a case where the 1:1 pegging may hold. 

And if so then there shouldn’t be a problem with it being used in trading right? (Certainly not withstanding the “trust” matter where Tether can be printed way beyond the 1:1 of course)

Happy to have this hypothesis shot to pieces by the way :)"
"If you listen to this Tone Vays podcast:

https://youtu.be/edi4vIrjX3o?t=403

It seems that most traders don't care if Tethers are backed or not by actually USD, as long as the price goes up everyone hodling is happy. I personally believe that there's something fishy about the whole thing. People have been exposing Bitfinex's shady practices since 2013 and nothing has happened and probably never will."
So they're printing meme^2 money and selling it to other exchanges, cashing out meme money and then selling it for real money. Smart move.
"I have an acquaintance that is a pyramid scheme cluck. He is an ""At home Entrepreneur"" LOL. Anyways, him and his Facebook friends that go to the same online pyramid facebook college and are all ""Entrepreneurs just jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon.

I really appreciate your explanations, you're one of the very few people in this entire thread to actually rationally address the concerns I brought up. If you don't mind, I'm going to link to this comment in the post itself. I really would prefer not to worry about all this and let it all be what it is. Your comment answers a lot of my questions, though some still remain. And I'm not yet 100% convinced the Bitfinex-B wallet does not belong to Tether/Bitfinex.

If Bitfinex-B is someone's deposit address, and it has received Tether from Bitfinex-A, Poloniex-A and sent Tether to Bittrex in the hundreds of millions, whose is it? It can't be a Bittrex deposit address, because it proceeds to send Tether to Bittrex. Plus, why would the Bittrex wallet send Tether to the Poloniex-B cold wallet?"
Listen to the professor
"Hey thank you for that, friend! 

There's always the possibility that we're just all severely misunderstanding what's going on here. Which is actually my hope. In such a case, I would also hope that Bitfinex/Tether could explain what all this is about."

Either get out to real fiat (Coinbase, etc), or prepare to hold on to your ass as a hodler.
"If it blows up every single coin will be effected.  There will be no safe space.  However a 50% drop in coin that you have in a cold storage wallet is more valuable then losing all you coins on an exchange that crashes and won't let you withdraw and disappears into thin air like Mt. Gox.

The problem is there's no way of knowing if it fold tomorrow 6 months from now or never. Safest thing you can do is maybe take 10-20 profits into fiat and put the rest of your shit in cold storage or on an exchange that doesn't use Tether, and wait..."

Block chain technology is VERY useful and is being implemented is dozens of industries.  Even if bitcoin burns to the ground (it most likely will.  The foundational economics behind it do not promote growth or productive wealth distribution. The wealth inequality the surrounds It because of its slow adoption means it will not benefit the avg person in some revolutionary way.  Bitcoin promote the hoarding of wealth and does not promote spending wealth to create more.  There is no incentive to use your money to buy physical goods and services to build new wealth because of its deflationary nature. If anything it would just change who the top 1% is.)
">eventual collapse of BTC

Could you expand on why you think this is an eventuality?"
BTC collapsing will most certainly affect the entire crypto market, perhaps irreversibly. We are at an inflection point, where crypto is starting to go mainstream. If this tether business is as damning as it sounds, faith in crypto will take a big hit. And that's what money is all about. Faith. Once you destroy it, you can't bring the masses back.
You don't have to, the idea of Tether is plenty retarded by itself that no one with more than 10 brain cells would accept it in a trade. 
"> mostly because a group of ultramillionaries just wanted to avoid taxes

Damn I never thought about that but it makes perfect sense.

This is why I'm libertarian. You try to tax these guys and they just dodge it anyway.  We need simple taxes on land and maybe a VAT that's hard to avoid.  All other taxes should be ignored."
I've never gotten into crypto currency before but I'd like to and given I just saw you use it, would you mind telling me where to get BCH?
Even if we are we can recover from it.  I hope it blows up now instead of at 3 trillion market cap.
If this scenario is true though, I can't imagine the scammers are holding it in crypto. Print fake USDT > buy Bitcoin > transfer to an exchange with the pair BTC/USD > trade for USD and withdraw. Flawless counterfeiting/money laundering scheme of real US dollars.
"A lot of people assume that when they sell their bitcoin on Coinbase, etc and go to withdraw, the money will be there to pay them out. The fact is, with any volume, there won’t be. In fact I’d wager that across all exchanges, there’s an 800 million dollar shortfall representing Tether that has been minted, and used to purchase crypto, then having that crypto sold on a separate exchange for USD, and cashed out for fiat. 

If there’s ever a run on an exchange, try to be at the front of the line. I imagine they lock withdrawals pretty quickly. "

"I don't get what the problem with thether is. In my understanding it is a simple scam coin.
Why all this research? All you need to know is that someone can centrally print it! 

Everyone who buys it can do so if he thinks is a good investment, it is his responsibility.
But as stated by OP nobody except themselves buys USDT anyway.

So what can they do with it? Buy their own bitcoin?

I seem to miss something. Can someone explain me what is so dangerous about it except buying the scamcoin? Thanks."
I feel violated. 
"So if Tether and co. holds 73% of tether. They would be most affected by their own scam.  
Not that what they're doing is any good, but just saying."
the realization that monopoly controlled tether with no real relationship to usd has been used to inflate the btc price + the upcoming short sell option on nasdaq will probably be enough to burst this bubble 
"I'm very suspicious of Tether, because if there's a way to exploit a system for money, it's likely that someone is doing it. That said, I've got some questions about your assumptions:

- Regarding the fact that those accounts hold much of the Tether, are very active, and operate between exchanges: Could this be explained as benign control of supply & demand on exchanges to keep the 1:1 ratio with USD? 

- imo, it should be expected that exchanges hold most of the Tether. Nobody really holds Tether in their accounts, right? It's mostly just used to trade, which means people only hold it for a brief time. But exchanges have to have a lot on hand in case trading volumes spike and everyone wants to trade USDT at the same time."
What's the main usecase for tether? (Rhetorical question).  Arbitrage.  Arbitrage requires a quick easy way to transfer assets in both directions.  USD isn't well suited to this, but tether is.  Arbitrage bots are transfering tether back/forth between the exchanges on a huge scale, and that is why tether is sent between the exchanges so frequently.
If I had unregulated means - with no legal oversight - to create tokens that could be in turn directly exchanged for BTC [and other crypto], I would pump the market while selling older purchases to rake in the profits. Near zero investment or risk, with only gains to see. Exiting could be as easy as OTC BTC for $USD transactions, big off-market purchases made by those wanting in are great. Technically, the momentum the movement created would create could artificially increase organic volume and new money flowing in, which would act as a stabilizer or safety net. Done over a long time, this is a great way to make a ton of money without impacting the market negatively, and continue the wave indefinitely.
Thank you for your research 
Interesting timing with CBOE hitting the market this Sunday evening and CMEs next week.  Anyone have insight into how this could play out for the next few weeks?  I’m guessing big institutional money will short BTC and drive price down.  If the implications of this post are as big as they appear and the public catches wind of it, price may plummet...then would be a good time to buy back in.  
Ok, so you explained how tether works in great detail. This is supposed to how it's work according to their business model.  Are you implying that there is something shady going on? If so, what?
"If you can't buy and sell coin for USD without getting into tangles with the US.gov you just buy and sell USDT.

How do you get cash from here to there?  USDT.

How much of this can be explained as just laundering US dollars to avoid KYC laws?"
Really good research my friend. We have a new Fed Reserve (Tether), picking up as much free crypto as they can.
This may be a stupid question, but what is preventing them from just proving, without a doubt, that they actually hold the usd?
"Great work OP. /u/tippr $1

I’m really surprised these exchanges reuse deposit addresses. If they were smarter they would move smaller amounts to new addresses and it would actually look like real user growth. Once criminals get smart enough to use coins with proper privacy, how are we going to catch them doing things like this?"
"The person who trades their bitcoins for tether is the one who loses when tether pops, rather than tether causing bitcoin to pop.

It's the same as if someone printed up counterfeit USD and bought someone's bitcoins with it. The person stuck with the counterfeit currency loses, it doesn't devalue everyone's bitcoin."
"If Tether is redeemable, then how come the tether in circulation has NEVER gone down? 
"
My god... this sounds like MTGOX on steroids waiting to happen...
"Guys, please read all the articles written by ""Bitfinexed"" on Medium and Twitter.

If you like money and gains, liquidate your position immediately before there is a run on the exchanges."
"Seriously great research.  I've been screaming about the tether scam for months now.  I hope it just blows up now instead of when the market is at 3 trillion.  We can come back from this.

"An excellent, yet horrifying write up here.

All of this fits in line with the Bitfinex/Blockstrea/Tether/DCG circle of basically turning Bitcoin into fiat 2.0, effectively replacing central banks like the Federal Reserve as the central issuer of currency, forcing everyone to use their wares. Bitfinex is their market warfare arm.

It may be tin-foily, but banker conspiracies absolutely do exist and are very real. You have to wonder if it really is all just a shadow play by the FED and other global super-banks to try and curtail Bitcoin into the next fiat system before open source free-market money buries their centralist global vision.

The great Currency War is just beginning. 

"
">Think about these points. The only one who can be in control of this unknown address is Bitfinex. Here's why: 1) Bitfinex does not offer or trade USDT. Tell me what random soul out there is privately selling hundreds of millions of USDT worth of goods or services directly to Bitfinex, only to send their USDT revenue to Bittrex? Who in their right mind would sell anything in exchange for Tether? 2) It’s not Bittrex, because they would have received it from the Treasury if they had directly bought it from Tether for use in their trading pairs, the only place besides an exchange where you can get it. But besides offering it as a trading pair, what exchange would ever directly trade hard cash for a digital token whose terms of service explicitly outline its worthlessness?

I spend quite a bit of time following the addresses for my own trading purposes so hopefully I can clear up some of these points. The address that you identified as 

> 1AA6iP6hrZfYiacfzb3VS5JoyKeZZBEYRW (Bitfinex B as you call it)

Is clearly someone's deposit address on Bittrex. I know this because I've been watching it for months and have used its increasing amount of Tether deposits as a signal for when to long Bitcoin Cash, this trade has been very profitable for me. Its clearly controlled by someone very rich, but I don't think its necessarily controlled by Finex themselves. There are a lot of reasons why someone would want to sell any crypto for Tether. I don't consider it a red flag that someone would want to sell 100 BTC for tether and transfer it to Bittrex. In fact, I have reason to believe that this address is **Miner Controlled**. I would be happy to explain why, but I don't want to get too far away from the main point. Suffice it to say I believe your conclusion is incorrect. I think this address is a Miner controlled account on the Bittrex exchange which is why it never carries a balance for very long. Tether hits it solely for accounting purposes on Bittrex's side and then the money is moved into Bittrex's exchange wallet.

To address your point #2 all tether goes from Creation --> Treausry --> Bitfinex like you say. The treasury wallet never sends money anywhere else other than to Finex which is why I was aware of the ""hack"" 24 hours before it was announced publicly. To address your comment made in EDIT 1 it is my belief that both 31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv and 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r belong to the ""hacker"".

>Poloniex-A sent a total of ~180 million USDT to Poloniex-B up to November 28th 2017. It's just sitting there, with the occasional return spend back to Poloniex-A (the one Bitfinex owns).

On we go, I'm sure you have noticed this but its clearly obvious that the addresses you are calling Poloniex A and Polinex B are simply Poloniex's hot and cold wallets. They even went through the small trouble of getting vanity addresses for them

> (Polo A) 1Po1oWkD2LmodfkBYiAktwh76vkF93LKnh --> 1Polo
>
> (Polo B) 1Co1dhYDeF76DQyEyj4B5JdXF9J7TtfWWE --> 1Co1d

Your question is easily answered by this, its just Polo sending money into their own cold storage.

To address this

>EDIT 2: Incidentally, the Treasury hasn't sent Tether since November 19th. Is there a new Treasury? All we have to do to figure that out is go to the Printing address. Sure enough, it has been sending hundreds of millions of Tether to this new address (1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) since November 26th. This is the only other address the printer has sent USDT to besides the original Treasury. The patterns yet remain the same. After hitting the Treasury, USDT flows straight to Bitfinex-A.

Yes they changed their procedures after the hack.

And addressing your final edit

>1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX is the ""recycling"" address that flows Poloniex USDT back to Bitfinex. 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX doesn't just recycle Polo USDT, it also recycles Bittrex.

This is the only conclusion you have drawn about the owners of these wallets that I agree with. This is clearly a deposit address on Finex but this wallet does indeed seem to be owned by someone who's interests also align with Bitfinex.

Last point I will make is that I think you are attributing a lot of ""rinsing"" flushing"" or malicious activity to activity that really is just standard wallet activity. If you see a wallet that moves a lot of tether in one direction and usually carries a balance close to 0 that is most likely always someones deposit address on an exchange. It does look suspicious at first (it did to me) but really its just standard procedure.

It appears Tether Limited. is the holding corporation for the exchanges. If the exchanges go bust, the holding corporation IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.

DCG has a stake in Blockstream. http://dcg.co/portfolio/
So likely the CME listing of Bitcoin is thanks to Blockstream having control of Bitcoin now. Then Bitfinex is a shareholder in Blockstream & Shapeshift. https://twitter.com/Blockswater/status/778324389146263553
With Bitfinex in control of tether Blockstream easily could have manipulated prices in their favor. Makes you see Adam Back's confident bets on Bitcoin Cash & S2X forks in a different light since they likely controlled the futures market on Bitfinex. Then Erik Voorhees CEO of Shapeshift is likely involved in Crypto Capital a panama based company that provides banking for Bitfinex. https://medium.com/@mathias_61938/the-man-behind-the-curtain-81ecf49fa339"

"Bitfinex'ed Medium blogs are what started it all. It is a shame a lot of people ignored this.

It's pretty obvious this will blow up, soon. You only need a manipulation by the big banks to drop the value enough for Bitfinnex to struggle with margin calls and then it's game over.

Right now the increasing value of Bitcoins lets them continue this scam."
This is extremely worrying
This is why I love Blockchain can’t cover your trail, the people will find out. They really think that they can fool everyone lol. 
Thank you for this.
The theory that btc is being pumped by tether is flawed. Most of that pump was propped up by the Korean exchanges like Bithumb and they don't use USDT otherwise i would be doing arbitrage trading that shit.
Anyone foolish enough to sell Crypto assets for tether... well, hopefully they are quick when the music stops.
nothing, but yet, they haven't done it yet
I think it's pretty obvious that you need to prepare for that scenario, even if you don't get out entirely, understand the risks and have a plan.
"> What's the main usecase for tether?

a way to pretend you ahve money because they got shut down but 1 or 2 international banks and were unable to give people money. So *if* they made this up and used anohter exhance they were 'in' with then they could just start cooking up the price, perhaps they got really scared of something in the last 5 months which caused them to ramp up their efforts"
"In ~~their~~ a bank account, as a ""collateral"" to tethers.

Maybe Tethers are, amongst other things, a simple tool to provide a legitimate use to dirty money."
I had no clue this was possible with Btc. Where can call options be made? 
Can you explain exactly how to execute your 2nd choice? After i have fiat in coinbase where can i buy those call options?

"> One of Tether's proposed uses from its own website is to enhance arbitrage trading.

You should check out the guy @ https://twitter.com/bitfinexed, he has the exec team on the record (phone calls, podcasts, forum posts) endorsing ponzi schemes and wash trading before Bitfinex was big. "
"Sure. A BTC collapse is certainly not guaranteed. Right now it is the dominant cryptocurrency and has a huge amount of money in it. However the technology is outdated, and the core developers seem to be having trouble coming to a consensus on how to move forward. This exact dilemma is how Bitcoin Cash was created. 

Right now in BTC world, there is a lot of FOMO going on. Newbies who believe Bitcoin will make them rich. If BTC can adopt and overcome its obstacles, it sure may in fact make them rich. If it can’t, eventually people will realize that it is useless as a currency, and the bubble will pop. 

Couple that with the strange tether situation, and you have a currency with a very unknown future. "
People have the collective memory of a goldfish. The crypto market will suffer, maybe for years, but the technology is useful, so it'll come roaring back. 
That’s a disturbing prospect, for sure. But I’d argue that the masses can be brought back. Look at the collapse of Mt.Gox. That was much earlier, sure, but we’re still very early in the grand scheme of things. 
That's gotta be a lie that coinmarketcap is complicit in.  All Bitfinex USD are USDT.
Did he not trace the tethers in this OP?
Bingo.
It seems the only ones hurt in that case is anyone that accepts usdt for bitcoin. If usdt can be easily faked, than just don't accept it and you'd be fine.
My mind just inverted wow
Exactly. I'm not sure what everyone is freaking out about. This is exactly how financial systems work. Someone smart figured out how to print money and sell it for another asset, like cash.
"That's what I was thinking, blockchain's are audit-able.
"
All I'm pointing to is that ***the way Tether works is already shady enough.*** Anything beyond that is just worse.
You'd have to be a damn fool to think banks have not always been manipulating markets like that. The current stock market bubble is also fueled by cheap fiat loans and corporate welfare like QE.
"I guess it theoretically could be but a few reasons why I don't think that it is.

1. The CME index is based on GDAX, Bitstamp, Kraken, itBit. I would think those are the exchanges where they would try and mess with the price. It looks like this is already happening with GDAX as their 24hr volume has gone up almost 300% recently.

2. This activity has been going on for some time"
"First I just want to say I admire you looking into this. My comments are not meant to belittle the work you've done. Very few people actually take the time to look into this even though its all publicly available so I admire anyone who has taken on that task. This space needs more people who instead of reading reddit posts actually do their own research.

>It can't be a Bittrex deposit address, because it proceeds to send Tether to Bittrex. Plus, why would the Bittrex wallet send Tether to the Poloniex-B cold wallet?

I'm not sure I follow you here. This wallet sending money to Bittrex is precisely why I think it is a deposit address on Bittrex. A Bittrex deposit address would always receive Tether and the automatically forward it to the Bittrex hot wallet which is exactly what this address does. As far as who's is it, again, I think this address belongs to a miner, but the explanation for why is longer than this post is intended for.


Bittrex sending money to the Poloniex wallet as you outlined in this transaction

seems to me like standard testing across exchanges. If you have other transaction examples I would love to see them and perhaps change my opinion after looking through them."
"Lets follow that logic.

Blockstream is pushing for lightning.
Blockstream is run by big banks.
Big banks know and love debt instruments.

LOL"
"What? Lightning isn't a coin/token/currency. Lightning is a network of BTC transactions made of BTCs. You only ""owe"" the blockchain that which has been cryptographically commited to the network."
"I’m sorry, but I really thinking the odds of Tether being an honest and legit company are incredibly low. It would be so easy for them to produce an audit and put all our concerns to rest. I totally believe this much money could actually be flowing into cryptocurrencies, but if it were it would be easy for them to prove. 

I’m really afraid for the market when bitfinex and tether collapse. I think it’s likely to take out poloniex and Bittrex and any exchanges that have tether too. "
But I don't see anything shady about it.  The only thing that would be shady is if the bank balance they show is fake or doesn't match up with net deposits and the guys walk away with the USD, which is always a possibility. People are paying for convenience with risk.
"Well done to both of you.

As much as everyone should do research, we can't all do it for an array of reasons.

 I'm glad people like both of you exist and I really appreciate the effort you've put in to sharing your knowledge, understanding, questions and research for public view and critique. I've learnt from both of you and just wanted you to know that."
"Hold on... for real? You can only withdraw Tether from Bitfinex? 

If you think this to the logical next steps. A lot of people think they are super rich, cash out at some point on Bitfinex and withdraw their Tether to exchanges like (for example) Kraken which allows FIAT withdraws & accepts Tether. How is kraken going to be able to handle all these withdraws that came from a currency with no prove of ""1$"" value?

All these exchanges will run dry on FIAT money and run into serious Banking problems. Unlike Mt. Gox this could result into a cascading effecting much more exchanges then just one which is the root of the scam.

How endlessly naive are people... This pyramid scam can just be held alive as long as there is more FIAT money flowing into these exchanges. Once we get into the ""Cash out"" period and people start taking profits out of the exchanges, the cascading could start. Good Luck finding investors for 1 Billion $ worth of Tether just to keep the system running while there are lawsuits everywhere..."
Ugh I hope not, man. Your comment made my stomach drop. All I want is for them to say what's up. I'll even edit their explanation into my post above everything.
Thank you. I've tried to update it with some basic info. But I doubt I did it justice. If anyone wants to provide other essential (concise) details, I will gladly add it.
[This rBitcoin comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6xv1w3/whats_the_scam_with_tethers_everyones_talking/dmjet2q/) is pretty good
"Let me help you out.  Tether got started as being connected to a bank in Taiwan.  Supposedly every digital tether they created was directly tied to that bank. In theory you could walk to that bank in Taiwan and give them a tether and they'd give you a US dollar.  Unfortunately that not how banking works.  Tether could probably give you small amounts of it's currency but if a big holder flew to Taiwan and asked for a million or billion dollars the bank would laugh and say who the fuck are you and what the fuck is a 'Tether'.  So people are trading between BTC and USD on these exchanges thinking they are safe when the reality is that the USD that are using is USDT which is backed up by absolutely nothing. 

Let's say you own a 100 bitcoins and you trade them all to tether to ride out a big dip in BTC.  If that exchange fails before you can buy BTC and put it in a cold wallet you are FUCKED out of 100 Bitcoins.  Does this make sense at all?"
Came from /r/all, can confirm had no idea what it was. Reading some summary comments, I conclude that it's a currency created to be able to buy another currency.
It will be bad but not terminal. So maybe it needs to happen sooner. If this carries on they will just issue more and more and when it does go bang it will be worse. And the longer it carries on the worse it will be. So I hope they go down asap and hopefully this won't be repeated.
Well, to the tune of $1 billion dollars, which isn't much compared to the size of the $400 billion market. However, if $1 billion disappears, that will scare the market, probably causing a flight of capital. 
I don't know what that is for, just a simple observation from the chain on how very-high-amount addresses are interacting with bitfinex. Interpret however you see fit. 
https://twitter.com/bitfinexed
That should totally be illegal. Why don’t they simply call it USDT instead? This seems to be blatantly deceptive.
Yeah I remember them losing the bank, but never saying anything about getting a new bank
Lol, im new to this, this helped a lot.
I hope it all does go to shit so regulations are put in place across the board. It’s getting out of hand,
So... exactly what bitcoin does?
tbf I'm sure the creators of bitcoin are solidly invested in their product too, so a new challenger entered the crypto currency but they are lying about their reliability? Makes me think it is an mlm scheme and they are dumping their stock as fast as possible to get other currency and then making new stock.
I missed the part where somehow USDT turn into BTC without an exchange posted. The CMC link clearly shows over half a billion Tethers traded over many exchanges. This isn't a claim like the Willy bot on mtgox, so I'm looking for more evidence. I can't believe anyone is trying to get away with anything that big without alerting the bigger exchanges.
"Even what you quoted there does not 'come to a conclusion' in the sense that it does not explicitly explain why should I be concerned by that. The main problem is that you are not explaining your assumptions and you are not explaining why the connections you are drawing matter. This means that the only people who will find this persuasive are those who already believe those connections matter, i.e. those who are already persuaded.

Maybe I just piped up in the wrong thread. Maybe this information was intended for people who already know the score about Bitfinex/Tether and it was not intended to persuade any outside observer that anything bad or risky is going on. If so, I apologise. But if your intention is to persuade people who have never heard of the Bitfinex/tether connection that something risky is going on, then you need to follow up every connection or set of connections you draw with a direct explanation of why those connections *matter*. And then you need to repeat that explanation after drawing the next set of connections, and then again after the next set of connections, and so on. Repetition of the fundamental argument you are making is very effective to include after each new section of evidence. In this way, you can turn a bunch of impenetrable data into a persuasive argument that might actually work on people who were not already convinced that something shady is going on.

As it stands right now, I could not usefully present this information to anyone who did not already believe that tether is a scam. I appreciate that you put in a lot of effort though, and I don't mean to spit at that. In the end I am just some guy with opinions on how to effectively present evidence."
Explain why before the mini-correction of btc bithumb and coinome had btc at 20k while all the other exchanges were at 17k.
Why does the Kraken peg float so close to 1:1?
Hey OP, Bitfinex treats USDT and USD interchangeably. Presumably there is a small % of VIPs who can deposit or withdraw USD, but ordinary users can only withdraw USDT or crypto. It's USD ticker is in practice fraudulent.
So um, if my friend wanted to bet against tether somehow, or bet on its eventual crash, how could my friend do so.
/u/spez is a pro-censorship piece of shit, Reddit admins are content with their site being a manipulated rathole. 
From /r/all, hello!
"Yes, and Bitcoin is intrinically linked to 100s of other currencies as well.

If BTC goes down, we all go down. The scary part his, I don't think there really is any ""safe"" space to go to really. I trust fiat even less than Tether. I can only hope ETH/BCH become the trusted pairs that will catch the capital flight.

"
"I think the worst-case scenario is much worse than that. This is a pretty concerning indication that a major cryptocurrency exchange is insolvent. If it goes under (and that looks like a real possibility), it's probably not going to be good for the entire market.

Look at /r/bitfinex - people complaining they can't cash out and that their balances are being mysteriously reduced.

This is red flag city here. 

My guess (and I'm just some guy on the Internet, this does not constitute financial advice, please do your own research, some restrictions apply, offer only good at participating Taco Bell locations, etc.) is that Bitfinex is discovered to be insolvent and the crypto market crashes hard, then slowly recovers."
"**TL;DR** - Tether *(Tether Limited / Tether Holdings Limited)*, in partnership with Bitfinex *(BFXNA Inc. / iFinex Inc.)* is the sole user and trader of USDT across at least 3 major crypto exchanges (Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex), controlling over 73% of USDT in circulation--623,000,000 of the total 844,000,000. While ~66% of USDT daily trade volume is on the BTC/USDT pair, USDT also happens to make up between 6% & 17% or more of daily BTC trading volume.

&nbsp;

**ELI5:** Some random guy is writing numbers on a paper, and calling it money. He's telling everyone in town that it's money, even though it's not. It has become so trusted by the town, that banks have started accepting it for real money. This random guy who is scribbling numbers on paper to make his fake money, also controls 3/4 of its entire supply, which he has distributed across 3 separate banks. Now, almost 1/5 of all money transacted in the banks, is transacted in this random guy's fake money."

TLDR: FUD
There's this one, but it only goes to November 13th from November 3rd. https://enucatl.github.io/usdt-forensics/ Other than that, I don't know of one :(
It boils down to a 3rd party inventing a currency they can summon at-will without proof of reserves, then turn around and use it in cryptocurrency trading. They *say* it's backed 1:1 by USD, but so far have offered no proof of the claim.
In before the gold train starts 
Evidence of what? I haven't made claims yet regarding the trading of BTC/USDT. How does one even link to individual BTC/USDT trades? Unless you're referring to the 24hr trading volume, which is public knowledge and can can be found on [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#markets).

If you make a ton of fake money and use it to make a real profit, and then all that fake money goes away, what are you left with? Profit. They aren't affected by this.
yeah, and the response was, well different than i would have expected a real theft thing to be
Not true, only takes a very small amount of liquidity to move a market, especially if you throw some leverage into the mix.
"Thats what they mean Bitcoin has become a ponzi scheme by certain exchanges. The general public are not aware of the criminality involved in crypto manipulation. Crypto has many bad actors and many are going to be burnt once it all comes to a head. 

Those on the inside running the show know exactly when its all going to blow up but as long as they have new fresh money coming in it keeps the show rolling for the time being.

My fear is that with many that are going to be affected by the eventual collapse. Government regulation will kick in even harder. I also see many people involved  are going to be eventually tracked down by law enforement and end up in prison for a very long time. "
Thank you for that :)
I found it there
I hope it doesn't either, friend. It may not, who knows. 
Yes.  But if the exchange folds up they will just fold and nobody is cashing anything out.
‘Reddit’ hasn’t officially responded but in the comments section of that post a mod from r/bitcoin has refuted the claims.

The most hilarious thing on this link are the Yahoos commenting after the story with no idea whatsoever, bashing bitcoin and crypto with so much FUD, an amusing aperitif after the read...
No. Holding both is not the most sane. You're holding a good crypto and a dog shit. If you want to diversify, do it with other good cryptos.
I find that hate spouting zelots who say demonstrably untrue things are usually right. /s

"There is not much that can be done. They had to take the funds from a bunch of addresses due to them either being generated from an old algorithm, or because the address was reused (which can be exploited). If they had not done this, then it's possible some hacker would've stolen the funds first. They have been holding the tokens for more than a month.

- Not guaranteed to be able to sell online getting fiat money! 

- Will increase in price forever! 

- To be extra safe only ever buy Bitcoin with other crypto!

Use tabs https://youtu.be/aUgL-4fx2JE (Adam's tabs)
The future is here! But seriously, try convincing any rational person that BTC could work as a currency or payment settlement method. If my tech/computer-illiterate parents understood that no one would use Crypto if the fees were too high, I have no clue what kind of kool-aid the are drinking on the other sub. This only give a really bad look on crypto in general for the majority of the population and articles are starting to pop-up saying that BTC is actually useless. 
I made a transaction 48 hours ago to send from my wallet into an exchange to sell, it's still stuck in the mempool and I have no way to get it out. I have no idea how this is valued so high if people can't even get transactions completed. I looked at a 'transaction accelerator' service and they want a ridiculous $150 USD to push my transaction to the top of the line.

Why are you still holding bitcoin if you hate it so much? 
When will people get that BTC popularity makes it illiquid and that it should be treated as such?
"I don't know why they ruled miners are not money transmitters, the answer is probably [here](https://coincenter.org/entry/aml-kyc-tokens), until I read that I would guess:

Miners don't act as a conduit for money, miners only testify to the order that existing transactions happened. The miner is not a participant in the transaction - see why FinCEN considered Mike Cadwell a money transmitter (in my link in previous comment) while ignoring others who used Bitcoin: he was accepting Bitcoin from one source and sending it to a second person who might potentially be different from the first source. Mike was effectively a conduit for money between the two people, which miners are not.

When you make a bitcoin transaction with someone, it's p2p - nobody takes your money to give to the other guy, you build your transaction together and sign it, you later publish that transaction to the network."
That sorta makes sense, but i'm hung up on why a LN node would be a money transmitter, but a regular Bitcoin node wouldn't?  I know you aren't FinCEN but it seems odd.
Right but the nodes are relaying transactions and keeping track of everything, I could see them come under scrutiny at some point. 
"LN will naturally form into a topology of massive centralised hubs, onto which you will open your payment channels, those hubs need to be licensed by FinCEN because an LN node is what the law calls a money transmitter*, which means the hubs will behave the same way as banks - wanting to know who their customers are and keeping an eye out for suspicious payments, placing embargos like Visa etc did with Wikileaks. You'll still be able to close a channel you have with a hub and recover the bitcoin, minus the enormous fees for that mainchain transactions are intended to have.

Basically LN is recreating the existing banking network.

The topology will favor massive central hubs because of the large parked capital requirements, the money transmitter license requirements, and (if I understand correctly, which I might not) LN's lack of ability to route well over long routes.

\* FinCEN hasn't said anything about Lightning Network yet, I'm basing this on [previous related rulings](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gxkvj/lightning_hubs_will_need_to_report_to_irs/dqmwb6e/)."
"What deal? Some shady blog post from 2016 written by one guy? There are no official statements concerning a partnership with any big companies. Nothing. It's all fake in my eyes. A blog post doesn't count as an official statement.

Check Google for ""sbibits Bitcoin cash"". THIS is a real statement from 2 companies going into a partnership. Nothing official has come from Microsoft or Samsung or VW."
Try using a 10 cent fee on both chains and see which one is faster.
"How can the payment routes be blocked?  Wouldn't any blocking also be applicable to traditional bitcoin network/blockchain as well?

Not trolling, genuinely asking.  Thanks in advance for not downvoting me for asking questions."
Thanks for the points.  What about their deal with Microsoft now? Or is that a scam?
Well that's the thing. If people are honest, 90% of the BCH fans want to gain as much as the BTC hodlers and they don't actually care to spend their BCHs, they just want to gain more.
If you want a government regulated payment layer where every node qualifies as a money transmitter and your payment routes can be conventionally blocked, sure, it's not long to wait, but I think you're gonna be waiting much much longer.
Yeah that's the thing though.  People can't move their BTC right now. so a BCH/pair exchange is basically useless.  We need an exchange that offers BCH for USD sales.
[deleted]
Even if bitcoin were to succeed in a few years as a so called store-of-value only, complete with a fully functioning Lightning Network, people still need a functional bitcoin now, today, just to trade with. Cryptocurrencies and tokens are a blossoming market (as 2017 has shown)- a new asset class actually, and it is ridiculous to think the market should or will wait year(s) for Bitcoin to become usable, or that if another coin does take its place for this purpose (which Core advocates have actually recommended), that that coin won't become, itself, a better store of value.
Pretty much. Especially when you consider it requires an on chain transaction to open the channel anyway...why not just pay the merchant with the on chain transaction. An extra step and an extra cost, that there is no reason for anyone to incur. 
"There are ways I can imagine Lightning Network working out, for example non-profit hobby nodes that are not run as part of a business won't be considered money transmitters, so if enough individuals could open lots of payment channels on their nodes and if Lightning could route well over lots of lowly-interconnected nodes then it could work.

One of the things preventing people from opening lots of payment channels with friends etc (instead of just a couple on mega-hubs that do everything) will be the high Bitcoin fees for the main-chain. People are now talking about the need for a third scaling layer in the middle - in order to allow people to open and close channels with less cost, if they managed to pull that off then Lightning might decentralize to the point where regulation and censorship is pointless.

Though then you have a 3rd layer of complication, learning curve, and user-unfriendliness.

So it might work, and I don't have a crystal ball, but there's an awful lot of ""ifs"" to be betting the whole future of the coin on it, which is what the small-block approach is doing."
"Voorhees frames the issue as a mere scaling ""debate"" in order to avoid addressing the deeper problems with Bitcoin."
I'd dearly hope so, but I think it'd be better the blocksize debate be settled permanently before they come crawling back.
Why would they stop supporting Core, their business and the value they provide to the ecosystem is that they allow you to convert one crypto to another. What would be the use for ShapeShift if they only supported one coin even if it is the best coin.
I doubt that will work as well as attacking Roger (who loses his calm) or CSW (who is a fraud). His business is a good service, what are they gonna say?
i didn't say they did.  what i do say is that his refusal to take a stand against core dev given all the info we've accumulated makes him a non-libertarian.  sometimes you just have to speak up for what you think is right.
"I look at it this way.

If you showed up into the market today, knowing everything you know, how would you allocate your cryptoportfolio to maximize long term profits based on the expected long term prospects of the coins?

Then allocate your portfolio like that."
Me too. I'm willing to admit that we all could be wrong and that the ultimate result might be the survival of both btc and BCH, although I'm a maximalist that thinks only one will ultimately survive, that being BCH. But hey, there's a shit ton of fiat floating around that simply wants a SOV which may end up being stored in btc over the long term. That'd be highly disappointing to me. 
"> I don't have the balls to convert all my BTC to BCH now 

I understand you, and felt the same until this week. Holding equivalent nominal balances on both. But this doesn't make sense anymore.

Do you actually see BTC going that much far, the way it is? It doesn't work. I had to pay over 50$ in fees in total to pass a transaction with many inputs (not that many TBH, under 10) the other day. I had a friend calling me trying to help him out with his important transaction that wouldn't confirm, even though he had put ""high priority"" in his Ledger. This shit is broken, with no prospect of an acceptable fix. Oh, and historically there are always strong crashes after strong rises, like the one we've seen this year. Check how the mempool got these late days with the increase in price (fast moves in price generates more transactions). A fast decrease in price would be much worse since [transactions would be larger](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gg2ph/why_you_wont_be_able_to_sell_your_segwitcoins/) and hashpower would go away. If we see a correction of the likes we've seen in 2013, congestion could be so epic it could effectively kill BTC.

Meanwhile BCH infrastructure is growing faster than any other coin. I expect Coinbase to open direct trading of it soon. Roger Ver was talking about a place to buy with credit card - tough, but if he pulls that out, the only thing we'd be missing are debit cards to spend - and TBH not even BTC is good on that front anymore, since Visa and Mastercard are basically blocking everyone living outside of the EU from having one of those cards.

I understand moving significant amounts of money is always delicate, but this week I converted a good chunk of my old BTC into BCH. I still own more BTC than BCH in market value, basically because its value is so much higher. But I'm already converting, slowly. I do intend to eventually own more BCH than BTC in market value. I'd also like to diversify to ETH, but I understand so little of it yet that I need to learn more."
that there is an active demonstration that he doesn't understand what is going on and is willing to tolerate the tactics of r/bitcoin.
How do you explain the half hour waiting and the 60$ fee for converting LTC to DASH then?
Makes a lot more sense. 
Erik is the middle man
I think I would. If we ever get to that 8mb, those idiots will be so happy they'll be BCH pumpers by that point. 
oh... duh. Thanks.
Yes, he trades the 'Non-Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash' coin, BCore's Segwit altcoin. 
It makes perfect sense when you look at how Erik used to behave. 
">r/bitcoin saying dont use shapeshift? or worse?

This is exactly it imo. "
If they were to stop supporting core, I assume.
If he choses a side, people will retaliate and boycot/slander/attack his business. 
"u/Eirenarch, you've received `0.001 BCH ($1.37 USD)`!

Long term highest amount of value being transacted on it's block chain, largest user base, highest adoption.  The coin with all those things will naturally also have the highest price.
His portfolio allocations have nothing to do him him being libertarian
"I am a true libertarian but while I invested a sum I could afford to lose that amount of BTC increased in value to something quite significant for me. I don't have the balls to convert all my BTC to BCH now :(

at least I'm not selling for fiat I guess"
Most likely. And he calls himself an ancap.
Shapeshift needs one coin as reference for the price of the others, and they use BTC for it. Why they switch my funds first from LTC to BTC and then from BTC to DASH is something I don't understand at all. But it is my only explanation for 60$ conversion fee and half an hour waiting until it was confirmed. Because LTC and DASH have cent fees and confirmation times of seconds to minutes.
There is no BTC middle man.
What was the reason then for the high conversion fee and the half hour waiting before shapeshift confirmed my LTC to DASH change? Both coins have tx fees of a few cents, and confirmation times of no longer than 5min.
"True, but one day we're gonna have this scaling debate all over again as BCH's 8mb raising it a static increase, so miners and nodes are going to have to agree to raise the limit yet again.

Do you really want those people to have a vested interest in BCH?"
"This has been reduced to two ; btc supporter"
That could explain the 60$ fee, but not the half hour wait until the LTC DASH pair conversion was confirmed.
Actually, us true libertarians are greedy too. We think that worldwide user adoption will lead to the greatest ultimate price. 
"I agree completely that Shapeshift's fees are too high.

However, why would Shapeshift got via BTC and pay the BTC miner fees instead of just sucking up all the fees themselves? Going via BTC just does not make sense."
Yes, decentralized SoV is still a win from libertarian standpoint. It still allows people to keep their money out of government reach and avoid capital controls. That being said an actual electronic cash not controlled by government would be much bigger deal. SoV is good but we have greatly downgraded our goals if SoV is all that we want to achieve.
There is no doubt core has cost us alot of time
"The difference here is that BCH and BTC are not the only options anymore. Some of those other coins are good too and if the FUD and P.R. attacks from Core work maybe some of them will become the electronic cash standard. I will be fine with that but this is one reason I am scared to go all in on BCH
"
"Concern troll spotted.

No one can deny the amazing progress of BitcoinCash."
look deeper into the crystal ball my friend.  the circumstances are very similar to 2010-2012, imo.
It will likely affect the price of other cryptos, but not their functioning. A 70% correction on BTC price would break its network mercilessly.
Sadly I don't get the impression that we're winning :( At best it's a stalemate. Lets hope I am wrong and we see a lot of businesses and services support BCH next year.
I truly believe there will be some correction but I don't know when maybe from 100K to $30K. I also think it will affect other crypto.
"i hope you don't think i was accusing you of being a partial libertarian.  b/c i wasn't.

i too have doubts about BCH sometimes; it's only natural when you see all the BTC pumpers going full retard on the price.  makes one question what the market is telling you."
"true; for now.  BCH is only 4mo"
You really think the chance of major price correction on the next couple years is small? If you've been around here for as long as your reddit account is old, I cannot imagine how you can truly think that.
I agree but I don't think that would stop it. And there's no reason that couldn't improve. 
I disagree that something cannot be a store of value without utility.
"Of course I do. As a libertarian my point is that I am prepared to invest only a certain amount of my savings into a political cause with dubious success. I mean if there was a guarantee that BCH would become popular enough to be able to buy food at the local store with it I would donate all my savings (crypto, fiat and gold) to the cause. Now all I do is run a BCH full node, HODL the coins after the fork (which means I have some monetary investment) and argue verbally for the big blocks cause. I wish I had Roger Ver size balls but I don't. However I don't think that makes me non-libertarian.

If all crypto achieves is a decentralized SoV that is not controlled by the governments I'd still take it and celebrate it. I don't think that makes me non-libertarian either or a traitor to the electronic cash cause."
So say that I believe BTC gets its value from the option to avoid capital controls. High transaction fees do not matter for this.
All else equal this is true but capitalization and brand recognition matter a lot in this game and BTC is far stronger on this front.
No but lets say I think chances for this to happen are smaller than BTC not succeeding.
ETH still has too much central control. 
"Sov doesn't exists.

If there's no utility or economic activity besides speculation then it's a ponzi, nothing more."
One other minor point that I'm sure you already get but libertarians can also be poor with a use case capable of only p2p ecash thus making btc totally unusable for them
"How many times do we need to go through this? 

Gresham's law: Bad money drive out good money.

Bitcoin Cash is everything Bitcoin Core is PLUS a medium of exchange. 

A digital asset which lacks one of the most important aspects that makes money money (medium of exchange) will not remain money for long. 

There is no magical store of value because of scarcity or whatever lame reason people with zero economic understanding spew out. 

Bitcoin Cash is the better money and Gresham's law already shows it.. Merchants are abandoning Bitcoin Core en masse and are adopting Bitcoin Cash. 

When the speculation train runs out of steam, the whole 'store of value' will be nothing but a story of value"
Yep, and BCH is both a SOV and a p2p ecash. That's the ultimate in monetary power. 
"> For the future of BTC I actually think that BTC as a store of value only can work. It works for gold, don't see why it wouldn't for BTC.

Gold is not only a store of value. Actually, according to the World Gold Council, last year more than half of gold produced from mining or recycling went to jewelry alone, and around 7,6% of it into ""technological uses"". Investments plus central banks got around 40% of that, which is a large chunk I agree, but much smaller than the current chunk of BTC being sold to people who don't even care if it has a commercial use.

But regardless. The situation with BTC is dangerous. A severe movement of the price on a downward direction could bring an irrecoverable congestion. The only defense against that would be to have everyone onboard of their banking, I mean, lightning network before such movement happens. Seeing how much time it's taking for Segwit adoption, which is technically easier, to happen, how long until that happens with LN? Are you confident no crash will happen in the mean time?"
"Gold has a 20K history of holding value, BTC is ephemeral electronic money that could actually crash and burn.  Gold is a base element and cannot be destroyed.  Gold has many uses outside ""store of value"" which support its value proposition.  Onchain BTC has **none.**"
Absolutely.
Yep, a permanent solution like adaptive blocksizes. 
I don't think they should or would, just seems to be what people think would happen.
I'd probably bet on Ethereum to be honest.
"> although I'm a maximalist that thinks only one will ultimately survive, that being BCH

I sympathize with the ""maximalist"" idea, but, on the real long run, why BCH and not ETH? Ether does seem technically superior. If they manage to get rid of mining for PoS and that works, it will make them considerably superior - specially if they drop inflation after that, as I heard was the plan.
"
The winner will not have a 1MB block size. However, it would be unwise to count BTC out from some kind of turn-around.
"For the future of BTC I actually think that BTC as a store of value only can work. It works for gold, don't see why it wouldn't for BTC. I only changed my buying habits and started buying small amounts of ETH with the part of the money I save each month. In addition I've only went through the motions to setup a Coinbase account (and it was painful with the document scans and the requirements for 3D secure card) and they don't sell BCH directly I have to go through shapeshift which means additional taxes (I still did this to buy a small amount of Dash and EOS since I already own BCH)

BTW I wonder if /r/jobs4bitcoin will delete my post if I wanted to get paid in BCH or ETH instead of BTC.
"
Hard fork
Bitcoin was cute when it was worth a few billion. But we're talking hundreds of billions now and people are willing to go very, very far for the tiniest piece of that cake.  
"I don't think Core got to him. The guys who pay Core's payroll are in his rolodex; he wants the market to speak for him strongly so he can be a follower instead of a leader at this point."
"it can offer free and trustless and instant txs to all it's users and bitcoin legacy's users right now. when there are more users and when the technology gets better blocks will get bigger too. simple enough that even you can grasp.

FYI 0C is fine if you're not selling something to a miner or the purchase is less than $50,000 or so."
At the time there was an agreement on Segwit2X and he honored it, no need to bash him for that. 
"How exactly can Bitcoin Cash offer instant and free transactions for all of human kind in only 8 MB blocks?

Also, FYI, zero confirmation transactions are not secure. Unscrupulous miners could still offer double spend as a service."
"Why do we need BTC or BCH in the first place? We already have NAVcoin that is a fork of bitcoin that is far more advanced than BCH already and you save the environment from pointless mining that uses as much electricity as Ireland (Yes a whole country). PoS is the future. You can enjoy 30 second transaction times and low fees. 

Why are people wasting time talking about an already obsolete and outdated coin like BCH? "
It's unfortunate Roger is alive and well.
It's definitely not a debate and never has been. As soon as discussion occurred back in 2015 we were pushed out of the room into r/btc, and since then the only debates to speak of have been taking place here on r/btc.
But hey... he got his SegWit, that's something  👌
His position seems to be that he holds both and let the best coin win but he isn't going to waste his brain cells bickering about it. 
Well, one way to look at this is that his allegiance to btc and core will cost him money over the long run. 
"I don't know why they'd have to use a middle man at all. I mean, I guess it's a little easier than having to match up one-for-one but at that point, you'd want to use whichever currency had the least friction and best liquidity or perhaps take a leaf from Bitfinex's book and make your own.

Shapeshift.io is open source anyway, right? You'd think there would be more competition."
It doesn't use btc as a middle man
Well, it would be nice to shut them up and have them root for BCH. The network effect benefits from even having idiots onboard. 
"This. My respect for Roger Ver grows every day as I compare him to these slimy turn-coats like Erik Voorhees, Andreas Antonopolous, Charlie Shrem, Charlie ""SatoshiLite"" Lee, Max Keiser etc. Too many of them. This split in Bitcoin has really opened up my eyes and I'm happy for that. Nothing wrong with being greedy, but when you say one thing and do another, that's when I stop listening to you. Please dump all your BCH so we never have to deal with you again."
I've been waiting 12 hours for a shapeshift from BTC to ltc 
"3 words: segwit 2x supporter

Edit: why the downvotes? 2x isnt a word? "
"There isn't anything wrong with it in the same sense that there isn't anything wrong with crony capitalism. 

Apparently, formation of a political class which employs online attacks, censorship, threats and intimidation in order to herd what they think is clueless masses, and their use of manufactured ever changing cardboard enemies and idolized personalities, do not call for a ""shrug"", according to some of our Bitcoin libertarians.

Who is John Galt? A fictional hero.
"
It's not that bad of a reply. Basically just saying he's got both. I do as well but way more bullish on bch, since the tech is better etc. 
That’s funny because he honestly looks like a eunuch in that photo. 
What is HF?
"Core got to him long ago. 

This space as a whole is infected with fear. "
Erik is an altcoin trader . His allegiance is to the coins he adds on shapeshift which includes bitcoin , bcash and all other alts he deals with so Roger's question didn't make any sense
If he chooses a side, he l (ShapeShift) loses. By sitting it out he profits the most. Letting the market decide between Core and Cash also isn’t totally weird. It’s just not a totally honest fight. And the fight itself sets crypto currencies back years. But, water under de bridge. 🤷🏻‍♂️
He was a fool for selling his BCH after the fork and believing in the 2x increase but I still respect him. He did support a HF away from core, the one everyone agreed upon (Segwit2X). After that failed he bought back his BCH and now he owns both coins. So lets not call him names, but instead make BCH the best coin out there. Our goal isn’t to get Voorhees in our camp, our goal is to get *everyone* using Bitcoin Cash. 
My thoughts exactly.  I thought he had more integrity.  He could have really helped make a difference.
Our (big blockers) side should stop insulting people especially those who are kind of neutral.
in the first place there was no bitcoin, so it was made. then if there is bitcoin what's the point of opther coins?

yep.  really curious to know what he is afraid of if he supports bitcoin cash. r/bitcoin saying dont use shapeshift?  or worse?
"Meanwhile, on shapeshift's homepage:
""The Ethereum and Bitcoin networks are currently experiencing significant congestion. Transactions may be delayed for hours.""

I fail to see how ShapeShift loses. Care to explain?

"/u/evoorhees said that he would support a HF away from Core if Core didn't provide a block size increase; now instead he says he's through with the debate forever.

What a pussy."
">I did support a HF (SegWit2x). It succeeded in activating SegWit but failed to achieve enough consensus for the HF to 2MB blocks. I own both BTC and BCH now, and am done with the scaling debate forever.

Rip Erik, grow a pair bud"
Erik doesn't give a shit. He's an opportunist. He makes money from people trading between coins. Not saying there's anything wrong with this.
That's a fair criticism. /u/tippr .001 bch
"I don't understand how do you define ""win""?  "
Then he isn't a true libertarian. Sorry. 
Personally, I'd rather the people that helped destroy legacy Bitcoin in the first place, NOT join us. Please leave them be on their rickety, leaky 1mb raft.
"Agreed, they don't want to talk about it, they just want to bend us over, get the broom handle all lubed up, and them sweep us right out the door.

We create our own coin and all of a sudden we hijack the name (uhhh, you gave them the right to the name considering they didn't create BTC or it's tech) they've now turned it to Segwit coin, which is completely different than the original WP, and yet they still think they own the name.

I love how they think this is a dictatorship, like no dude. Economics either work or they don't, once people realize they can't spend their store of value or digital gold anywhere.... why bother even own it? The answer is because it's unregulated, which will change IF LN is released, which I still suspect it never will be. They basically admitted it's in prealpha like a week ago. That's pathetic, if anything will save the original BTC, it's clearing the mempool and reducing fees, but they won't, they've proven it time and time again.

My favorite (YES FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY) is checking my investment daily for it to finally take over. I seem to remember this giddy feeling, and I'm not scared AT ALL of dropping from $1400 to $1175 Because I haven't had faith in BTC for a long time but I do have faith in BCH, as a superior method to replace worthless paper USD. Why would I ever need a store of value when I can't use it, where does it get it's value then?, that's like..... owning gold if it was unregulated. Go ahead and try to pay for gas with a chunk of gold. Whereas go ahead and pay for gas with BCH, one seems way more practical....."
Yes!!!!!!!
"I stopped using shapeshift because of their policy to still stick to BTC as a 'middle man' when shifting funds from one coin to another. The fees just made me vomit. 60$ for switching from litecoin to dash for example, and it still took half an hour to be processed.

As soon as Shapeshift uses BCH as the 'middle man', I'll be back in instantly."
"Interestingly I have both observed and participated in actual technical scaling debate. I have never ever seen the big blocker side lose the technical argument including when I myself argued with people that obviously read more about the issue (I had to keep reading their links while arguing). In the end the small blockers always declare ""but this is not a technical debate anyway"". Fuck them! If it is not technical debate then admit that technically big blocks are fine.
"
"Yes, and I remember the 'Scaling Bitcoin' meetups where talk about scaling was prohibited.

Makes for a productive debate. /s"
Did he sell all his BCH as promised? 
No, ledger nano S.  That thing does almost all the coins as well as SEGWIT.
I wish it would've went through.  That would've been a good thing and support the price as well as dampen some of the liquidity.

"I'm not getting into a long debate with you. I will say though, this argument that BCH is this widely accepted currency by merchants is just absurb. Last 24 hours, BCH's # of unique transactions is ~24k, LTC's is ~76k, Bitcoin is ~400k, Ethereum is ~760k. Hell, even Eth Classic has done ~49k unique transactions. BCH has close to the same number of unique transactions as Dogecoin's ~20k. And you can't just throw out ""name ten alts than x"" because my point is at least one alt does everything you listed better, which severely diminishes BCH's potential impact."
"Nothing in that explain how high fees somehow make BTC superior.

BTC is competiting against no one simply **because it cannot compete.** merchants are all dropping BTC.

This is not an advantage this is (huge) liability."
I'm suggesting that bitcoin isn't only a currency, whereas BCH has pigeonholed itself to only be superior to bitcoin as a currency. Every other alt in the world has noticed this,  its not like BCH has stumpbled upon some huge secret. You are competing against 1000+ altcoins, Bitcoin is competing against no one.
And you are absolutely right about that. IOTA is just another centralized scam. It's a shame seeing it in the top ten.
"Every point you just raised I could easily come up with a non-bitcoin alt (let alone bitcoin) that does those things better than BCH. Not a great response.

Just a quick aside: BCH's ""market cap"" is bullshit, and if you take that seriously you can't be considered a educated person in this debate. Why don't you see how many BCH coins are actually in circulation since the fork?"
[deleted]
"Ignore my post eh? You respond to mine than I'll take the time to do the same. Renounce BTH as being ""more widely accepted"" than other alts since it's a false claim that gets propagated around this subreddit daily."
