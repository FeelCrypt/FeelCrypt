Id expect that but they havnt said theyd trade it did they? Id expect they would only because anyone who wasnt smart enough to get it off before the fork may not be capable of claiming it and sending it off coinbase in Jamuary

"The API permission has wallet:buys:create in there, which is needed to create a buy order by API. I was surprised to see that, because I thought Coinbase would only allow sell orders too.

Sure, the API permission might be for technical reasons only, but it might also mean support for buy orders coming sooner or later."

How can you be a member of the Bitcoin community and not know what Shapeshift is? Shapeshift.io? Idk why my comment is downvoted but it's the simplest way to obtain BCH for a beginner.
Bitcoin Cash is offered on Shape Shift.
lol : ) 
I think you’re right, but I think it also has to do with the fact that it’s available on Coinbase. I can’t tell you how many people I know who know nothing about crypto but are investing in what’s on Coinbase because they can figure it out.
/u/tippr $10
Taking that hunch back to notre dame 👍🏼
Just click it and see for Christ's sake, some exchanges are still using the old ticker
You're being dramatic
At Binance I believe it is crypto only.  If you are looking to get/send fiat then they are not for you.
I agree to an extent however there will be a lot of public money thinking 'this could be like buying BTC at $1800' as well....only time will tell.
"I think because of that it is super important that we consistently change the appearance of BitcoinCash to green so that it can be distinguished by every user. We visually just look the same as BTC

Thanks for the info. Seems like every exchange has issues. So far so good on Poloniex for me.
I meant, I cant exchange fiat into crypto, right?
Lol ok I will no longer form a hunch in my life ever again 
Bitcoin Connect is not Bitcoin Cash
2018 bits /u/tippr
$BCH pls
Yeah as they were working on ETC it decayed to near-0 volume.  Conversely, bcc volume up 600% since that announcement was made.  The context is key to making good business decisions about what the tech team should build.
Can you withdraw from them? I thought i read people were having trouble withdrawing but they might not have been verified
"https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=BCC_BTC

"
Coinbase said many alts to come in 2018 as long as those projects are compatible and meet checklist of requirements. They also state they list coins that are in user demand. Also a reason SegWit is slow to be added, not as much demand. So yes, BCH.
Thanks guys for the explanation
That's correct, editing my comment.
"Yes.  Symbol is BCC (not BCH).
"
Yes, as far as I can tell.  I'm not looking at cryptos because I want US dollars or euros or anything else.  It's just monopoly game money to me.
what i do is purchase ethereum on gemini and then send it to bittrex to trade other cryptos
I use it on the recommendation of someone else. What's wrong with it?
Very true. I have told and informed many people online and close personal friends/relatives. They fully understand how LN is a scam, segwit is a scam, and how having 20 to 50USD fees is unsustainable for BTC to actually hold value in most people's eyes. Once fees start getting into 50 to 100 USD + consistently, most normies won't want it.
I know nothing, but I believe people will sell it off. Price will then tank, and slowly build up again.
Go to coin market cap.com, type in BCH, click on “markets“, and you will see the exchanges where it can be purchased with BTC. No idea what that other guys talking about with shape shifting.
With fiat you can use bitstamp.net, until the end of this month they are offering BCH trading pairs without the trading commission, zero commission.
Local bitcoins cash by mail trade, then do shapeshift BTC to BCH.
He’s joking down voters lol
Lol
[deleted]
"Is this because BCH seems more likely to be 'spendable'?  BTC not only has its issue of being a 'store of value' as so many have said, but it is really not as acceptable to spend as BCH.  BCH currently makes the better currency.
"
I don't know, i was just saying that one way was open while the other one isn't. There is no reason in discussing it anyway as we'll just see in a few days what happens.
"you're basing ""pretty likely"" off a hunch :\"
"Wrong. Alts all have one common characteristic. They explicitly do not share any transaction history with Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit on the other hand are both Bitcoin fork-coins. "
"> Hard to say, there may be just as many people, or more, clamoring to buy.

LTC has proven that statement to be 100 percent accurate. In fact anything coinbase adds to the site over the next 6 to 12 months, will probably shoot up in value. Simply because it’s there, and grandma and grandpa are as well."
I think it’s pretty likely they’re adding it to the exchange to buy.
[deleted]
And who would buy then? Coinbase is just going to take the coins right back and fork over many millions of dollars for the privilege? Highly unlikely.
What? How can you sell it if there's no one buying? Do you mean that they just let you extract it to another wallet?
If there is peoplw buying LTC, there will be people buying BCH. 
I for one own no bch but it has a more significant space in my mindset than btc atm.  I just am too unfortunate to have any money to invest :(
"Think about it. How did you hear about Bitcoin? Somebody told you about it. And they heard about it from someone before them, who heard about it from someone else before them. 

All these people were spreading the same message: ""Bitcoin is the future of money. It's what we will all be using some day.""

The people who really believe and understand why that message is true are all now telling everyone they know that Bitcoin Cash is the version of Bitcoin that will get us there. "
"> What makes you think people will be clamouring to buy?

If people want a bitcoin they can actually transact with swiftly."
Bch volume up 600% in 3 months
To sell something requires a buyer 😂
Why...? Because it is the one opportunity new entrants into the crypto world get to go back in time and buy bitcoin at a low low price and in less than 2 yrs BCH will reach BTC Prices and higher
What a guy!
No.  Ownership of BTC on Jan 1 does *not* mean you are awarded BCH.  The August 1 hard fork date, and specifically ownership of BTC prior to the actual forked block entitle BTC holders to BCH 1:1.  The significance of early January is that Coinbase is expected to release the BCH to which certain account holders were entitled dating back to the August 1 fork.  What we are *hoping* is that Coinbase will add BCH functionality so that account holders can trade it and hold accounts on their site, as they have done already for ETH and LTC.  (But to date Coinbase has not announced they are doing that, at least not that I have seen yet).
the shapeshift fee is only a miner fee from my experience using it. If they did take any kind of fee out I don't see it. 
"Read the comment again. Local bitcoins cash by mail trade. Cash by mail. You find a trader with good feedback and you send them cash in the mail. You get bitcoins within 2-3 days.

Exchanges can take weeks to get verified on, and often aren't convenient at all. You can also use local bitcoins to go to a physical bank and do a cash deposit and get your BTC within an hour.

I don't know of any other way to get Bitcoins that fast due to all the verification processes."

Omg thank you so much. I just recently sold all my crypto to help pay the bills but I honeslty plan to hold onto this for a significant period if time. 
Fir me its fast and cheap. Strong community. The slow growth is to me healthier than things rocketing and users have stilp stuck by it.

"Litecoin is my favorite coin as well, but if asked, I could not really say why.  The way the transactions work perhaps.

I agree.   I really like the idea of BCH and the low fees, but the brand piracy is a drawback if Joe Everyman is going to be using the stuff to buy his beer and football tickets.   The green color is a decent start, but it would be great if there was some kind of unique identifier.   
"and the unitary price being so much less than BTC will make it seem a ""bargain"" on a merely visual level."
"I absolutely agree.  Everything is way too similar currently.  BCH and BTC is easy to confuse.  The name is easy to confuse.  At least the logo should be different.  I think green works well to fit the 'cash' theme, and it makes sense if Bitcoin is 'gold'.
"
Also dumping it. Will be very interesting to see which side has heavier action. Get the popcorn
We should be telling them they're right!
Has much credibility as someone having a hunch that the new star wars movie will immediately show episode 9 right after this one. Glad you are putting your opinions out there bro. 
Would love to read some good resources you have on why LN is a scam. It sounds like a good solution but something in my gut makes me feel like it won't be enough to solve BTC's issue.
"There's something to be said for security. There is a far greater investment in infrastructure for securing BCH than any of these coins you mentioned. 

I'll say the same thing I've always said about alts. They are great testbeds and proving grounds. If they really come up with something great, it can be integrated into Bitcoin (either one)."
"I disagree. Bitcoin Cash will support zero-conf. You can't actually beat instant.

In the next 18 months we are likely to see a 5-10x reduction in BCH confirmations and /or a push to weak blocks either of which will give BCH ""much better than good enough"" performance vs any peers."
"I didn’t say I don’t know what it is. I said I don’t know what that suggestion is all about. 

You basically gave him the most complicated solution possible. You really want him to go meet someone in an alley from local bitcoins, or deal with all that nonsense plus surplus fees? Then shapeshift some nonsense?

Yes this is exactly why.  Its closer to what the whitepaper describes,  p2p cash not gold

Everyone who really wants to buy can do it since 1. aug, they just have to use an other exchange. But selling was not possible for coinbase users.

That's one of the big benefits of Bitcoin cash compared to other altcoins, it's easy to support if you already have BTC support
"Shouldn’t that image of ETC indicate that these could be fakes? Kind of like what happened a couple days ago when people started sharing a fake image with XRP and XMR on the Coinbase API?

Edit: Some other people confirming it’s real, but why ETC then? I would have never expected that they would consider to add it (unless only the ETC picture is the fake).

Edit 2: just realized this is from 5 months ago - I guess the difference would be that ETC didn’t get demand, whereas BCH did and does."
GDAX when??
This is whay bittrex said was going to be the case with bitcoin gold snd they wound up trading it
Agreed- it just seems like a wasted opportunity for them to give their customers BCH and not support it. I was thinking that earlier today.

I keep emailing them about first blood but they don't listen :/
I think they're going to wait until the next update regarding the address uniformity, as coinbase knows their customer base and don't want to deal waith any BTC/BCH overlap at all.  
Thanks, I didn't pick up on that but now it's obvious.
Who is the most reputable place to buy BCH from in the US? 
"-Buying BCH with money:

* kraken.com

* uphold.com

* bitstamp.com

* bitcoin.com (coming soon)

-Buying BCH with other cryptocurrenices (like Bitcoin and Ethereum):

* Bittrex.com

* Shapeshift.io

* Hitbtc.com

Additionally:

> Go to coin marketcap.com, type in BCH, click on “markets“, and you will see the exchanges where it can be purchased with BTC.

Crypto-only exchanges like Shapeshift are going to be faster than a fiat exchange like uphold."

"Charlie Lee is one of the creator of Litecoin, and his coin and his vision is pretty much directly opposed to the one of Bitcoin Cash. Outside of Blockstream I would argue he is probably the biggest supporter of SegWit. So you can bet that he will do whatever he can to prevent it from being listed. He also basically just joined Coinbase to get Litecoin accepted on it, which he succeded in doing. He then bailed and is now working on Litecoin again.

Extremely bullish because millions of Coinbase users are finally going to get to dump their Bcrash. Right. Par for course with the intelligence of this sub.
To remain critical: I don't know how coinbase system works but could it be possible that this is a necessary step to make the long ago announced withdrawals on 1. Jan possible instead of adding a buy option for bch?
How is this bullish? Allowing withdrawals eventually, which they have stated,  is NOT the same as allowing trading.

Any other way to get BCH?"
I am super PUMPED! 
"So where is the ""BTC wallet"" in the list?"
Hopefully coinbase will give me back the 20 BCH I sent to my coinbase BTC address by error. I contacted their support and they told me they are lost, but... they really aren't since coinbase has the private keys and can control them... coinbase's argument is that their system is set up in a way that doesn't even allow themselves to access the private key without compromising their system security. I guess that's plausible, but still hurts.
I cancelled my weekly buys when it became obvious Bitcoin was broken. It will be cool to have the weekly Bitcoin Cash buys set up.
"It might go live in coinbase only for withdrawals, but in GDAX for actual trading at a first moment. Isn't GDAX more important than coinbase in this sense?

I think this is fake. I just checked my own Coinbase API and BCH does not appear.
BCH is in such a critical mass of good news... not speculating, just saying...
I think you mean BCASH

What's a good place to buy BCH?

Because the coinbase website/app are likely using the same API.
Often, the same API is used internally and externally. So the UI is just a special api client. So to build this feature into the UI it must first have API support.
Blockstream is probably running out of money so their trolls had to take a pay cut. Oftentimes you get the quality that you pay for.
"Nah it's ok, important is that you could create it. ;)"
Haha the trolls are afraid. If you believe coinbase users will dump the same quantity as the 500k more we have seen this past month you are crazy. That is without saying the number of people who will buy BCH just as there's people buying ETH and shit coin LTC. 
You guys have gotten dumber and dumber as each month passes by. Why do you even write sentences like this? Do you think anybody is going to change their viewpoint because of it?
"There would not be ""800 scam shitcoins"" if Bitcoin scaled properly."
Coinbase are supposedly going to be adding more cryptocurrencies next year, and they're enabling BCH withdrawals, so I'd think it's a good guess that BCH will come to Coinbase at some point in the future. 
Tell that to CryptoKitties

no, that is a standard security procedure to all api keys. it gives you time to delete the key in case you were hacked and it wasn't you who created it. it's not related to bch

Also, I am in Australia and it's quiet difficult to obtain BCH for the average person using AUD and I would like to help raise BCH awareness as there is a lot of Bitcoin adoption here and they are all investing in the wrong bitcoin and the Core Propaganda is fairly widespread here.

"The probability of mining 12 *consecutive* blocks is not the probability of mining a block * 12. 

As such to seccuesfully attack a network with 12 *consecutive* blocks would require much, much more than 150k. I don't remember the exact math right now, but it's quite a big number. "
At what rate is the cost of this attack increasing?
Is the attack possible without users noticing by somehow keeping the hashrate only slightly above 50%?
Bcash is just a pump and dump, Roger is luring youre money into his pockets this shoud be obvious by now.

The US charges you quite a bit itself, $2350 at last count (not much to someone with a bit of wealth but still a decent chunk of change). As a bonus though, US citizens are required to continue to file and pay taxes even if they are not resident in the US (there are only two countries in the world that do this).

"It is not fixed to 1 sat/byte, it can be 100 sat/KB, or 10 sat/KB.

>answered 70 minutes into the livestream
As has been said, fees are not hard-coded to a certain number of Satoshis/byte.  The only reason transactions should *ever* go up is if blocks get full and a fee market emerges.  Right now the only coin where this is happening is BTC, and it would not be happening if they had raised the blocksize or if transaction volume stayed low enough to keep the blocks from getting totally full.
right now fees are low bc 1. no ones uses bcash and 2. its a low price. 3. scaling on chain is not worth it and even roger himself agreed that off chain scaling is a great solution. but he has other underlying reasons for trying to split the community. He should be working hard to implement segwit so that the blocksize could increase instead of working against bitcoin.

"> Has anyone reviewed or audited the source code of any BCH wallets? If so, how can we confident that they have? Even if the wallet is open source, how do we know that the executable was compiled from the code on Github? Which wallet is safest for off-line storage?

Let's say you have a private key that controls both BTC and BCH with the same key. In that case you should first move all BTC to a new address with the BTC wallet app that you already trust and after that move has had at least 1 confirmation on the BTC network, you could swipe (better) or import that private key into your BCH wallet that you don't trust as much.

In that case you would not risk losing any BTC but only risk losing all of your BCH that are controlled by that specific private key."
"3) (partial) Trustless means that you can inspect the code which is open source and compile it for yourself from source, if you are keen to do so. Both things require techinical knowledge, tho.

"It's the implication, and you can bluster and act like you're not trying to make it sound like he was selling TNT in the Middle East or IEDs or something, but you clearly were trailing that ""explosives"" comment out there that way, instead of just saying he sold fireworks.

My point is that Roger Ver and his advocacy for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash can be just as trusted as any person who has not been in prison.
"Gasoline explode in the combustion chamber, if you want to twist things. But you don't call it an explosive. It is not the intended use of gasoline or fireworks to destroy something in the explosion like the normal use of an explosive like TNT.

Anything that can explode is explosive (adjective). But not all of them are explosives (substantive)."

That's the positive side of them bringing it up, yes. I'm just correcting their propaganda against the trustworthiness of Roger Ver and the ideas about Bitcoin (Cash) that he advocates.
"The small blockers say ""Roger spent jail time for selling illegal explosives"" to make that event sound much worse than it actually was in an attempt to make people distrust Roger and his ideas. The context of using the expression ""illegal explosives"" instead of ""unlicensed fireworks"" matters. If Roger would've bought the license then his fireworks business would've been considered legal."
And I got caught with a pitcher of beer when I was 18, does that make me a moonshiner?
Sounds like a feasible attack, but since it is well known, in the place of the exchange I would require longer confirmation in case of a re-org.

"You are actually required to pay all unrealized capital gains as part of your exit - i.e. they treat renunciation as meaning you disposed of all assets and paid taxes based on the FMV at that time.

So Roger timed his exit quite well, as Bitcoin was worth a lot less then (not sure when exactly, but several years ago).

So for bitcoiners right now, renunciation could be very costly.

How's FreeSociety coming btw? Wish I had asked about that earlier.
"The block size is the max size a block can have and there’s no forced requirement to have to fill the block to that size. Using Moore’s law to increase the max cap has many advantages. 

For one thing, the network throughput and storage follow Moore’s curve and having bitcoin also follow it means that one could have blocks getting bigger (if they need to) without network congestion and without subjective human involvement.  "
He did not answer the question
what did he say? 
Thanks! 
Well, I'm not Roger, but I can say that BCH-related checkboxes etc were spotted by people looking at their API page, so it seems very likely they have built complete support for BCH. Whether or not they enable full support,however, is a political decision most likely.
"Thanks!

Anyone willing to summarise what he said? (Can't watch - I'm at work)
Can someone please reply with what he said? I'm in a loud social place now and can't watch the ama.

"You are kidding, right?  A host of digital currencies, many copied from the original Bitcoin source code and that have no more utility than fiat (except for Venezuelans, Koreans and the ""unbanked"") won't be affected by a Bitcoin crash?  Better do some sums. "
Wow cool :) I'll have to watch it now :D
Aww salty boy is hatin' :D
Reread my first sentence lol
"Thanks for this AMA.

> He came back and answered more questions.

The YT video is 2:19:20. Where can we see the ""second part"" after we came back?

Wondering if he answered [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7klo1n/im_roger_ver_ceo_of_bitcoincom_and_worlds_first/drfi2pl/) about free speech and censorship."

He said that unless there were issues specifically regarding tether then it would likely remain roughly equal to USD during a cryptocurrency crash, but he doesn't know a lot about tether's potential problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoSuwEgrshU&t=220s
Indefinitely AFAIK. But note that he is talking about non-residents and not ex-citizens.
"Eritrea is the only other country which does this. It's the reason that US citizens who move abroad usually give up citizenship. Also the ""exit tax"" is hiking every year. The $2350 that OP cited are are not the whole story, it can depend. The worst case scenario is 40% of your wealth (it's probably close to what Roger paid)."
That’s probably a good thing or 95% of our CEO’s would have foreign addresses and no tax liability. You know, like the companies themselves! 
Eritrea.
"I wasn't making a judgement call. You can just replace ""answered"" with ""responded"" and the result is the same. This is a time stamp and the wording was chosen specifically to make it clear in terms of AMA threads. There may be a part 2 coming later so feel free to post another question in the thread."
Ok thanks!
I didn’t think it was necessary to specify that I wasn’t talking about scams and coins created for fun and the like.
Did you find it? I wasn't able to locate it...
tl dr? 
Bitcoin Core has been co-opted into some sort of science project by people who don't understand how money works, and the way to avoid the same thing happening to BCH is to grow the adoption and industry as fast as possible.
He said that he's interested in things facilitating a token-based blockchain use like Ethereum and privacy-centered coins like DASH. 
"Roger sold fireworks without having bought a license to be allowed to do it. They were not ""explosives""."
The probability of finding 12 consecutive blocks *before* the remaining 49% mining power finds just one is tiny. 
This is the most active AMA we've ever done on r/btc, and I suspect a few bitter BCH dumpers from back in the $300 days are downvoting random things out of spite.

Lots of people lost money because of his scammy wallet.
are your customers confused there are US Dollars and Canadian Dollars too?
"No, I know he is done a lot for the Bitcoin Cash community. 

What I think CAN be a problem is centralization of power. I know he agrees with me on that. "
"Answer from me:


""Little Bitcoin"" (LTC) gives us more of Blockstream. They will ditch LTC at the first opportunity, as they have before. Only one thing matters to them right now, removing BCH as the alternative to sidechains that everbody wants. LTC benefits, temporarily:

Actually he said he sold all his bitcoins, he only has bch now.

"There is no comment on this question at the 104 mark.  Please clarify.

No , Bcash is already trademarked and a crypto is coming out named Bcash. Bcash is also a term used to mock Bitcoin Cash supporters.
It was samourai wallet. Check their twitter feed.

Yup on the road, heard it in the car. 
That doesn't explain anything about other coins and certainly doesn't really cover how it's different from Bitcoin.
Yes, I am a fan of movements that are attempting to help empower people by giving them more power over their finances. I am a fan of taking  power away from the Corporations and Governments that try to exercise undue power over people. Bitcoin Cash is a lot more than just a payment system.
"Thanks, just found it as well!

I guess I could have made a better case for a simpler and smaller address change, as I quickly wrote the question to improve the chance of him reading it. 

But maybe all the bech32 improvements are worth it being more verbose and he's right it's not like the current format is that readable anyway."

Not sure if anyone asked this already but when can I get a Bitcoin.com card?
Green or Orange logo?
"Roger,

First let me thank you for all you have done for the crypto space. I'm sure being portrayed as some sort of evil mastermind can be frustrating and I respect your tenacity to stick to your guns and promote what you feel is right.

Second, as someone with software development skills and the ability to contact and influence a lot of people in the space, what can I do to help spread adoption of Bitcoin Cash? Is there anything I can do to help push merchant adoption or acceptance, and if so can you point me in the right direction. Thanks!"
Any updates on the Bitcoin Debit Card and can you explain why visa debit cards that settle with Bitcoin Cash is amazing?
"Hi Roger!  Thanks for everything you've done for the community and BCH, don't let the trolls get to you.

I was overjoyed when I saw the post about the Bitcoin.com credit card.  Any news on when we should be expecting that?"
What are the biggest risks to blockchain and cryptocurrencies? Governments, technologies, people in authority, hacking, others?
"Hi Roger, 
I only have 0.05 Bitcoin, its all I have however it is unconfirmed stuck in a transaction, what should I do. Please help Roger. P.S Thank you for all your help in Bitcoin!

Is ltc just four times the current adoption rate until it has the same issues as btc, how does bch avoid growing into these issues as well. Also how will we compete with no fee coins? 
"I have to be honest I've never actually heard or seen Roger talk. I mostly know him through the attacks on his person here on reddit.

He seems like a really reasonable guy though. I was really expecting something different for some reason. Good job."
"Hi Roger, you are Master Shifu in my books. your original Dragon warrior went rogue. 

recent convert after seeing your interview with BitcoinErrorLog. Thank you for your sermons. 

- One puzzling Question for me - Why do you think Visa would help BCH users spend their value using bitpay card ? Could never understand they would do it for a 2% cut  from the merchants, which has long term repurcussions for Visa. I ask this since bitcoin.com is also planning to bring this

- We need to have folks make HOWTO videos to use BCH as currency(I am not good in spoken English) using bitpay or direct wallet-to-wallet"
"Hi Roger,
1 What is needed for BCH to be seen as a continuation of the original Bitcoin project but in a version that scales. How long will it take for businesses to regain trust and return to this block chain in stead of building stuff on other block chains.

2 I believe Bitcoin and therefor BCH can change the world for the better. How long do you think it will take for the adoption to reach critical mass. How will we recognise success in reaching the goal of mass adoption."
Will Bitcoin's Proof of Work cause less adoption because of its environmental problems - not making the world a better place. Would a Proof of Stake network be better like ethereum?
They always say: diversify. Which other coin do you hold or would you recommend to hold?
Roger, what do you envision your role in the crypto space to be in the next 1-3 years?
What are your thoughts about crypto debit cards? Not all retailers that I transact with accept cryptocurrency.
"Have you seen the ""Stash"" node,  what are your thoughts on this privacy tool??

(chris odom, stash)   Can bitcoin cash use these type of addresses??"
can BTC and BCH coexist or will BCH replace BTC completely in the case of a flippening?
Roger, do you think that the principle difference between Core supporters and Bitcoin supporters is political? I've noticed that the vast majority of people who seem to be OK with destroying Bitcoin and replacing it with something else are opposed to the libertarian nature of Satoshi's design.
Roger, please tell us about the process of renouncing US citizenship to avoid paying taxes on the capital gains.  Please tell us about how you went through the process and tell us about any tips or advice you have on leaving the country.

What do you expect to happen when Coinbase releases the BCH shares to the BTC holders? Do you expect BCH price to fall and recover, or maybe something else?
"Hi Roger, I hope you're doing well.

What keeps you going in this toxic atmosphere? A lot of important people quit (like Gavin Andresen and others) due to the constant harrassment they face online and sometimes even in real life. You are undoubtedly the target of a lot of online hate, this would probably scare many people away. You are a huge millionaire after all and most people might just quit never to return.

So what keeps you going? I love what you do and feel very sorry for the constant ad-hominem attacks. Keep doing what you do!"

Does Bcore have any upside potential for the 2018 year? If yes, does it come from greed of speculators or somewhere else? Its clear there have not been any tech improvements to back up this hike to 19K. How much of your own portfolio is still held in Bcore?
"Hi Roger,
While I agree with you that bitcoin scaling has been handled poorly I remain unconvinced by bitcoin cash. Having used bitcoin and various altcoins for many years I have a hard time understanding why I would want to use BCH over many other altcoins. Most of the altcoins are faster and cheaper than BCH while also often ahead in terms of technology and features. Additionally to me the centralized ASIC mining in BTC has been a significant disadvantage, how would you sell BCH as a currency to me?"
"Are you currently pushing for all the online places that accept bitcoin to accept bitcoin cash? 

Personally I think bitcoin cash needs to be accepted by the online gambling industry to really catch on and take hold.  Most online casinos started to accept bitcoin when it was cheap to send and useful and around that time bitcoin really started taking off."
"Hey Roger another question. If a loved one of yours heard you were involved in this ""bitcoin thing"" and then got you bitconnect coins for christmas because they were cheaper, what would you tell them and how would you handle those coins?"
@Rodger ​how do you protect your  bch system which by design has less full nodes, from aggressive government attacks ?﻿
"Hi Roger, thank you for doing this!

2. What do you think would it take to decrease the volatility and start pricing things natively in BCH vs. USD?"
What is stopping a large change in hasrate distribution between the two networks? While mining btc is more profitable as a small miner I can’t afford to pay the fees associated with the legacy network.

What's the difference between a paper wallet and something like a nano ledger s?
Roger, what are your criticisms of bitcoin cash, or do you consider it a perfect project? Do you think what happened to core could also happen to the developers of the BCH client?

"Roger, had any thought been put in to doubling the block size every 18 months so that it follows Moore’s law?

So if 8 mb are handled fine right now in 18 months the block size would be 16 MB then 18 months later it would be 32 MB and so forth and so on. "
"I have nothing to ask but I want to say two things:

- You are doing a great job, one of the best! We are lucky to have you in the community, whatever the fake grassroots sockpuppet accounts say about you online. 
- I wish you would block all the Blockstream sockpuppet accounts on your twitter account. They embarrass themselves (Blockstream/Lightning corps) but they also make it impossible for people like me to benefit from the interesting discussions that would normally follow from your tweets. I feel like I am missing out on something that would be of great value

Otherwise, best of luck. I think we owe you a lot, never forget we will be here for you should you need us (I speak for myself but I think many share my opinion)

Where do you see Bitcoin Cast fitting into the picture with respect to Litecoin?  It seems that Litecoin has real world use cases but the focus from Bitcoin Cash is always in regards to Bitcoin itself.  Also, how will Atomic Swaps between LTC and BTC play into this long-term?
">In 2002, Ver pleaded guilty after selling explosives, marketed as Pest Control Report 2000, on eBay, which the U.S. Department of Justice described as ""dealing in explosives without a license"", and he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison. The Missouri company, Max 2000 Inc. that had manufactured Pest Control Report 2000, agreed to cease selling the agricultural firecrackers in January 2003 after selling more than one million of them. The company had been selling the product illegally to fireworks wholesalers and retailers from early 1998. Pest Control Report 2000 had been used nationally to control infestations of birds. The explosives were banned because they could cause serious injuries or death.

"Is there a long term plan to keep this forum relatively free of memes and price threads? As Bitcoin Cash grows we are beginning to draw more and more new people, many new to cryptocurrency as a whole, and less discussions as a result of these new people. I think it's important that r/bch and r/bitcoincash always remain a place of open technical discussion, political discussion, and major achievement of the coin overall. Those types of topics are incredibly educational to those that want to learn more about the currency as a whole.

Contrarily, a forum with a meme-to-serious ratio of 10:1 is difficult to respect.

Note: I don't mind occasional memes, they can be great!"

Could you talk about the current dev team and work in progress on BCH?
Have you ever been pressured or extorted, or offered bribes by a government agent/agency or other organization for altering your public stance on Bitcoin? Some people feel that this may be the reason for the core devs change in direction, and if so it would make sense that a high profile person such as yourself would have received a similar type of pressure - whether effective or not.
"Roger-
Are there any alt-coin projects that you are excited about or are invested in?"
u/memorydealers was it a mistake to call bch as bitcoin cash, instead of just bitcoin. Bitcoin has hardforked before but it didn't get a name change. BCH is the true satoshi bitcoin, therefore naming it as bitcoin cash seems misleading. The core guys who tacked on segwit fundamentally alterered bitcoin, so they should be the one having to name their project something else. 
"Roger, as Bitcoin Cash price goes up, do you expect cloud mining contracts to remain profitable in the near term (i.e. next 6 months to 12 months) ?

"Hi Roger,

What do you think about the continuous printing of USD Tether, and do you think they are all (>1 bil USDT) backed by USD? If they are not, how would you think this would influence the overal market? And in particular Bitcoin Cash?

Thanks!"
"Roger,

Bitcoin Cash is climbing as we can all see.  I've been into crypto for 4 years now an nobody around me took me seriously until now.  Younger people would listen to me some but older people wouldn't.  Now, I've got a bunch of 50+ year old people asking me about it that have heard about it in the news lately.  What's the best way for me to explain to them Bitcoin Cash when they're always asking about Bitcoin?  I constantly have to tell them how ""Bitcoin"" is now synonymous with high fees, slow confirmations, and centralization while Bitcoin Cash is the one they want because of the total opposite.  Older folks don't like to hear ANY bad news about Bitcoin but it's simply not possible to explain it to them without telling them about Core/Legacy.

Thanks!"
Are you able to share something on the progress of the Free Society project?
"1) Why do you think is there so much divisiveness between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash supporters, and do you think there is a chance both can coexist?

2) when either Bitcoin supporters claim they care about ""decentralization"" I feel there is an elephant in the room: a minuscule percentage of users own almost all the Bitcoin, making Bitcoin wealth even less evenly distributed than fiat. On top of it, the market being highly speculative, only the wealthy can afford to buy it at the moment given the risk. How do you think Bitcoin adoption can ever become mainstream if only a select handful can afford to own it (or got lucky and have a ridiculous amount)?

**edit** he didn't answer the second question, but that's because I added it later, not because he was ducking it."

"Hi Roger,

I'm from India and I'm excited about any cryptocurrency that offers cheap, premissionless, and fast cross-border transactions because of the strict currency conversion laws here. I'd like to spend my crypto rather than just hold it.

The problem in India is that we end up paying a 5% mark-up when buying into most cryptocurrencies which means that spending it costs us more than a paypal transaction. What do you see as the solution for emerging countries like India to gain equal-price-access to cryptocurrencies, because right now we're being price-gouged by middle-men.

Thanks

Hi roger, I'm a student at the University Of Toronto and i'm building an application for users to buy and sell time from eachother with 3 other friends. Were nearly complete, but we desperately want to integrate BCH payments into our application. Since bitpay has announced incoming support in 2018, do you think that there will be many other liquidity providers jumping on board? What about if a user of our application pays another user in USD but the receiving user wanted payment in BCH? Do you know of any prvider who offers such a service? Keep fighting the good fight Roger!

"Hi Roger, thank you for doing this, much appreciated. Got a couple questions, feel free to answer none, some or all of them :)

1. What are your thoughts on the new address format that BCH will be adopting? Do you think this format is sufficient in the longterm for mainstream adoption or can you see us altering it further?

2. Do you have an update on when we can expect to be able to purchase BCH through bitcoin.com(with fiat)? I gather it was delayed due to your liquidity provider taking longer than you initially thought.

3. Do you have information about what (1) the fees will be on the BCH debit card and (2) whether it will instantly convert the balance to fiat upon funding, or if you will be able to hold BCH on it until you actually purchase a good or service?

4. With the re-enabling of op codes in BCH, do you have any example of what possibilities will be opened up? Personally I would like to see BCH focus on being the best form of money and so if it enables any advanced monetary features then I'm all for it.

5. Are you currently planning on implementing Cash-shuffle into the bitcoin cash wallet?

6. What are your thoughts on how we can make 0-conf better and more usable for merchants and consumers alike? Linking to this, do you have an opinion on the purposed idea of 'sub-chains'?

"Roger, as a libertarian, I like BCH because of it's low fees and quickness. However, as I read more about other cryptocurrencies, I can't help but feel that there are other great technologies out there and BCH needs to compete with them.

One example is Monero, which promises complete privacy, which as I said, as a libertarian, is very much appealing to me. Can you do a comparison perhaps or do you know if various BCH development teams have a plan on improving privacy?"

"Roger,

Thanks for all the work you've done for the crypto space, it's people like you that are really giving life to this new technology.

My question is about the fungibility of BCH. This seems to be one of the biggest flaws with BCH as a cash system. The technology is designed around tracking property, and while it doesn't have to be tied to a specific person's identity, the majority of places to buy BCH (and other cryptos) require bank account #'s, phone verification, and picture ID's. 

So, what are the best solutions in the near future for improving BCH's anonymity? Is it possible to have true anonymity on this particular chain? How important do you consider fungibility in the grand scheme of BCH?

Thank you for your time."

"Roger, Thanks for doing this. I've been a long time fan of yours, I'm sorry for all the troll hate you get. Honestly, 99% of trolls can't even spell trolls. 

In the current situation 

* high fees
* Political grid lock 
* how people view the goal (ie. gold)
* What's the real BTC coin....(this is nearly a waste of argument and time I think)


I should first say, you're 100% right the coin was meant as a cash system. However, limit supply among an increasing price makes that quite difficult to understand the value of goods. 

Here my questions, 

1. Would you be ok with making BTC a store of value and not a payment based system?
2.Picking a different coin as a payment system?
3. Would you be ok with, LTC a payment coin as it will be easy to have atomic swaps, low fee's, and even a faster payment process?
 
I think LTC is interesting, as it's not hard to a) convert a payment system over to LTC as it shares a large amount of code b) It doesn't come with the political issues of which is the real BTC. 


Finally, what's the biggest lesson you learned in life?


Thanks again. "

"Hey roger! Could you look into creating a point of sales solution for merchants?  I use coinpayments.net but their point of sales solution is unacceptable for brick-and-mortar stores because it is extremely slow and I haven't found a different solution.  The bitcoin.com wallet is excellent especially in the area of 0-conf transactions as brick and mortar locations need to detect the full payment in seconds.  The characteristics of a Point Of Sales solution that I am looking for is as follows:
-Enter sales price in USD
-detects 0-conf transaction as fast as possible
-option to open without authentication only to accept payment (so employees could accept payment but not send)
My apologies if this is a question irrelevant to this AMA"

"You have me totally sold on the value of Bitcoin Cash! The pros are outstanding!

Can you speak to the cons of Bitcoin Cash? What are its biggest flaws / limitations? Thanks Roger."
Roger, after the flippening, what's next for Blockstream?
"1)  We all agree that BCH most fits Satoshi’s definition of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin.com should be promoting mainly the real bitcoin, not the store-of-value Bitcoin.  When do you plan to explain to readers about the difference between BCH and BTC and why Bitcoin.com will be dedicated to the Bitcoin that adheres to Satoshi’s definition of Bitcoin?

2)  If you do #1, then you should also explain to readers the history of Bitcoin’s scaling debate, in-fighting and eventual divorce into BCH and BTC (https://medium.com/@curt0/bitcoin-divorce-bitcoin-legacy-vs-bitcoin-cash-explained-31a1f147527d).  Because of this divorce, BTC holders will come to Bitcoin.com to troll and bash on the commenting section.  If newbies understand the history and divorce, then they will understand why trolls are bashing BCH.  Otherwise, they might think that there is legitimate criticism towards BCH.

3)  One of the promises of Bitcoin was to be able use a trust-less currency.  However, users need to trust wallets.

There are news about scam wallets that are stealing coins, such as the mybtgwallet (Bitcoin Gold) and Coinpouch wallets.  They blamed Bitcoingold.org for publishing a link to the scam wallet and for not having audited the wallet beforehand.  Has anyone reviewed or audited the source code of any BCH wallets?  If so, how can we be confident that they have?  Even if the wallet is open source, how do we know that the executable was compiled from the code on Github?  Which wallet is safest for off-line storage?

Thanks for everything you've done!"
"Hey Roger, a few questions.

1) Would you comment on why you advertised MtGox as a solvent?

2) Do you think CSW is actually Satoshi and if so, why do you think he used fake proof?

3) Why are you still holding Bitcoins when in fact you stated that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin?

4) Why is Bitcoin Cash nowhere advertised on Bitcoin.com's homepage? Are you not proud of the name you chose?

And a bonus Q:

5) Do you think that being a millionaire makes a technical argument stronger and being wealthy, but not rich makes a technical argument weaker?

Thanks for your time."
"First of all thank you for your work Roger.

Now as for a question, did you believe Bitcoin to succeed? Or was it that you wanted it to succeed, but weren't so sure if it would actually work?"
"Good luck. Am supposed to be working so can't really watch the video but will try and check in now and again.

Have a great Christmas and New year :-)"
"The following is from Bitcoin core's website itself regarding possible detriments of Segwit in relation to it increasing bitcoin's blocksize:
https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/

""Risks due to larger blocks:

*Larger blocks will result in higher resource requirements for full nodes, potentially causing users to shut down their nodes, which would result in higher centralisation. 

The negative impact of larger blocks is limited in a number of ways:

*Pruning support allows users to run full nodes without storing the entire history of the blockchain, which allows users who have constrained storage resources to continue running full nodes, even with a larger block size.""

Is ""pruning"" feasible and if so, assuming its also available for Bitcoin Cash, will this greatly diminish centralization of BCH even as blocks get very large as it scales? Also do you feel that its hypocrital of Core supporters to so heavily condemn blocksize increase when Core can be shown here indicating it can be mitigated?"
What % of your bitcoin did you sell? Why would you continue to hold if you're pessimistic about bitcoin's future? 
When is Bitcoin.com going to turn green and start promoting Bitcoin Cash exclusively? 
"What do you see as the most important conditions necessary for widescale mass adoption of cryptocurrencies for every day use? The biggest problem I see is the large fluctuations (against fiat) currently. I've talked with merchants and they've heard about Bitcoin but can't accept it because their accountants don't know what to do with it, and they're businesses who particularly hate banks and have to work mostly in cash (marijuana dispensaries). How do we get to a place where people know what a Bitcoin is ""worth"" and quote prices in those units rather than conversions from USD, etc?"
"Question regarding fees on BCH:
Transaction fee is defined as per byte and in satoshis , yes? 

So now with 125 bytes transaction - minimal fee (that is nonzero) is 125 satoshis per tx. 

With the price of BCH say $2000 it is 125/(100 000 000) * 2000 = $0,0025

I mean - if the price of the coin will go up, won't fees go up accordingly.  Only because 1 satoshi / byte is the minimal fee that user can enter into the wallet.

Or can you set whole transaction fee to 1 satoshi ? Thanks in advance for info

Do I understand it correctly? What am I missing?

for the first hour, it was obvious that u had to summon extra brain power to pull out the correct suffix viz ""core"" from your memory cells, when u needed to refer to bitcoin-btc.

i propose that if u start using btc for core , btc will roll off your tongue so much more easily...with no extra brain-power required !!

also it gives the ecosystem  a certain symmetry where we might expect greg, adam or luke sporting  a t-shirt with ""BTC PLZ"" splashed across the front

also on your wallet it would be so much easier for noobs if they see ""bitcoin-bch [cash]"" and ""bitcoin-btc [core]"" instead of bitcoins-cash & core

As a trader, it's often a red flag that the leadership style of a CEO takes on an arrogant tone riddled with hostile criticisms and snarky remarks. I have no biases, I'm just a humble trader trying to come out ahead, but your behavior and attitude as of late is reminiscent of the leadership involved in big crashes like Enron and Bear Stearns, and I wouldn't be surprised if an answer to this question was met with the snarky, arrogant attitude I just described. But none-the-less, I would like to hear your side of the story.

It's nice that the answers were streamed live but for anyone who wants to just read the questions and answers there is no way I would sit through (or skip around) hours of video. Being able to spend 5 minutes reading the questions and answers I want is HUGELY important to AMAs and the benefit those Q&As have as written content. I think many others would probably agree.
Are you a Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash maximalist or do you hold/believe in any other cryptos?
Roger, I mostly agree with your stance on taxes. However, isn't taxation a requirement in order to finance necessary infrastructure and defense within a country?
Since you love BCH so much then why would you not be supporting Litecoin, which offers everything that BCH does and has also been time tested and is secure?
Did you once breach your own company’s privacy policy just so that you can get $50 worth of bitcoin back?
"Roger!

Firstly, you've gotten flack from some of your comments/actions.  I mean, considering your moniker, just ask yourself, WWJD?  Then breathe, and remember, I'm asking myself, WWBJD?  /commafail

And, mainly, have you seriously considered the implications of Bitcoin Cash being a payment competitor for the streaming/web donation space?  Compare BCH fees to Patreon.  Also, this is a space that requires public education, and you're essentially using the streamers as self-interested BCH-amabassadors.  I think we'd need a document that went over the basics of security, usage, and like some sort of mechanism for ""technical support"".

I'm fairly confident I'm not the person to do this.  But, if I don't see my Tesla streamers giving an option to donate in BCH I'm going to cry.  I mean, think of people who stream content that wants to change the world for the better with their wealth and not lambos/hookers/blow.

"With Bitcoin Core not being what you (plural) wanted it to be, you decided to fork it and do it your way (still plural of course) and name it Bitcoin Cash. 

With the problem for multiple currencies to be called Bitcoin something comes a lot of confusion for users if we want it to be accepted globally (would it be core or cash), why didn't you decided to launch a new crypto with a new name with the vision you wanted? Wouldn't it be easier in term of branding and public vision? 
After all, Bitcoin is an open source project which evolved to become what it is now (good or bad, depends on who you ask), not something written in stone from day 1.

"BCH follows the actual definition of Satoshi's vision closer than BTC, this is correct. With that said, why do you think it has to be such a battle between yourself and the Bitcoin core team and the BCH contingent you are a part of?

i don't expect you to ever admit it, but it's obvious that you're trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand because you disagree with the core team. It seems to me that the support of BCH is lower than it could be because people don't trust you. This is due to the bitcoin.com wallet suggesting BCH is BTC, contentious hard forks, and your general attitude towards the core team. Would you ever step away from the BCH project if it was apparent that you were hurting it's reputation?

"What are your thoughts on implementing an industry-wide, cogent and sensible marketing strategy for Bitcoin Cash?

- Make 'Bits' the standard denomination for Bitcoin Cash. 1 bit = 100 satoshi's.
- We change the Bitcoin Cash colour to green everywhere.
- bit value used as standard on all exchanges so 1 bit = $0.002.
- Ticker is changed from BCH (created by Core supporters) to CSH.

&nbsp;

This will require a lot of organising behind the scenes but I think it is possible. We have a chance right now while the industry is still young, small and disorganised to implement this. Once we grow, it will never change again.

&nbsp;

This will achieve a number of things:

1. There will no longer be the argument that Bitcoin Cash is 'expensive'. In fact it will seem 'cheap' using the same psychology.
2. People will understand that the smallest unit you can is very small (many people think you can only buy 1 BCH).
3. By using green industry-wide we will have unified branding that represents cash.
4. With CSH our ticker will no longer sound like bitch, and won't have been given to us by core supporters. It will sound like Cash which is what Bitcoin Cash is."

Are you aware of the solutions that the developers are working on for this?

You've repeatedly offered approved submitter status as a counter to people interviewing/questioning you complaining they can only make 1 post every 10 minutes. I've yet to be given this, and it makes it very difficult for me to engage with members of this community when 10 people can respond to me in that time frame and I can only respond back once, and only after 10 minutes.

So can I have approved submitter status?

You did this after a week of me posting useful information for the community under your tweets, which makes me feel like you only blocked me because you didn't like it.

The following is from Bitcoin core's website itself regarding possible detriments of Segwit in relation to it lowering fees:

https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/

""Risks due to lower fees:
The security of the Bitcoin blockchain is provided by hashpower, which is rewarded by both a fixed block reward and by fees from individual transactions. As a result, decreases in fee income have the potential to reduce the hashpower used to mine Bitcoin, which in turn may lower the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.

In so far as the individual transaction fees are determined by market forces and supply and demand, the changes introduced by segwit may risk lowering prices by increasing supply (presuming that demand does not also rise, either because of or at least concurrent with segwit deployment), and lower individual prices may result in lower overall mining revenue (if the price elasticity of demand is in the inelastic range).

In addition, the changes made in segwit may make “layer two” solutions, such as the Lightning Network, more compelling. If this leads to users treating layer two solutions as a substitute for on-chain transactions, this may significantly decrease demand for on-chain transactions, which would put additional downward pressure on transaction fee levels.

Avoidance
Fees are currently approximately 0.5 BTC per block versus 12.5 BTC per block from the block subsidy, or about 4% of miner income, so the potential impact on miner income and hence network security is likely small in the short term.

In addition, fees have been rising over the past twelve months both in BTC denominated value (from under 0.2 BTC per block a year ago) and in real terms (from under $300 USD per BTC a year ago, to over $600 USD per BTC today), so moderate falls in fee levels will only be equivalent to reverting to fee incomes from up to twelve months ago, which should not be a major impact.""

https://fork.lol/ shows that currently BTC fees are ~19% of miner income as opposed to 4% quoted here. Also it shows the ratio of mining profitability between BTC and BCH is within 10%. 

1. What predicitions would you make long term given Core's concern and this data? 

2. Do you think BCH will substantially gain increasing share of hashing power as fees drop when BTC does implement Lightning Network and/or use of Segwit?

Because I understand how given one genesis block you can get the next one and count up to the current block. I can verify every proof of work. Given just an address, how do I check the total difficulty of the chain that produced it without all the blocks? Because you need to know this and verify it to be true.
"You don't need to check. You trust the network not go over the 21 million limit even though it could. You trust it not to hard fork and take all your coins. Why is it so hard to trust the network and a algorithm that decides enough hashing power was used and enough time has passed (say 2 weeks or more + 1000 confirms) to say hey that transaction from point A to point B is valid we no longer need to know about its proof of work.
Think about how pruning works, turn it up a notch and think out of the box.

"
"How did miners verify next block after the genesis block? 

All miners really need is the previous set of transactions.  imagine a  blockchain/database with an account for every current balance, if that balance reaches 0 the account is removed, new accounts are created if they receive a  balance from a confirmed existing account or from a mining reward.  

You no longer need the type of blockchain we have now because every new block is the genesis block created by the network and that ""block"" if that is what you want to call it is just a ledger of all current balances. millions of addresses, some new and some getting removed. The  transactions don't exist, only the balances exist on the main ledger. The transactions did exist at some point in time but they were confirmed by a very secure network over a period of time and removed. The final balances are now the alpha and omega.

Feels like we are going in circles here."

Here's a good introduction to our side of the story: https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43
"how do you know?  citations required; and not some bullshit from Bcore armchair economics.  btw, those are economic arguments about centralization from big blks, just going to show how little Bcore knows about the subject.  low fees do work and are what brought Bitcoin to where it is now.  we don't need some mythical, dreamed up, hype called LN esp while you're crippling onchain scaling to try and make your delusion come true.  sorry, you're not going to siphon tx fees offchain to your centralized LN hubs or sidechains.  the community won't allow it, hence the miserable embarrassing lack of uptake of segshit."
Making a business decision opens the doors to centralizing the governence, the focus should be on maintaining a chain to last 100+ years without any intervention.
May I ask why L2 needs to land before we can up the block size? What's wrong with burning the candles from both ends asap. 
Same triggered response I always get when your proven wrong. Just use simple logic. Don't be emotionally involved in your  altcoin. Do some research. And explore outside of reddit.
fees are high b/c of the 1MB cripple, understand?  growth is expected and so should there be growth in blocksize, yet here we have an uncooperative, silent, disinterested core dev.  no, this is a long term chronic problem for the BTC SOV.
They are getting more fees because people demand there transactions to get through, so could pass on incentives for miners to mine their pool, very simple. Temporary problem for a long term store of wealth.
 Understand that 99% of BCH code is core, it's just copy pasted, you forgot.
Computer science experts who don't understand economics, game theory, or inventive structures have no business being core devs.
Security down grades with blocksize, nodes become servers. Moore's law can't keep up with exponential growth of a network its better to go layer 2 first then expand the blocksize under it . It doesn't matter if low fees made it great, it doesn't work. Everything your saying is right out of the ver propaganda manual. Do your own research.
BCH automatically makes Bcore shills investors whether they like it or not.  Increasing blocksizes are what has made BTC great over the last 8y, not Bcore.  Security increases with blocksize, more users, more merchants, more tx's, more nodes, etc.  Get it?
your logic is flawed.  i just want to follow the WP, iow, what's worked for the last 8y.  this had nothing to do with segwit, LN, or sidechains.  why do you want to cripple Bitcoin?
Hey man we have tons of centralized alt coins just like BCH why is it any better? Because raising the blocksize is not how you scale indefinitely, it's a slippery slope, fees are temporary. You can't risk security for a coin that will last 100+ years just because you have a temporary transaction fee bloat.
"Stop with the Ver talking points because the're mostly false. Listen to some real computer science experts like 100s of the core devs . Bitcoin isn't crippled no one even uses it yet, it's just in an early phase, most people buy and look at the value grow. You gotta stop freaking out and make smarter choices because there's alot of scams out there. BCH is a scam, it's mined by Jihan Wu so he can maintain his ASIC boost profits, he's basically sucking money from your pockets. He owns majority of the hash rate on BCH 70%+. That's gross, that's not right. ASIC boost wasn't in the whitepaper, ASIC miners weren't in the white paper. You altered the DAA that's not original and can have consequences. You realise Segwit fixes the exploit of covert Asic boost.

 No wonder he's so for BCH without segwit."

Centralization in some parts is inevitable unless tech advance.
To be fair schnorr signatures should solve this problem. This is something that all coins should look to include.

No. Variance

To not starve
I think you misread the comment you replied to, because your reply makes no sense. Do you mean to tell me that the current governance is not dangerously centralized?
so you are asking for a handout from mining pools simply to compensate for a problem Bcore created?
"I don't think that changes the fact miners are being encouraged to hold their coins in a wallet outside of their own control.

It's fairly reasonable to expect to be able to transfer funds you've earned into your own wallet immediately and it's also understandable that people are saving up until they are able to make 1 large transaction. "
And their mistake is just Murphy's Law in action...figures :)
Ah right so lets just push all that generic propaganda to the side for a moment and then how about you actually tell me how it actually solves the problems inherent in the design of these currencies.
0.0002018 BCH /u/tippr
It's not a handout different business model.
Nothing, I have solar panels which produce way more power than I can use and I only mine when the sun's out
The fuck does that even mean?
Having 100s of developers is better then having 1 + Roger ver and fake Satoshi making decisions. Plus you got Jihan Wu with 70% of the mining power, it's totally not a buy.
"Looking forward to this addition! 
When will we be able to buy BCH with USD through Bitcoin.com?"
"> Why not hold on to btc until transactions get situated?

Many of us who have examined the technicals of Lightning are not convinced that it will ever be able to do what it has promised.

How long are you willing to wait. In the worst case, BTC has bet *EVERYTHING* on lightning, and if it failed, that could set crypto back years.

Instead, who who doubt Lightning simply forked and kept building on the original bitcoin trajectory. Because it was working and it's still working, and will continue working for a long damn time to come.

"
"> Why not hold on to btc until transactions get situated? 

You numbnuts. I've been holding since before transactions got fucked."
Bitcoin was working and we didn't have to wait for transactions to get situated. When you invest in a tech that works as a currency for the people, and then it becomes useless in order to have to wait for it to get situated is unacceptable. The core developers have been absolutely reckless by allowing this to happen. I wouldn't trust them even if they scaled Bitcoin on-chain after watching this censored debate for three years. Bitcoin needs diverse development.  
how does Core's taste?
"I second this. Otherwise it is clearly biased.
The app should let the user decide."
He's kidding, but honest.
"Agreed. There are plenty of scenaria where a bch fan needs to pay with btc. Kinda like xmr.to. 

A wonderful option would be a checkbox to accelerate the tx. 

Bitcoin.Com would be the only wallet with such a feature."
"Everywhere you can spend BCH (check out https://acceptbitcoin.cash) versus virtually nowhere - there are many, many places that nominally ""accepts"" BTC, but it no longer makes any sense to spend at those places."
If he doesn't offer, he is being biased, if he does offer, he is not putting his mouth where his money is. Oh boy...
BTC is the banking sector of Crypto right now. Holy ship.
"> It's bad enough for them that the app just supports BCH

BCH what you talking about?"
What's bcash?
Sorry Adam - was a word game.
"Lightening as problems to which no addition exists as of today.

In addition it is a new network that can't start small and grow it needs almost instant adoption and we see how that goes with SegWit.

LN is a nice idea but oversold and I wonder of it will ever be ready as a decentralized payment network.  
With centralized hubs I could see it in maybe 18 months."

I'm a fairly new adopter and know several others. At no point did any of suffer any confusion between btc and bch. To me these concerns seem fake. And your argument about the company just shows how far off the path you are, comparing a fork of bitcoin and bitcoin itself with a company. If it was possible to sue bch into the ground, it would have happened on August 2nd. 
"Not going help if the transaction can get confirmed. 

You probably die of thirst first :-)"
"I am calling you stupid because you are stupid. You quote the Bitcoin white paper title, and you intentionally don't highlight the Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System part and just highlight the Bitcoin name.

What you are doing is intentionally trying to make the people focus on the name, and not the working principle of the system which is not correct way to do it, you know it, and I know it, so if you want to talk facts, you fail big time.

A Bitcoin system is one that uses its working principles, as in **Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash** and name Bitcoin should be used by the system that uses this, and not some impostor that hijacked the name using trickery and dishonesty.

You can fuck off now."
keep your eyes open.  this sub posts threads of new merchants coming onboard that accept BCH.  this is increasing whereas on r/bitcoin merchants are only decreasing.  
[deleted]
I'd imagine a lot of people would do short term conversions. Personally, I would love to have an option to convert back because it would give me a sense of safety. I want to know that in case BCH starts plummeting, I can go back to BTC.
If you don't want yet more 1-star astroturf reviews from Core trolls, I'd implement support for both. It's bad enough for them that the app supports BCH at all, but they'd probably outright explode if any actual bias towards BCH appeared.
Well, your current price is almost 80% lower than the ATH BTC conversion rate, so 4 out of 5 bch holders have decided to go in the other direction.
"> I'm not sure why anyone would go in the other direction anyhow...

Someone must be on the other side of the trade. (Not necessarily with the bitcoin.com wallet though)."
"It would make sense to allow BCH->BTC as well. You can add a check of the current BTC fees and warn the user if they are unreasonably high (> $1) so that they do not get ""trapped"" with a cryptocurrency they cannot afford to spend."
If BCH is to win, it is actually good to help the fools sell their BCH early while the price is still low. 
Good point! I wouldn't want to go the other direction!
anyone who signed up to accept bitcoin did so with the idea that they would be using a system with low fees and not full blocks. 
I think you should have a BCH>BTC option but here is an idea: It doesn't actualy work! Instead you pop up in a RV video and lecture the idiot who want's to dump BCH on the error of his ways and why you will not allow him to sell his BCH. 
Is this some joke thread subreddit? 
"How much bcash do you have?

"
">Back is always bad

your implication there is your opinion and not fact. going BCH to BTC is not considered backwards for everyone. "
[deleted]
[deleted]
How does that work? Does it just sell them and give you fair market value for the btc and buy that much bch?
That's not really an option within a wallet without exchange registration.
"Please dump all your BTC. We're willing to ride the dip. 

ALL of it."
Unless it's a pain in the ass to implement giving more option is always a good thing. 
"They charge a fee of 1.25% per buy/sell plus a miner fee.

They are really expensive."
Really? Link? 
Ohh - look Back to the CEO of BS - common was a joke.
"And that's where it becomes a matter of opinion/philosophy. 
The difference between BCH and other forks, from my perspective, is that while other forks happened in order to do something different with Bitcoin, BCH happened because BTC was starting to become something different. And BCH wanted to preserve the original idea. Because of that I can see why the BCH people would claim to be the real Bitcoin."
Bitcoin layer is indeed Bitcoin system, but not the SegWit part, and while its Bitcoin system, its limited in capacity by intention of the people claiming to be protecting Bitcoin from attacks (Bitcoin Cash for example, big blockers, etc) which they don't want to use for transactions. So while Bitcoin BTC layer is still Bitcoin technically, the purpose of it being money, is already destroyed, which in turn makes it no longer Bitcoin - P2P Digital Cash.

Now when the ordinary man is regularly using cryptos then we can consider this statement... if it is still valid. "
[deleted]
I think I can see a pattern in there somehow.
"Steam stopped accepting because high fees and slow confirmations, Bitcoin went up because Tether fraud.

The two are unrelated. Correlation =/= causation...  
This should be incredibly obvious..."
You’re being shortsighted. The hype will go away when people find out they can’t use their bitcoin for shit
Yee have little faith in today’s adoption of tech... ordinary men on the streets already have smart phones. That’s all they need to open their own bank account and spend their value how they see fit.. this is possible today.. you are missing the big picture. Restricting growth on Bitcoin and pushing it towards a rich mans asset class is not going to help. This statement is valid today... yes and thankfully Bitcoin Cash is geared towards world adoption. Exciting times ahead.
[deleted]
I am acting like it can never be changed? Are you for real? Why don't you go say that to Bitcoin Core and Blockstream, see what they say. Yes, it technically can be changed but we all know it won't... and those of us not being ignorant know why.
"Jeez, why so aggressive? I never said that it didn't support BTC or that it supported BCH over BTC. What I meant was that Core supporters dislike the app and are submitting tons of 1-star astroturf reviews for it simply because it includes support for BCH and it accurately represents the name (as opposed to their rendition 'Bcash'). 

I use the app myself, I should know. Calm your tits."
"Using shapeshit website you basically specify the amount of coins (any coins they support, which you can check on their website) you want to exchange and for which coin... the site gives you address you need to send your coins you want to convert, you then specify your original address of the wallet in case something goes wrong so that they can refund it, and send that amount of coins to them, and specify to which address you want the new coin to be sent by shapeshit... with this wallet you can do all that without needing to specify addresses (I assume) as the wallet already has your addresses in it, and you don't need to use the shapeshift website.

I don't know what conversion shapeshit uses, but it should be same using the wallet or shapeshift website to convert. Using wallet will just be more convenient,"

"Great, but be careful how this is implemented - there are a lot of problems getting BTC TXs confirmed, without an exorbitant fee it could take forever, but then people could complain about the high fee.

There is really no way you can make working with BTC a great user experience at this point (except perhaps using your own pool as accelerator for bitcoin.com TXs as suggested)"

It creates option in Bitcoin.com wallet to exchange BTC to BCH (and maybe vice versa) directly within the wallet without need to use shapeshift website.

Shapeshift does not collect any info. You do not create an account to use the service 
"I've not heard that. But what info can they give on you besides an IP address and what coins your shifted. You don't create an account when you use shapeshift.

Changely on the other hand has you create an account"
I was asking more along the lines of everyday purchases. 
"No rush at all. It's amazing cryptos have made it this far. The growth of new ""users"" in the past year is somewhat of a phenomenon. Why not hold on to btc until transactions get situated?

Are you referring to cex? Seems like the best option so far. Didn't try shapeshift tho

The opposite. Changelly requires account while Shapeshift doesn't
"That's why it's callled shapeshift and not Backshift  - Back is always bad ;)"
The upcoming ShapeShift service for the wallet works both ways, i.e., BTC <----> BCH. 
Not sure yet.  I'm not sure why anyone would go in the other direction anyhow...
"Not to mention Shapeshift is known to comply with government requests for info.

Afaik Changely would be a much better privacy focused choice."
"Shapeshift is probably the best ""no frills"" exchange option there is, much older and more trustworthy than Changelly. Slightly more expensive, yes, but also way more reliable other than... well, when Bitcoin itself fails. If you happen to know a _third_ option that works better, I'm all ears."
satoshi dice, yours, tipper, etc.  more to come after bitpay integration for merchants.
