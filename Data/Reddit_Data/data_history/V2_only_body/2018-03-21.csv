The primary purpose of Ripple is less for everyday users and more as a transactional coin to support the Ripple blockchain network. The main intended users of XRP are the bank and other financial institutions using the Ripple blockchain to transfer funds. 
Don’t get it 
This is epically brilliant and captures exactly the problem in the crypto space as a whole.

Yes you are right :)
Riiiiight and let me guess... Bitcoin is privileged and bcash is oppressed.

"So if bitcoin raised its block size to 2mb next year and transaction fees stayed low would you drop support for BCH? It seems like a lot of the BCH support hinges entirely on the belief that BTC intends to sabotage on chain and is lying about wanting to raise the block size. What if the BTC roadmap is genuine?

Cartoons like the OP make it sound like BCH is doing something really sophisticated that the ""core jocks"" cannot comprehend but at the end of the day BCH is just raising the block size and assuming BTC never will. "
uh, 3-10 sat/byte working fine for me
"Why do you lie? Its not close to that, stop lying, its one of the reasons why people dont take bitcoin cash serious. 90% of this sub is toxic core bashing, stop doing that if you want to survive. Dont point out flaws in others, point out your own strenghts. 

Right now only the 0 confirmation is sort of a plus over bitcoin. Blocks are not full so not relevant because no one want to use it because you guys are all such toxic losers, you guys are the r/theredpill of crypto.

"not need to guess at anything I'm just projecting the social narrative that Blockstream project, that bitcoin is not for those who live on $2 a day or the 80% of the population who cant afford to use bitcoin because they earn less than $10 per day.

Bitcoin BCH includes them as opposed to excluding them. 

Bitcoin BTC used to be about banking the unbanked, it's now an exclusive Digital Gold SoV for the rich. "
"I wasn't talking about the lightning network that's different from the bitcoin network. None the less it's also exclusive more so than inclusive when looking at the global population as opposed to your tiny gender equality sample of 1 with 3 individuals from the upper middle class.

"The BTC / BCH cism is politically based. Not increasing the blocksize was a political move by the BTC side, disguised as a technical one. To many tears and sweat were spent trying to reach a compromise to no avail. And this is only one of the strokes that paint a bigger nasty picture:

...the systematic censorship, propaganda and smearing campaigns, the absolute centralization of development, betting the future in second layer very questionable pre-alpha solutions, ignoring the principles of utility first that made Bitcoin valuable, losing adoption, attacking the merchants, doing nothing positive about it, fatal contradictions in discourse regarding fees and being a store of value and everything else really...

It's just too many things that smell bad in the BTC camp, and wont change just with an increase of the blocksize (which will never happen). But in any case you don't suddenly regain like that all the confidence completely lost over years. That ship sailed and will never come back.

It's not about sophistication, it is about doing honest work, keeping the community open and infomed, allowing discussing all the things, being clear on what the objectives are, having a plan, having actual arguments for doing (or not doing) things, and above all making fucking sense.

That's the best of youtube, many vlogs are really scams like with the Bitconnect referral program.
More small miners can pool together if they can afford the near-zero fees. Small blocks cause mining centralization by cutting off anyone who mines less than 10x the fee.
"> Gigablocks are cool, but I believe they will further centralize mining

I think you don't understand modern mining.

Unless you are a very large mining operation, when you mine, you contribute hashpower to a pool. You do not yourself store or create blocks. The pool operator does that.  And pools are capable of following large blocks up to a very large scale.

Now there may be reason to fear mining centralization from pools, but large blocks aren't one of them.

On the other hand significant adoption thanks to larger blocks is a strong driver of decentralization...."
"> I want to see how LN plays out, especially now that the fees have dropped to normal levels again.

I want to see how LN plays out too, but I do not see what it has to do with Bitcoin scaling or why you're mentioning it along side larger blocks. It's not a scaling solution, sure it can handle some hypothetical business that may exist at some point in the distant future, but it has nothing to do with scaling. The only reason people would mention it along side, or as an alternative is if they have bought in to the propaganda, instead of doing their homework.

The main reason I want to see how LN plays out is because it'll be as disastrous as Theranos, but in public and with more people losing money. Great entertainment, that LN.

edit:
>Gigablocks are cool, but I believe they will further centralize mining.

People should be ashamed of posting such things with no proof."
"> I don't believe in big blocks as 'the' scaling solution,

why? 

based on what data?

"
"I hear this a lot about how larger blocks will “centralize mining” but I’m genuinely curious if this is true or if this is just a collective assumption like “the earth is flat”. 

From my recollection, the way bitcoin was designed there is a physically built-in mechanism, few people mention, that would encourage competition and discourage centralization. If we were to establish that the “currency” for miners were **hashrate/KWh** the current investment into hashrate/KWh would gradually decrease in value over time (Moore’s Law = depreciation and improvements in electric generation ensure this). Which would [should?] mean that an existing firm(s) with a net dominant hashrate/KWh **MUST** continuously invest in their infrastructure at ever lower operating costs in order to maintain their hashrate/KWh dominance. With blocks being “fair play” aka Bitcoin protocol is agnostic to who is awarded the next block reward. The protocol naturally prevents anti competitive behavior with their incentive structure (no inherent advantage other than hashrate/KWh giving you a higher probability of finding the next block). 

Knowing this mechanism and economic design how exactly does this result in centralization? Investments into improvements like ASICS and highly efficient hashrate/KWh should encourage competitive behavior not the other way around. At the end, even with fewer participants/firms, the incentive structure is for all actors to *play fair* as all participants have significant “skin in the game” and theoretically there should [would?] be a cooperative equilibrium (discourages foul play because why “kill the goose that lays everyones golden eggs”?). Decentralization is a trade off... the more participants... the more challenging it is to reach asynchronous consensus on the state. By lowering the barrier of entry aka “no skin in the game” (no stake) you encourage more malicious actors to participate meaning you need 2n+1 *good nodes* simply to **ensure** the safety and liveness of the network.

This really begs the question... what exactly are we trying to accomplish here? "
"> Actually, this just shows that the author acknowledges the fact that there are a lot of people in crypto right now who don't know what's what, and that a select few actually understand the protocol behind bitcoin.

I would like to point out that you fall into the category of not knowing what's what, because there really was never a debate and big blocks have always been the scaling solution. There being a ""debate"" was a forced narrative, and fact is actually that *no* discussion between two sides actually occurred.

And the reasons you give for why you believe it to be up to debate are actually non-reasons. It's been proven that up until 1gb blocks are absolutely perfectly sustainable in the long run and *don't* further centralize mining. This is what the gigablock testnet written on his shirt in the picture is referring to."
I think the centralization risk of LN is far greater than larger blocks. Hubs with higher liquidity will be able to handle more traffic and reap the lion's share of the LN fees. It's also impractical for many use cases as you'll still need 2 base layer transactions or you'll need to be willing to tie money up in a system that needs 24/7 monitoring. LNs = the new banks.
BTC fees are back to 300 Satoshi/Byte. Just to be clear, this is your definition of 'normal level fees'?
"> Gigablocks are cool, but I believe they will further centralize mining.

Well, let's move beyond beliefs into things we can test and measure. How do we measure centralization? How centralized is mining now? How centralized will it be with gigabyte blocks?

It seems like mining is already very centralized, and I think that larger blocks will increase centralization, but percentage-wise probably not much. But I don't have any hard numbers either."
Why do you believe it will centralise mining? So far it seems that centralisation due to blocksize is a complete myth. I still have not heard a consistent reason for why it would happen.
"> BTC intends to sabotage on chain

they have done that already


>lying about wanting to raise the block size

that *does appear* to be the case
"
"The reality is no one wants bigger blocks they are a result of more transactions which is a reflection of adoption and use.

The arguments presented in favor of limiting transaction capacity now and in the future are justified by statements like **I don't like** as opposed to objective evaluations. 

The image also presents an in-crowd, ""Crypto Jocks"" as conformist this is also representative of those who follow BS/Core they are the leaders. Fundamentalists call them the smartest guys in the room some of them self-identify as thought leaders."
It's an illustration.
Is that how BCH supporters see themselves. As a little clique of high school girls?  Jesus. 
You missed the BS/Core triple bottom. 
"There are definitely uninformed angry people on both sides. I also have trouble finding meaningful conversation, but do occasionally. I like to think that I know a reasonable amount about the subject. Feel free to ask questions.

LN is cool in theory, channels definitely work as promised between two people. The main problem is routing between millions of nodes. Centralization is likely to be the fix. Being able to run a full node on a PC would be nice, but I think it is too restrictive to throughput. 

Bitcoin Cash can definitely scale way beyond current usage. In my opinion block sizes that require server level hardware is not centralization as long as there is enough real adoption to provide incentives for full nodes. I feel like Bitcoin Cash developers are finally optimizing the software for on chain scaling, which has been shunned by BTC for a while."
"Twitter is a good place to stay current and find relevant and knowledgeable crypto ppl. YouTube and Medium are useful for opinions and info from people you find on Twitter and around the web, but the best place to start is the respective coin x-coin.org and x-coin-foundation.org websites for the coins you're interested in. 

Even after all that, you may end up still conflicted but at least you'll know what's what. Me? I could give a fuck what people call me. I'm thinking it might be time to put some ETH in the mix  https://i.imgur.com/koYDQKN.png

"
"You could ask the same in the reverse. It all depends on your perspective. For instance, some believe that BCH *is* the original bitcoin, thus LTC came after it. Or, some (more, likely), believe BCH came after LTC, and in that perspective your question is more relevant.

As crypto is valued based on who thinks it's valuable, one of the most significant things that one brings to the table vs another, is the community which supports it. Each are different, and have their own pros and cons."

I'm excited to see which currency is more resilient"
This pesky altcoin that keeps pretending like it’s bitcoin so that it’s biggest promoters can maximize gains before abandoning it entirely. Look at the chart and look at the timing of Roger’s propaganda campaigns and you’ll basically see how this coin works. Some people call that a pump and dump (times 4), but I’m not wed to any particular terminology myself.
Basically this is about physical means of expansion, like the stock market type of metrics but in different form, but same level of methods. Each fork has its own method for increasing value or whatever science is behind crypto currencies. I dunno how they all compare, i guess i should look into that more.... but i thought it was just plain and simple to what crypto currencies were to begin with. Just hashed up transactions. Kind of like a comparison to the computer the government has to find prime numbers. Except smaller but more vast, and turns up the unreal or real numbers of a shred of a transaction. Basically turning something intangible into something tangible. 
And satoshi like doge coin is comparing cents to dollars. 
Solve all, buy a little of all and diversify portfolio xD...... too much time spent in wsb.
Yes, a small minority of people will do that repeatedly.
"Yeah I’m not sure about the patents either, however. Doing my own research on CSW, he is either satoshi or very closely related (I would go as far as to believe that he is actually satoshi). I’m sure he has already thought out a path for the bitcoin protocol and the patents were always a part of the plan. So just sit back and wait for the shocker.

On the premise of a 51% attack and Russia spending 100M on mining. Bitmain has profited over 2B, CSW is probably in possession of over 1M BTC & 1M BCH, Mr Ver is probably in possession of a very large sum of BTC and BCH. Not to mention all others on BCH team. It takes capital to win all wars, I think the BCH team is in possession of some major capital if it comes down to defending an attack.

I mean of course its more than capital and you make good points, only time will tell. I think above all, the technology is world changing and that’s what people as a society need to focus on rather than destructive behavior. However, we most certainly need to have the security in place to prevent such malicious activity because of course someone will give it a shot if the door is open."
This is especially true in IT field. People have very poor loyalty, if a new product comes and does the job better, they will just switch over.
"> I disagree on them having nothing to lose. High transaction fees greatly restrict its viability as a currency.

Your first sentence here, that it greatly restricts its viability as a currency, is exactly why they're restricting the block size. In case you didn't know, core is corrupt by the banks and they do everything they do for the sake of maximum damage.

"haha, is what world is that the definition of money?

If you want to move your money with 10% of the protection as bitcoin: be my guest.

You are comparing moving gold yourself with all the risks with letting a professional security company move it. Its not the same product."
My only issue is that if its a pump and dump, why does it cost 1000$ a share, why do people keep posting that they used it to pay for things, why are there more posts saying retailers are accepting it, why are wallets carrying it. I mean it seems like institutions are accepting it more than bitcoin its self. 
">This pesky altcoin that keeps pretending like it’s bitcoin so that it’s biggest promoters can maximize gains before abandoning it entirely.

I have to remember to stop feeding the trolls. 
"I'd be interested in seeing that road map.

Anyway it's the investors who make or break the upgrade. Core are not opposed to a block size increase just limiting transaction capacity to 1MB.

"
"I disagree on them having nothing to lose. High transaction fees greatly restrict its viability as a currency and many early vendor BTC adopters have stopped using BTC or moved on to BCH. If the only thing BTC has going for it is that there's a limited supply available and barely any vendors, it makes no sense for anyone to be invested in it versus just adopting BCH (assuming no 51% attack, private key encryption being broken, etc).

It reminds me a lot of Yahoo vs Google in the early days when Yahoo was dominant but spent their money on other enterprises like Yahoo News, Movies, etc, while Google focused on just its search engine; we now know exactly who came out on top. In my opinion, the lesson is that if you can't provide people with the service that people ORIGINALLY came to you for, they WILL move on to someone else that can. 

Digression below:

But the LN! Yes I'm excited for it too but I don't have complete confidence in it yet due to the fact that payment channels must be pre-funded and finding paths with enough funds is very difficult if you're truly doing a decentralized node-network (for now anyway). Also not to mention that if you put a ton of BTC into a channel, you effectively have a hot wallet prime for cyber attacks. And of course there is the issue of closing a channel is still an on-chain transaction so if we ever go back to those silly $20 a transaction fee, it will undermine the whole system. 

Time will tell how robust and reliable the LN really is but if it fails for either technical or lack of adoption, they will have the option of increasing block size. And if they don't (while not having another solution to scaling), then BTC will go the way of Yahoo."
If BTC had raised the block size and kept fees low BCH wouldn’t even exist. If they did it next year? I don’t think they could without a chain split. They’ve spent so much time telling everyone hardforks are dangerous and Segwit+LN is the only scaling BTC needs, even if Core turned around and supported bigger blocks there would be a significant group who are so invested in the propaganda they would refuse to upgrade.

Bitcoin Core blocks are full. 

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/514440
Block 514440 had 0.17BTC in fees, or $1,426 USD for 1,687 transactions. 

All I asked is if this is your definition of normal fees? Is it?

You really need to chill out. Perhaps think a little before calling someone a liar. "

[deleted]
That’s like going back to an abusive spouse after they hit you for years. 
"I often thought the same exact thing, if I remember correctly, BTC wanted to optimize other scaling options prior to raising the blocksize limit. Which led me to the same conclusion that BCH wouldn’t have the same leverage.

However, CSW patents changes the game a long with as others state, how BTC goes about running their version of the Bitcoin protocol with not allowing open discussion, that’s unintuitive for the long run.

I do believe that both can coexist and that the possible reasoning for BTC actions is that their vision is to comply with governing regulations to be the choice for cooperations/etc.. moving forward. 

Edit: to clarify, by BTCs vision to be the choice for governing bodies. I mean that by using solutions like the lightning network, you force the fees away from miners and into hubs on the lightning network, which may not seem like a big deal at the moment. However, in the future if LN needs centralized liquidity hubs in order to function on a world scaling level. I would assume it would be in governing bodies best interests to be those liquidity hubs. "
"This is my biggest concern of BCH. It hinges on BTC not raising the blocksize and continuing to believe in high transaction fees. If BTC team gets an epiphany tomorrow and suddenly says ""Wait a minute, what if we had bigger block size AND lightning network!?"", BCH would be in real deep doop. On the other hand, a surprising amount of infrastructure has already shifted away from BTC over to BCH as vendors support BCH over BTC so they still have that leverage going on.

So you would be correct, the only benefit BCH has over BTC is the blocksize increase. However given the rate of vendor adoption, it would be possible for BCH to be so entrenched in our economy that people would be reluctant to move back over to BTC even if BTC raises the blocksize. 

EDIT: Guys, stop downvoting the guy above me. LN vs Block Size increase are two legitimate engineering attempts to solve the Bitcoin scaling problem. Technically /u/172 is right even if his tone is condescending. "
I have asked the same question myself (about the possibility of a bigger block size and that LN routing is solved). I disagree that the only thing BCH has over BTC is simply a blocksize increase.
"> even if Core turned around and supported bigger blocks there would be a significant group who are so invested in the propaganda they would refuse to upgrade.

How would it be reversing course to do what they said they would do? A block size raise has been on the roadmap. The theory in this sub is that its a lie. This is curious to me since most core developers supported a block size publicly before segwit and have had it in long term plans the whole time."

"You can get your transaction included for 1 satoshi atm, and if you want be be included in the next block for sure, 20-30 is enough to guarantee that. There are some wallets like jaxx who are fucked up and charge higher fees, but that is not bitcoins fault, that is just a shitty wallet.

Yes, I think its very normal to pay a few cents or a dollar or so when I move funds on the most secure blockchain there is, you keep forgetting that bch only has ~10% of the hashpower. A big btc miner can destroy bitcoin cash at every moment they want. BCH is cheaper because its a less used, less secure, inferior product in comparison to BTC.



You are cherrypicking and lying. Every person who is in between in the blockdebate and reads statements like yours, can easily check it, call you out and just disregard BCH completely because most of you are all lying with your extreme statements.

People like you dont get it, you wont win with lying, you wont win with taking over a bitcoin sub, you wont win by abusing the bitcoin twitter or bitcoin.com. Its all the same fraudulent and toxic behavior. 

Worst thing is that without Roger bch price would be 0.000001 btc or so and less and less people take him serious the more he goes on.

What's bcash?
"One thing to note: many of the most prominent bitcoin early adopters heavily support BCH. Think on that one....... do you think they would abandon the concept they fell in love with?

In terms of ""penny stock"", low-liquidity cryptos are more like that. BCH is one of the larger market caps, with a (relatively speaking) more stable price."
"I do not claim to know the makeup of this subreddit, so I can't comment on that really. Bitcoin, and perhaps crypto as a whole, is torn about how to scale. Ethereum wants to try more experimental methods like sharding and possible POS mining. Bitcoin wants to try an experimental solution like LN. Bitcoin Cash wants to increase the blocksize.

Note how you do not see any Ethereum trolls coming in here and disparaging the Bitcoin Cash community, it's only Bitcoin that does that. At first glance this seems odd as both BTC and ETH desperately need to scale and are directly competing with BCH for users, so why don't we see ETH trolls coming in here? Simple, BCH doesn't compete with ETH for hashrate and the BCH scaling solutions don't work for ETH. BCH scaling solutions do work for BTC now, but they're not pursuing it so they're trying to prevent BCH from doing so."
"The r/bitcoin subreddit is heavily moderated (censored) by the Blocksteam Corp. funded Bitcoin Choir. 

This subreddit is maintained by the original BTC promoters, who now maintain BCH, who apparently seem less threatened by opinions and discussions that are allowed to take place here  "
And sadly, this happens all the time..
"I'm not really sure what the CSW patents really are, exactly what they're patenting, or its long term effects. It seems very strange to me that anything Bitcoin related could involve patents.


On the note of miners, as much as I dislike fees, the entire security of the BT network relies on having a high hash rate to deter attackers. Offchain scaling solutions would still require the chain itself to be secure so if miners begin to drop out due to low profitably, it could seriously compromise the system. This feels like one of those ""We want low fees AND high hash rate"" paradoxes where a compromise must be met. (Personally I'm rooting for some magical not-yet-discovered PoW algorithm that's going to drastically reduce mining electricity costs but still be secured by some giant consensus)



[If this website is correct,](https://fork.lol/), then BCH only has ~12% of the total hashrate BTC has which makes me sweat bullets. Somewhere earlier on Reddit I remember reading a response to a 51% BCH attack: ""lol you'd have to spend $60 million dollars on mining equipment to pull it off,"" except didn't Russia just invest $100 million into mining infrastructure during the summer of last year? BCH is still well within the limit of an attack from a sovereign power or giant pools. Not to fear-monger but I think it's important for people to understand this vulnerability does exist and is far from impossible, unlike a 51% attack on BTC, possible but highly improbable. 

I just had the craziest idea, what if people just mined BCH from their computer, not for the sake of profit but for the sake of communal security? It's just a deterrence in the end, like arming your civilians. You do enough of that and it'll seriously deter external attackers."
Why would they though? Core will always have nothing to lose and everything to gain from restricting the block size.

"Actually, this just shows that the author acknowledges the fact that there are a lot of people in crypto right now who don't know what's what, and that a select few actually understand the protocol behind bitcoin. 

That said, I don't believe in big blocks as 'the' scaling solution, and prefer other options over it. The scaling debate was never about moon-lambo-bois vs. big blocks, it was about sustainability in the long run. Gigablocks are cool, but I believe they will further centralize mining. I want to see how LN plays out, especially now that the fees have dropped to normal levels again."

"**Grandiose delusions**

Grandiose delusions (GD), delusions of grandeur, expansive delusions also known as megalomania are a subtype of delusion that occur in patients suffering from a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including two-thirds of patients in manic state of bipolar disorder, half of those with schizophrenia, patients with the grandiose subtype of delusional disorder, and a substantial portion of those with substance abuse disorders. GDs are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent, wealthy, or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic and typically have a religious, science fictional, or supernatural theme. There is a relative lack of research into GD, in contrast to persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations.

"I'm against core, and a big blocker for pragmatic reasons, but some things they say make sense.  For example, I have trouble dismissing this claim:

""The demand for externalized-cost highly replicated external storage at price zero is effectively infinite.""

That actually makes sense to me, so I see where that reasoning could lead you to want a fee-market to develop. 

For both core and cash forks, I don't see a real solution to the long-term infinite growth of the blockchain. If the blockchain is water pouring from a faucet into a sink with no drain, slowing the water (segwit and lightning) doesn't solve the problem. Expanding the sink doesn't quite do it either. Wouldn't adding a drain (snapshots) be a more permanent solution?

Time flies by. 
">You are being intentionally dense. His point was not whether there was a standing policy prohibiting it.
>
>His point was that they did absolutely nothing to stop it. Don’t pretend you don’t understand his point. You do.

You seem to be misreading both the user's post and my response to it. KeepingTrack stated that there were listings which led to ""allegations of pedophilia sales, and murder for hire""  - I stated that this was absolutely untrue, because there were **no** allegations nor charges of pedophilia sales listings nor murder for hire listings. I then asked them to link to the government's prosecution documents which mention such listings. I provided a $100 in BCH reward for this because I know that they do not exist, so my BCH is completely safe and the user's blatant trolling would become obvious when they cannot back up their claims.

You also seem to have no idea of the side effects of the vendor bond system which actually did prevent such listings from appearing in the first place. I explain this below.

>Like he said. There could’ve been a simple word filter to block it out in search.

I'm not sure why you're bringing up a word filter to block something out through the search function when a word filter would not have been required because such listings did not exist, and therefore a search would have returned no results.

The reason for the above is that Silk Road was not a marketplace where anybody could simply post a listing. A user had to pay a 'vendor bond' in order to upgrade their account which would make it an exercise in losing money to spend hundreds of Dollars to upgrade an account simply to create a listing for something as wholly reviled as child pornography, or indeed a 'hitman for hire' listing, and lose the vendor bond as soon as it was spotted - something which would have happened as soon as site staff scanned listings, which itself is something that occurred numerous times daily.

There were also report functions which allowed users to report vendors for any reason they felt necessary.

>They didn’t even bother to do that.

You're in no position to state that as a fact; Silk Road expressly prohibited and actively removed anything related to pedophilia and murder both on the marketplace and discussion forums. Accounts were banned straight off the bat for such posts on the discussion forums, and 'digital goods' vendors who advertised their listings for pennies did not risk the funds they had tied up in their vendor bond by creating a listing for banned items."
[deleted]
You were a vendor blahblahblah.
"You are disgusting liar. Any actual user of the site knows that even carding and firearms were removed, let alone pedophilia. Fucking maddening that you can blatantly promote misinformation to purport your shitty agenda. ""You were a vendor"", post proof then, but I won't hold my breath."
You're naïve if the you think the courts have anything to do with discovering the truth.  The fact that evidence can be disallowed is proof of that. It's a game with a set of rules like everything else, it has nothing to do with truth.

what we do know is it was never tried and he's been in there for 5 years now."
"> Is it or is it not true that he did it?

Are you expecting people on reddit to know the answer? This is why we have trials, not just asking the public."
He has not been found guilty by a jury, so legally speaking it is at most alleged. Allegations are not enough to sentence.
An agent in the investigation went rogue and was actually charged and is now in jail. It's almost impossible to know if that stuff was real or if it was part of this rogue agent's plan to hide his tracks.
Paid political shills out in force, must be threatened by Liberty and Bitcoin Cash.  We must be on the right path.
The silk road didn't have credit cards or hitmen, it was purely for drugs. The whole point of the site was that anything that could be used to harm others was banned.
You clearly never used silk road lmao
Then why are drugs illegal on a federal level?  There is no authorization in the constitution for the government to prohibit drugs.  Those states have their own constitutions as well.  The law is a facade, and has no substance behind it.
"Yeah, I'm something of a statist. A free western style democracy is the best system we have invented and is the preferable one until we can reach some kind of post-scarcity utopia. By living in a society you have to realistically accept that the some laws will exists that you will follow even if you find them morally wrong. It's impossible to have a moral compass completely aligned with a system as large as a state. It's completely justified to fight unjust laws with the tools that your society gives you. And if you live in a society that don't have ways for the people to change the laws then you are oppressed and your actions to free yourself becomes a lot more justified.

Now I personally feel that the laws that Ross and Roger have broken are morally justified laws and as such breaking those are both illegal and morally wrong."

"Even if he hired them - thought I don't buy it - in other countries this would result in rather low sentences. In Germany he either would have never been put in jail or he'd be released after 10 years. 
I bet my ass Ross was f* by the officials just to send a message to 'all those darknet criminals', not realizing that most of those are just ordinary people who pay their taxes. FBI is becomming less and less trustworthy. It's a shame and this process and what followed just made it more visible. Ross was ahead of his time. Free markets are not stoppable. Rather then trying to shut them down gov. should discuss what to do to make them unnessecary. Cimes commited by gov. officials and bankers that had a actual negativ impact on millions of people went uncharged and a guy that - highly questionable - wrote a message on the internet that resulted in absolutely nothing went to jail for lifetime. It's a fucking joke. History will reveal what officials and who exactly ordered this. For what it's worth: if law was bent or broken by anyone in this process those people and their family names will be remembered as the fuckers they are. It's no different to Göbbels or Himmler."
"You dissolve any risks at all of being shot, stabbed or robbed whether you're the guy or the dealer.

Silkroad undoubtedly saved lives, you cannot deny that. "
I heavily advocate against hard drugs of any sort purely because of principle and past experiences with friends, but his market was not only for heroin, it also provided valuable medicine that is/was far to expensive to obtain in the USA among other things. While I do hate some of the kinds of drugs that were sold on there for the damage they inflict on society, it should be noted that he created a marketplace that allowed users to acquire drugs in a far safer and more reliable manner, which reduces the violence and overdoses we currently see plaguing the nation. While I do understand your point of view, I don't really find any of what he said delusional given the statement and his history.
I think it is more the fact that users logged into his account after he was already incarcerated multiple times and the fact that two agents also have been convicted after the fact that we're involved and had access. Not really defending his alleged actions, but I understand the skeptisism surrounding the case.
Quit talking to yourself.

Like with Aaron Swartz... it's not ""the government"" that killed him. Carmen and Stephen killed Aaron. Those two will hide behind ""we were protecting the public, law, America, little kids, etc""... but if they were better people, they would've came clean and accepted responsibility.

"it was dropped because he was already told to be given life... there is a legal concept of ""dont load everything into the canon"" the idea is if your original case brought to court doesnt stick, you can still try for the other provable things."

Wait, so it's like I do a hit and run, and then the cops allege it was intentional murder without any proof, and I get a murder 1 charge sentance, but found guilty of a hit and run?
If found guilty in a proper trial, then yes. The gov needs to follow its own system though. Neither public nor political opinion belong in that verdict.
Good thing chat logs can't be faked.
Yeahhhhh... Not sure why people in this thread are treating him like a freedom fighter
"Facilitating drug dealing and usage obviously.

What's so noble about creating an underground market for heroin?"
Well given that people were logging into the Dread Pirate Roberts account days after Ulbricht was in custody, it seems difficult to prove that he was the one who sent that specific message. Especially when two DEA agents with access to that account have since been jailed in relation to the case.
The allegations of ordering murders was never substantiated. He was not convicted of this, and it was removed from his indictment. Don't you think they would have kept that in if true? That this continues to be repeated seems highly manipulative, and was a lever used to get and keep him in prison.
If you havent seen this documentary, give it a watch before it gets removed again.

Obviously prohibition has been a failure, but our legal system is more than a single document. It seems pretty likely to me that the tenth amendment left the power to ban drugs to the state, and the federal government is pretty good at coercing states to follow their will, or lose federal funding.

"who cares about drugs?

Its not about drugs. Real criminals, hitmen, murderers were trading on the site. stealing credit card numbers and shit. the fact that drugs were sold there doesnt make any difference. there was tons of shady shit on the site, plain as night and day. worst types of crimes were supported by the site.

"I'm an anarchist so I don't really think anything should be prohibited in the way that it is now.  

The bigger issue with prohibitions beyond my personal dislike of them is that they don't actually work.  I of course don't want to see wide spread usage of heroin, but I also don't believe that prohibition will effectively prevent it, in fact I see it as a contributing factor in the problem.  If we really care about fixing the heroin problem we should be looking at what the US government has done in Afghanistan.  The timing of it's incursion there and the rise of heroin usage in the US is not coincidence."
I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm against drug prohibition in general both because I'm ideologically opposed to government having a say over what drugs are legal and not, but also because it isn't effective in solving drug problems.  
Equating running a black market website with nazism is pretty silly.

"If the so called public servants would actually serve the people like they are supposed to, there would be no issue.

Sadly neither the US nor Germany are democracies but rather corporatist federal Republics.

Basically actually governing a country is pretty hard so the political cast is relying on financial and practical help from lobbying groups.

In the legislation process it is common practice to consider the interests of relevant lobbying groups as well as relying on their expertise. 

Though not a gov, but a multinational organisation, interpol is incredibly corrupt because they have to rely on money from the private sector and donations from certain countries.

As you can see there's an obvious conflict of interest rooted within what we call the most functional democracies when so called public servants are mainly being influenced by interest groups which of course are only representing the interests of whatever particular group they stem from.

Public servants swear to serve the people not a small group of people with the loudest voices and the most money. "
"True, but the murder for hire charge was dropped from the incitement (and 5 more unfiled at all apparently), yet he seemed to have been punished for all of it anyway. 

It isn't over yet though, there are many legal groups working to overturn this heinously unjust punishment.

Dude, seriously you have to up your debate skills. Speeding is also not in the constitution. As  a matter of fact, neither is murder."
So your assertion is that nothing decided by a majority vote could ever be unfair?
some, maybe. what is reasonable though? He has been in there five years already...
You do realize just because the word drug can mean both heroin and aspirin, there is a slight difference between the two.
I'm making a comparison, just because he's not selling the drugs on the streets doesn't make him less responsible, he's still responsible. 
The constitution is a poor document to read if you want to justify these laws. You have to look to the cases which have hugely distorted and undermined the constitution to understand what is going on.

I stated that Ross Ulbricht is nothing but an attempted murderer and convicted drug dealer, which is a true statement. He is nothing but a glorified convicted criminal and it disgusts me that he's placed on a pedestal by this sub. Your reply was that I'm 'spouting nonsense' while ignoring the actual statements I made. Yes you are being ridiculous.
"Sure they did. The same goes with me stopping pointing people at THW and similar sites -- they refused to police their own shit well enough and instead supported pedophiles and other trash. 

The only reason I even know what happened is from reading articles years later. I wasn't doing any high volume in sales and that wasn't a primary source of income for me, unlike the shitheads selling fentanyl, meth and the like. Like I said, I was selling legal items. Not caring about social costs, and drug dealing, and facilitating such transactions go hand in hand."

He's not in prison for taking drugs. You don't know about the interstate commerce clause and you conflate running a marketplace for illicit goods with an individual consuming drugs. You're gonna go far!

There have been countless examples of societies where the practice and the actual word of law differed greatly. So, no, neither you nor I have any idea nor any way to even get an idea of how society worked under the actual implementation of Hammurabi.

Whether or not they were playing whackamole with the users selling it or not, or offering hitman services on site, or those offering worse isn't really up for debate. Nothing addressed it to make it go away and a simple word-based filter would've. The priority always was money for Ross and whomever else was involved. Which is why he got caught with his pants down in regards to computer security. I reported it to them, and that lack of care and action is what disgusted me with the site.

"There is evidence that he ordered the hits, but there is no evidence that they were ever carried out.  Personally, I highly doubt they were.  I think the ""hitmen"" he hired were just scammers.

Nonetheless, I do believe that he should be punished for it.  He *wanted* and actively *tried* to have people killed in an effort to preserve himself.  If he hadn't done that, then maybe I would feel sorry for him.  But knowing that, I just can't."
"It's no doubt that this case is a complete shitshow. The agents doing the investigations have gotten away with some clearly criminal behavior. I think part of the reason why the attempted murder charges and the like were never really brought up is that it would make public too much of the shit the agents were doing.

There's no doubt in my mind however that Ross tried to have people killed due to them threatening his criminal empire. I personally don't think drugs should be illegal but trying to murder people absolutely should.

Ross is a bad person and he should be in jail. The reasons why he's currently sentenced to jail are likely wrong and the entire thing has been handled with a total disregard to proper legal procedures."

I also believe it is merely coincidental that this made some things safer. I am 99.999999999% certain he didn't start by saying ""I'm going to build a place to make sure drug addicts can at least get safe drugs, even if they just can't beat their addiction.""

I can't say I entirely disagree with the sentiment, the way he did get caught was pretty dumb from an op-sec perspective considering he was knowingly doing something illegal.
They are antiquated laws. I mean look how many states have legalized both medical and recreational use of marijuana despite it being federally illegal. Clearly the will of the people aren't being matched on a federal level. 
"How should such a scenario look like?

The agent somehow put a Trojan on Ulbricht's laptop to modify the chat logs, so it would look like Ulrbricht was DPR, when in reality he was just a regular Silk road user? Must be a pretty 1337 agent then. Also, Ulbricht initially denied even having anything to do at all with Silk Road. Hardy credible.

Or should the agent have bribed the investigators to put the files on his laptop after they seized it?

Even if, how should that help the agent? The chat logs don't say the agent is innocent. Unless your theory is that the agent is DPR.

Of course that's not the only evidence. Matching the timing of Ulbricht's activity with DPR's, the tech questions that Ulbricht asked on forums, bragging about his economic simulation marketplace on Linkedin..

The second won't happen without a change with the first. The internet is still vulnerable enough to be taken down, the last possible defence of any government of stopping crypto.

maybe I'm ignorant on this topic, but wasn't his crime trying to hire hitmen to literally kill people?
"He got the same length of sentence as a [mass murderer](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-scott-dekraai-sentencing-20170922-story.html). It is pretty clear the system made an example of him and basically gave him a sentence for 6 murder-for-hires that he was not in fact prosecuted for (1 charge was dropped from the indictment, the other 5 were never filed).

"
"It would probably have been considerably lower if he cooperated, but he chose to keep telling BS. 

His laptop was hacked, someone else put the chat logs in there.. plausible 4 sure /s"
And the (true, I saw the listings) allegations of pedophilia sales, and murder for hire -- you think it's all made up? Please.
Probably not for him though. 
What a delusional loser. Nice thoughts if you ignore what exactly he was doing.
At least he can't attempt to have people murdered anymore, we're safe from him now.
I want to know this too
"serious question: how is this person a **hero**?

have not looked closely at it personally, but what I gleaned from media was he founded and was running an ""anonymous"" market, with the intent to make a bunch of money, and a ton of shady stuff went down on the market including hiring people for murders, and the legal system made an example of him.  While they couldn't pin the murder-for-hires on him, there's no dispute the system he build enabled that, correct?

what parts of this story are wrong/missing, and what other parts support ""hero""?

genuinely interested in context and the larger story here
"
I agree. I don’t understand why people here are praising him
Pharmacies and GlaxoSmithKlien are drug dealers too
Its his trial that was unfair, and the judicial process. The judge was so out of touch with technology that he believed that if Ulbrict was near an old school telephone, he could send special messages with his voice that could hack the system.

Colorado maximum security 
the murder for hire allegations were never part of any court proceeding. 
That seems highly unlikely to me, unless you have a source I don't
Because many people feel the law is unfair.  The world envisioned by Ulbricht includes decentralized currency and free trade, two of the most powerful forces that can lead to a peaceful, prosperous, and generally unified world.  Laws are getting in the way of people trading freely.
If you're going to lock people up for being dumbasses, you're going to need more jails.
There's freedom... within the constraints of the law.

"FFS at some of the comments here. Yes Ulbricht has been in prison for five years, but that's not an extreme result. People can argue in good faith about whether the murder for hire allegations should have been raised (it is common for sentencing to consider charges that did not result in a conviction, and I agree with those who think the practice is unconstitutional*), but Ulbricht's conduct clearly fell within the Federal Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute. 

Ulbricht committed a continuing series of felony violations of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. He did so in concert with 5 or more people. He was the head of the conspiracy and he obtained substantial income or resources from the drug violations. I don't believe any of this is seriously in question.

As such, the mandatory minimum sentence is 20 years. None of the other allegations surrounding Ulbricht factor in to that-his conduct falls squarely into the drug kingpin statute. One can buy into every one of the arguments Ulbricht raised as mitigation in his sentencing hearing, and 20 years would STILL be the minimum sentence.

I'm sure I'll be downvoted to Hades for this, but if you disagree, I challenge you to reply with an argument rooted in the law instead of in policy. ""Bitcoin is freedom!"" isn't a legal argument, and I argue that crypto has nothing to do with Ulbricht's conduct meriting a hefty Federal prison sentence under existing law.

I'll briefly address the life sentence-yes. It was harsh. Yes-there was room to exercise discretion in either direction, and I actually agree that the life sentence was too much. I'd have preferred something in the lower range of the sentencing guidelines, keeping in mind, again, that the lower range starts at 20 years. But note that the level of money that Ulbricht earned through the Silk Road was itself sufficient to potentially receive a life sentence under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute. He was the leader of a criminal enterprise that generated at least 10 million dollars in gross profit in a single year--the prosecutors didn't press this point, but they could have, and had they done so, the mandatory minimum would have been a life sentence. And again, that doesn't bring in any of the allegations of murder for hire or overdose deaths of Silk Road users or criminal conduct of the investigating Federal agents or the allegations of judicial bias against him. That's just based on what seems to be the undisputed facts. (And again, sure, mandatory minimums are bad policy and I'm not a fan of them, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that they are not unconstitutional, and so changes require legislation. Ulbricht has been treated harshly but not any more unfairly than any other criminal defendant in his position.)

"> “Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn’t I wouldn’t impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally. I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I’ve always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit. Besides that, I don’t want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.

> More importantly, money is powerful, and it’s going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see. Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what’s already been created here.

> All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference. As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people. It’s fulfilling to me. If you don’t know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you. There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren’t hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself. It’s paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on others’, the happier you’ll be. Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish. :)”

"I accept he committed a crime; but the sentence applied feels a far greater crime."
Very good point. For the things he was actually put on trial for the sentence is beyond ridiculous. 
When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.  Ross is a hero and pioneer of Bitcoin and Liberty. Its fearless people like him, willing to risk everything for Liberty that made Bitcoin into what it is today.  One day with the help of Bitcoin to change this society, we will regain Liberty, and people like him will be freed from their cage.
Looks like a bunch of people on here gargle fox news type rhetoric. What a shame. I'm obviously too generous in thinking that most people here are intelligent. 
He was not the one running Silk Road. Simply helped start it and was setup to be the fall guy.
Why is it unfair that he's imprisoned? Didn't he run and maintain Silk Road, which had over 1.2 billion dollars in sales of illegal drugs/whatever else? Why is it not just? I'm actually curious if I'm missing something.
He's fucking guilty as shit. get over it.

Ross Ulbricht was nothing but a facilitator of drug dealing. There was absolutely nothing good about this guy. There are a lot of people worth of remembrance in history and this guy sure as fuck isn't one of them."
It’s hard to feel sorry for the guy when he ordered numerous hits. Completely unfair the way he was sentenced...but hard to feel sorry for someone who wants to harm others
Good. When you aid and abet murderers and pedophiles, this is where you end up. Fuck you, Ross.

yo free ross now.
I’ve always felt so bad for his guy. Yes, he fucked up and the murder for hire stuff was beyond reproach, but I mean damn. Anytime I feel like my life is going bad, I just think about how hard the government fucked this kid over. It’s really sad and so very few actually know about it. 
Ross would definitely appreciate receiving letters letting him know we haven't forgotten about him.
Dude should be in a Camp, not a USP. Regardless, I’ll be writing him. This man changed my life.
Why the FUCK is he in a USP?? That’s like max of max for the most violent.
Nice guy, sad to see his life destroyed in such a way. I bet if he was returned to society now he would give a lot of good back.

I won't argue with you about kingpin laws, but I would say that people who have done far worst are walking around free. 

Obviously I don't believe the legal system is fair, but if you want to argue whether it was severely illegal or not, then yeah what he did was severely illegal. I think just most people here think that illegal doesn't mean it was wrong or he hurt anyone. Many libertarians believe what people put in their bodies should just be their own choice. 

You can disagree or agree with that, but trying to say what he did was life imprisonment under federal law is missing the point of most of the people who believe Ross was treated unfairly are trying to get at."

"""Many libertarians believe what people put in their bodies should just be their own choice.""

And that's where it's societies job to say, ""No, it's not your choice if you are going to become a thorn in the side of the rest of us.""

We know the effects that drugs have on society. It's not positive and society is right to regulate things that may harm in. I'm not talking weed of course, I'm talking hard drugs. If libertarians want to be able to do heroin, that's fine, and in that case how about we just create an island with unlimited heroin and addicts can figure out how to build their own society and function with 100% heroin usage."

Why did prohibition of alcohol (another drug) need a constitutional amendment, but the prohibition of drugs did not need an amendment?  It seems to me the highest law of the land, the constitution does not permit government to ban substances, and history of alcohol prohibition shows that.  So people have been brainwashed about what the actual law is.

"Since I was a vendor selling legal items on SR, and saw the pedo listings that are referenced, for one, yeah, I totally do. 

I'm not going into other details, but there's more than enough evidence to convict him and keep him where he is, permanently. He was happy to turn a blind eye to sex trafficking, pedophilia, and murder, much less the social cost of the amounts of meth, opiates and worse on SR.
 "
"Nah, there were plenty of listings that would pop up repeatedly, sell quickly, pop up again in the months before the site went down. The pedo shit was going on in the same section of the site where hard drives full of TV, movies and books were being sold. The limited moderation and administration that SR had was even further confused by hidden areas and features of the site.

The human trafficking, and murder-for-hire shit were on SR and elsewhere as well.

"Additionally: 

an independent marketplace with customerreviews and merchant accountability => better quality of drugs, meaning better health for some people.

And doing so in a way which makes it harder to get arrested and hurt for doing something that should never be illegal in the first place= saved people problems in the form of : criminal record, money charged by the police and time in prison."
It’s like Robin Hood. Glorification of the outlaw.
This is just a bad argument. And the tobacco/alcohol is legal and marijuana isn't a good argument either. While it be true, its irrelevant. Two wrongs don't make a right. Just because these things are legal and they're bad, doesn't mean that we should make other drugs that could be bad legal as well. If tobacco and alcohol was illegal, would you be satisfied? Doubtful.
Legally. Small difference.
Also alcohol and tobacco are drugs that are legal in many countries and are responsible for more deaths than all other drugs combined. 
But yes, pill mill shady as fuck doctors belong in prison too.
so are we sending a nice postcard to every drug dealer behind bars? Im not saying no, Im just checking
"I think you guys are overestimating power of crypto. Lots of fighting that's ahead of us will be VERY unfair. Kinda like what Ross faced. 

If you poll general population, vast majority of people will tell you that he got ""what he deserved"". If that documentary is true - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gko-CkD85Xs - (and to me it seems it is) then I also am with Ross until the point where he orders murders. That's where two of us part ways. It is still victimless crime considering he was practically entrapped by government agencies... but he is definitely not innocent."
https://youtu.be/F1Ka0MDu9mE
I guess i shouldn't be surprised that even in /btc there will be the ignoramus. 
The murder for hire accusation was not part of Ross's formal charges and was never subject to real scrutiny in court. It was simply insinuated by the prosecution to make Ross look bad.
No, he was never actually charged and brought to trial on the hitmen. They used this information to justify giving him life. This will be the basis for appeal and hopefully will be seen by the supreme court. You cannot impose a harsher sentence, based upon something that wasn't brought charges against
"> His laptop was hacked, someone else put the chat logs in there.. plausible 4 sure /s

You do realize one of the agents in the investigation went rogue and is also in jail because of it right? All of these things are 100% plausible if the agent was trying to cover his tracks.

The truth is it was a completely fucked up investigation and no one knows the truth who wasn't directly involved.
"
No he wasn't charged for that, however they blamed several drug deaths on him saying that without silkroad these people wouldn't have had easy access to these drugs. Only in USA does something like that fly.
In chat logs he paid for 6 hits (which never took place because he was unknowingly speaking to an undercover agent), which are verified on the blockchain.  I don't think his jailtime is for that.  But in my opinion, for that, he deserves significant jailtime, if not life.  If I have the facts wrong, someone please correct me.
That what he was trialed or convicted for.
"I think this is a somewhat reasonable point. I'm all for decriminalizing drugs but if you're going to poke a hornet's nest for large quantities of money, don't be too surprised if you get stung.

I mean, it's not like Roger's case where they went after him out of proportion for the crime and where they were not prosecuting others for the same infraction. Governments have been going after organizations and individuals associated with illegal drugs for a long time."
Yeah like you know the truth and no one else does 
"> maybe I'm ignorant on this topic, but wasn't his crime trying to hire hitmen to literally kill people?

I'm pretty sure the government's goal is for people to be ignorant.  Ulbricht was never tried for these crimes, and the evidence was never presented, but they were happy to air all this crap in public to try to get him convicted in the court of public opinion.

I'm pretty sure it's all made up.  What the judge actually said was that Ulbricht's attitude toward the government could not be tolerated, and that is apparently why he got such a heavy handed sentence."
because alex winter made a documentary which was mainly influenced by ross' parents. and so obviously it was biased, but bitcoiners believe it
That's what I thought...
i hate to be this person but i think he deserves som jail time simply for being a dumbass.
That was not what he was convicted of his convictions are unrelated.
"You didn't see any listing, quit your bullshitting.

the murder for hire bit was through messaging not a listing. it was banned from the site and would have never happened if not for the involvement of an agent who used it as part of a plot to steal and extort money from the site.

There was never pedophile crap on the site, it just wasn't aimed at that crowd. Other sites existed for that. One of the main ones, playpen, was also run by feds. 

Both subjects were banned on his market from day one. It's pretty obvious what his image of the site was, the whole intention was non violent."
cold but tru
"That is absolutely untrue; it is public knowledge, and indeed has been stated in evidence, that pedophilia and murder for hire were explicitly prohibited on Silk Road.

>allegations of pedophilia sales, and murder for hire

Can you link us to the charges where these allegations are set out in government documents prosecuting Ross Ulbricht? Specifically where the government states that pedophilia and murder for hire were both for sale on Silk Road? No, of course you can't, because such listings did not exist on Silk Road.

However, I'll provide a little incentive for you to try back up your trolling - I'll send $100 in BCH to a BCH address of your choice if you can provide us all here with a link to the government's prosecution documents (and specifying the location of the text in those documents) which mention listings for pedophila and murder for hire being sold on Silk Road."

>It never sat well with me that it is possible to buy up all the land.

Nobody has bought up 'all the land'. That's why we have nation states, where a collective body of people share the same land and make rules within their territory (countries) that allows people within that jurisdiction to earn land for themselves (buying property). If some other governing body wants that land they need to take it by force or by agreement (war/annexation).

Who do you think should decide who is allowed to use and get any land? What makes YOU more deserving of a particular piece of land, than somebody else?"
BitcoinCashKing, I have news for you. Reddit is a drop in the bucket. The communities r/bitcoin, and r/btc, while they are entertaining, don't really mean all that much. They certainly in no way represent the majority of users
"You can't read? What are you getting at? 

Here is his complete statement:
=================================
""For the first 7 years or so, BTC was what was described in the Satoshi White Paper. With that formula it became a world wide phenomenon. In the last year and a half it became something completely different than what it was the first 7 years. BCH still has the same formula that made BTC a world wide phenomenon. That is why I'm now much more bullish on BCH than BTC. (The empirical evidence of a 7 year track record)""
==================================

Now, we can see that he states in the first 7 years or so, BTC followed the white paper, and it became a worldwide phenomenon. 

Then he says, in the last year and a half, it became different, not the whitepaper.

He says he is more bullish on BCH, because it follows the whitepaper, aka the first 7 years of btc, and that it become a worldwide phenomenon. 

I simply point out how this is great marketing. Because bitcoin was a larger phenomenon when it had its bull run to 20k, thus invalidating his statement

"
Nobody is preventing you from speaking. You can think as you wish, not everyone is going to agree with you. Do I really have to explain to you how free speech works? I know you are a troll so not going to waste my time.

Because it's inflammatory in the way you say it. Similar to how Nazis say Jews control the world.
"The commons belong to everybody.

What gives *you* the right to exclusively control a specific piece of land?

The standard answer I have seen is that making improvements gives you that right. However, the animals may make land improvements as well. That does not prevent them from being evicted by force.

Late edit: I think this argument can be summed up as follows:

* If the commons are under private, rather than collective ownership, then:
* They must have been taken by force.
* Thus authoritarianism.

In the real world , there is some room for grey though.
"
So are you are saying that those hundreds of down votes are just a drop in the ocean and it actually translates to millions of users?
Bitcoin did become a worldwide phenomenon in 2013 at the latest.
Eh? I was hoping for rational discussion. Seems that's not an option. Have a great day!
"I don't understand, are things I am saying here hard to comprehend?

I'm talking about the entire userbase. I used crypto for years before ever appearing on reddit"
not to the extent of the last run up to 20k. when i was using btc in 2013, most people didn't know what it was. 
"Well I'm sure your up vote on that thread would have made the world of difference.

Let's start again. Essentially in whatever forum, there were 2 main binary arguments

1. Bitcoin needs a cap on the number of transaction per second to develop a fee market/stop it becoming centralised.

2. Bitcoin can have no limit on the number of transactions per second because transaction growth is linear and Moore's Law will stop it  becoming centralised.

The other argument was:

1. Bitcoin should never hard fork without extreme consensus as that would result in a messy chain split where nodes that did not update would be ejected from the network

2. Bitcoin should always be updated by hard forks as it allows the market to decide.

Now I ask, how do you define Bitcoin?

Edit: sorry, not again. I realised I haven't asked you this yet, but I'm curious in your answer nonetheless. Other autocorrect corrections"
"> not to the extent of the last run up to 20k

Did anybody [except] you say that? Pokemon was a world wide phenomenon in 1999 and most people still didn't know what it was, right?"
Alright man, I am terribly sorry to have spoken wrongly in your presence. I hope to not offend again. Long live BCH!!
Explain yourself, please.
I've got to be honest - I'm not sure where the failure to comprehend what /u/flowtrop is saying is. BTC rose to universal recognition in the last few months. I doubt I have a non-techy friend or family member now who hasn't heard about it - I hear random conversations on the street about it. Early 2017 and before, this most definitely wasn't the case. So... when Roger says that BCH follows the formula that made BTC a world wide phenomenon, it can be argued (whether you agree with this or not) that BTC only truly became a world wide phenomenon since its split from BCH.
"> universal recognition

Now [you're] talking about ubiquity and not necessarily a world wide phenomenon. I don't how long you've been around bitcoin, but almost every major newspaper and major TV news network covered bitcoin quite extensively and the buzz on the internet surrounding it was massive in late-2013 already. Archives and internet traffic statistics show it got more attention than almost anything else in the world around November/December of that year."
"I's first interested in BTC around 2011, but then lost interest for a few years; that really shouldn't matter though, if BTC had obtained universal awareness in 2013---whether I were in the space or not---it would be familiar to me then. I know from personal experience that in late 2017 I suddenly had a lot of people coming up to me and asking me about bitcoin/crypto that hadn't shown any interest or awareness before (e.g. in 2013); I only remember discussing btc with friends who had computing backgrounds, like myself, then (in fact, Google trends shows only 12% of the interest bitcoin had last December, in 2013). It may have made a few headlines, but there still wasn't the *universal* awareness then as there is now. This, of course, is an opinion since we're not talking about something quantatitve, so I don't have much desire to debate it as I'm sure if you disagree we'd just go round in circles. I hope you can see, however, that even if this isn't your belief there are plenty of people who do consider 2017 as being a highly significant to the public awareness of BTC, and could consider it the real point of universal recognition. When we're in our own bubbles, be it crypto or anything else, it's often hard to judge the overall public awareness of things as we're especially tuned into anything going on that aligns with our interests. That's also not to say that 2013 wasn't a highly significant year for bitcoin awareness - it was."
"It never sat well with me that it is possible to buy up all the land.

The needs of animals who may have been using that land are often ignored. It is also not fair to people born after the land-rush is over.

Your argument may hold a grain of validity were it not for the fact that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

"Are you aware of what an organic community is? An organic community is a community that grows without outside forces such as advertising. They don't need to spread the word, place ads, because the community grows ""organically"".

We can also tell you to fuck off and downvote garbage comments. Free thinking goes both ways.
Actually I looked through his post history and couldn't find anything recent where he supports btc, found a few where he supports bch.  If anything I think his story of supporting btc before may be fake.  I'm assuming he supports bch because he can buy more full coins in hopes of them mooning rather than the few or portion of one he can afford of btc.

Glad you're not a brainless core automaton anymore but the best strategy here is to hold both coins. I hold BCH:BTC at a 3:1 ratio since I prefer BCH and it's cheaper but the better product doesn't always win so I'm fully prepared in case the market goes with BTC due to its larger network effect and subversive propoganda. 
yes. they also bought bitcoindotcom domain and bitcoin twitter handle/account. trying to confuse newcomers that bch is bitcoin. bitcoin being leaderless, doesn't care. Meanwhile, ppl like OP get brainwashed.
WELCOME HOME!!! 
You just can’t think for your self 🤣🤣🤣
"I feel you, what rang the bell for me was charlie lee's scammy twitter account.

All the rest started to fall like dominoes.

But keep your skepticism up, anything you think is not going well in BCH you should just vent out and don't complain about the down votes, it is part of the game."

Welcome friend... as far as I'm concerned it doesn't matter whether you hold BTC or BCH... or whatever. Just express yourself, use your judgment and aim for good things... if we do that in time we'll all be stronger.
changenow.io get a wallet from bitcoin.com first. :)
"I would be most happiest if both sides succeeded, I don’t see why that can’t happen. Bitcoin for the big stuff / international trade, Bitcoin cash for day to day stuff. 

Can’t we just all get along?"
"Welcome to BCH! 
Get on twitter if not already. Theres wars with shitposters vs intellect everywhere.. You have made it just in time as there will be some huge things coming from BCH that no one thought could exist. It will make other altcoins and bitcoin core obsolete. Follow @profaustus @justicemate and @sashandiggers then follow their friends. ;)"
Bcash is a scam.
"Making investment decisions based on what subreddits you're banned from... ok...

why there are cultist/change of faith posts like this on thks sub literally every fucking day? bch supporters have mentality close to flat-earthers it seems like

It's obvious which subreddit/coin supports free speech and which one doesn't.  The culture around the subreddit is indicative of the coin itself.

"I had this moment maybe a week after the fork, even if I was away on vacation before/during/shortly after the fork. Basically when the fork didn't instantly die out, I had the ""holy shit bitcoin isn't dead after all"" moment.

Granted I've been around crypto since late 2012, so I was able to see the Blockstream fuckery evolve slowly into it's current disgusting abberation. 2015-2017 was extremely depressing in terms of what Bitcoin brought to the crypto ecosystem. Extremely excited about 2018."
You're welcome.
"Unlike on the other sub, you are free to criticize or support both BTC and BCH - as long as you keep it civil, you won't be banned.

I really despise r/bitcoin for trying to censor out truth and pushing their propaganda. But BTC market share speaks for itself - from 95% to 45% in two years - they're strangling their own currency"
"right about semptember when I claimed my BCH and sent it for $0.001. bitcoin fees were right about what they are now if I remember correctly, which is still like 100x BCH fees. that when you go ""oh yeah, I remember when we used to do this with bitcoin before the blocks got full.

What kind of shit?
"The belief that the blocksize cannot really be safely raised is the whole reason BTC went the way it did. To understand BCH's *raison d'etre* really requires understanding where BTC's thought leaders went wrong and why. What did they misunderstand that led them to the conclusion that scaling onchain won't work like Satoshi thought it would? 

There's a very specific answer: they misread the beginning of Section 8 of the whitepaper where it mentions the network being ""overpowered by an attacker"" to mean a majority-hashpower attacker (51% attack) when it actually refers to a minority-hashpower rogue miner who happens to find a few blocks in a row by luck. If you read the section carefully and in context with the rest of the paper it becomes obvious, but key Core developers continue to deny this.

Why does this seemingly obscure point matter? Because that simple misunderstanding results in them misinterpreting the rest of Satoshi's explanation about SPV wallet security. It makes them conclude SPV wallets are not secure given current technology (lack of the necessary type of fraud proofs). As a result, they think of the nodes that constitute the Bitcoin network as being anyone who runs the software, rather than basically only miners as Satoshi had it. ""Since SPV doesn't really work, we need full clients to be runnable by everyone, so we must keep resource usage very low otherwise Bitcoin will collapse,"" they say. 

Once you understand that SPV already works equally as well as a full client (*unless* you want to accept 0-confirmation transactions), and that non-mining full clients actually do nothing for security and decentralization, you can see that BTC has crippled itself in several major ways for no reason at all, and that every other blockchain-based altcoin has done the same, following Core's example. 


I don't expect this to make sense right away, both since I haven't made the full argument and since it's a totally different paradigm to what is repeated as a mantra throughout the crypto space (""blockchains don't scale""), but if you stick around and ask questions, preferably also read the whitepaper and think about how Bitcoin is really driven by mining incentives, I'm confident you'll gradually come to see why BCH is uniquely positioned to exert total dominance of the whole cryptocurrency world.

Your username is a troll.
Yes is that so bad? It's the reality and an opinion that must be heard. All this place has become is a confirmation bias machine/mirror for people who are very wishful on crypto doing well. Don't get me wrong I'd love for cryptocurrencies to skyrocket. I own crypto. But this is not happening. Big money does not care about the crypto currency aspect of this technology. They care about the blockchain and other technologies that have come about with crypto currency. 
Please don't feed the troll (u/Fickle_Monster), just downvote and move on, they prey on you being a decent person.

"I wish this could be true. The hate on BTC makes more anti-bch, when I really am for it. I hold both and trade both. The ""we are the real btc"" thing here has a negative overal impact in my opinion.

Can you just upvote me so I can make a post about how cryptos are dead and only thing that is doing well with adoption is blockchain technologies. I don't have enough karma to post the truth. Cryptos are never going to reach pre January's levels. Dead

"I got literally permabanned on the spot from \/r/bitcoin for ""brigading"" because I organically found a thread trying to recruit for a campaign to start an edit war about the blocksize debate on a Linux distro's wiki, and commented asking them to reconsider what they're doing, because it might not be a good idea to make us look stupid w/ this infighting in front of the outside world.

Upon modmailing asking what was going on, I was greeted by the most psychotic hallucination character assassination wall-of-text from BashCo that you could possibly imagine, followed by a smug bitchy declaration that the perma ban stands because I apparently didn't suck his dick hard enough apologizing for constructively participating. 

These guys are toxic pieces of shit on a level that is hard to even wrap your head around if you're a normal decent person, and I strongly recommend blocking, or at least using RES to ignore every single one of their posts or comments (except for the one mod who's actually a decent guy), because there is nothing good that could ever come out of interacting with any of them. A non-trivial number of them are very sophisticated scammers/spammers/online criminals that are versed in effective ways to try to get you in trouble with reddit or god forbid even DoS or hack your accounts. Reddit doesn't give a shit, because they're too busy putting out fires every time some SJW spazzes out, so you have to protect yourself."

"If you keep some of both you don't end up in such an emotional position where the other one has to die and no perspective coming from the 'enemy' camp may be entertained or learned from.

I think in the long run one will fade, and I certainly have a strong preference there, but hodling onto some of the other coin helps avoid the sad-life obsessiveness you see in cryptocurrency trolls."
"It is great to get to discuss this on an uncensored forum and here is the side of the argument you will not get on r/bitcoin:

Essentially any non-mining node actually gets in the way of the only nodes that can add your transaction to a block. More non-mining nodes actually slow the network and can be sybil attacks. The transaction propigiating network is decentralized enough that no DDoS is going to be able to take it down.

There are reasons to run full non-network nodes: exchanges, blockchain explorers, merchant payment services, large merchants, internet archivists, developers and even us hobbyists. No one is made any more secure by running their own full nodes."
For the first 7 years or so, BTC was what was described in the Satoshi White Paper.  With that formula it became a world wide phenomenon.  In the last year and a half it became something completely different than what it was the first 7 years. BCH still has the same formula that made BTC a world wide phenomenon.  That is why I'm now much more bullish on BCH than BTC.  (The empirical evidence of a 7 year track record)
[deleted]
I've never understood this argument. Who cares about the 'true vision' of an anonymous person that started from other people's ideas? The question should be 'what is the more useful approach to advancing this technology'. If you believe that's BCH, fine - if you believe that's BTC, fine. If you believe they both have merit, fine (because fuck  this non-stop petty bullshit of having to either be 'team btc' or 'team bch'). Seriously, why is it so damn hard to have a technological discussion without the e-drama?
This is grossly simplified, and just not accurate. Also, your interpretation of section 8 is completely subjective, yet you state that interpretation as if it were fact, which it is not. 
"Wow... what a dick.

I didn't see this RUDE reply you posted to Roger before I sent you the BCH tip, elsewhere on this page: IF I'd seen this first, I'd have never given you anything, dude.

Fuck off, yourself.  Roger does NOT deserve all this shit that North Coreans pile on him, not by a longshot.  You're still fucking brainwashed.

Please re-gift my BCH tip to you, to some worthy cause -- if you have any integrity at all, you'll do that and respect my request."

"> non-mining full clients actually do nothing for security and decentralization

I keep seeing this argument but do not buy it. The use of/for non-mining nodes would be to add redundancy and resiliency to the network. Mostly if a massive DDOS happens (or power outage) and drops major routes out having other nodes to connect to will keep the network up. It can allow for routing around slow parts of the network also.

So it helps increase decentralization by giving more mirrors to DL the blockchain from. Its not much but can help only if they are spread out geographically and through different ISPs."
"The moderators can be assholes all they want in discussions for all I care. Just like any other redditor.

What matters is if they start deleting and banning because they personally disagree. I don't see that they have any duty to be nicer than anyone else in a discussion though.

You can't have communism without authoritarianism. Nobody wants to voluntarily give away their stuff and hard work, so force is *always* necessary. History proves this in horrifying detail.

"I heard about BitcoinABC a few days before the ""Segwit2x activation drop-dead drama"" and almost immediately said to myself - ""this is it""! 

I watched deadalnix's presentation in Arnhem 2017 and just erupted with happiness! Here was a guy who said ""the people who say something isn't possible need to get out of the way of the people who are doing it"", and ""imagine if google said 'enough searches have been done today, come back tomorrow' "". 

I could see that the ABC devs were solid, the vision was just right, and the timing was perfect! In short, all of my frustration arguing against Segwit, 1MB 4eva, and Lightning was released."
