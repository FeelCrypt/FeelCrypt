"No one is bloating the blockchain. It's about continuing what was proven to work for Bitcoin's first 7 years. It is about continuing the way its creator and earliest adopters intended.

Segwit makes it less efficient. You're at up to 4MB weight blocks with only 1.8MB worth of transaction capacity if 100% of transactions are SW.

They've broken the plan we bought into years before their shitty ideas were conceived and forced upon us via censorship and gaslighting latecomers."

"I have posted about a lot of things even shitty alts... I have not been banned. 

But I guess that there are two camps one wants to exhaust every option before bloating the blockchain. 

The other thinks that nodes and PoW doesn't matter.
