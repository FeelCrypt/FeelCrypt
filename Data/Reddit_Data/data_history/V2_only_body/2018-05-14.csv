hmmm.....maybe banks ARE useful!(in asset distribution and access)...
Devil‚Äôs advocate, or maybe just a question. I believe in crypto and just invested. I paid 5 fees as i was capped to a daily limit to purchase, then paid fees to move them.  Then my understanding is I paid fees to buy other altcoins (I know this isn‚Äôt specific to btc so my apologies).  Will this ever be more inexpensive long-term when it‚Äôs better adopted? I know buying actual goods and services is free, but getting btc or other crypto was a challenge and financial drain due to fees 
"Check out bitcoin.org and the bitcoin cash websites; they list software implementations of their networks, with Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC respectfully."
"The real issue is ""What is bitcoin"". If you believe the core team and the 3 people with commit access who are allowed to choose what code is implemented or not is the one and only bitcoin then r/bitcoin is the place for you! If you accept that there are multiple version of bitcoin and they all have different goals and discussion should be free and open then r/btc (despite its unfortunate ticker name connection) is the place for you. It was clear to me something was rotten the moment I saw that any talk of proposals not approved by the core team was banned. You can tinfoil hat about the motivations. But to me it doesn't really matter. You can not have UN-censorable money if you can not have open discussion about it. I don't know about you, but I did not come here to get rich quick. I came here to help change the world. "
"> But, how can BTC not be the crypto currency Satoshi wanted it to be, if he/they designed it? That‚Äôs like a contractor designing a house, building it, and people saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not the house he wanted, though. Not really.‚Äù

Satoshi's house design was a crypto-Currency for the people of the world.  The BTC core developers were replaced/corrupted and they radically changed the design of the ""house"" to only have one doggie-door entrance and a promise to provide a teleportation port next door for getting into the house in the future. The tele port would be owned by a business that would charge tele-fees if it ever got built. They admit they don't want everyone to be able to enter the house through a door because they want their corporate owners to profit from selling teleportation services.

"
And may end up with r/bitcoin being a forum about Bitcoin Cash. I think things are confusing enough with r/btc, bitcoin.com, and @bitcoin being a Bitcoin Cash forum/website/twitter handle. I used to support r/btc in its more liberal moderation, but the more I see what's happening, the more r/bitcoin's strict moderation makes sense. The two networks are now totally different, with distinct future directions, deservent of their own forums.
"I got an email about ZEC but nothing about BCH.

https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange/

Is the only announcement today that I see."
Huge
"Sorry, I was upset but the truth is, Gemini made no announcement about ""adding"" Bitcoin Cash BUT, they did announce when and exactly how they will support zcash. 

I am mostly in BCH, so don't get me wrong, I want this, but they may be putting it off due to the fork or politics. Here, Forbes got confirmation that Gemin applied for and received ability to trade zcahs, BCH..., but again, Gemini themselves have only announced zcash, it is a big difference and the title is disingenuous at the very least. "
Jokes. It was just funny timing the day before the upgrade :)
Because it does help the network.

He never moved 99.9% of his coins and even those were before 2011.
Bitcoin does not have a built in developer reward.  Anybody could have start mining from day 1 but it was a completely new thing so only Satoshi and a few others were mining in the beginning.  it was completely fair open competitive opportunity. zcash developer reward is a straight mandatory money grab
"> ZenCash and Bitcoin Private are just altcoin fork scams 

the fuck? I can see people being salty about BTCP but how is Zen a scam?  comparing zcash and zencash side by side, zcash looks like the scam to me with its founders reward"
"> The founders reward is temporary and lasts 4 years from genesis, after which miners get 100%.

They still get a substantial amount of coins. Bitcoin is perhaps the most fairly distributed crypto.

Zcoin also has a substantial founder reward. Looks like it's one of the best options around, with maybe only Monero being more private due to forced mixing."
"No smart ones keep them at home.

Oh, I see, this is really about your aversion to BCH. Wait. The price back then was $620. So far so good! "
"People are more educated today \- therefore when the opposition acts with immaturity i.e. Core Dev team, thats a tell tail sign \- people today can see the similarity's with how these 'types' behave and bad political agenda's, therefore leaving only one conclusion BTC Core dev team are highly politically motivated to 'actually' damage 'Bitcoin' success by pretending to act in 'best interests' when behind the scenes they are paid for by banking empire \- to either slowly break its confidence or take it over entirely.

\(Why am I seeing someone like Tone Vays on the Core Dev team, he is the 'last' person that should be on the team \- why? because his past as vp at JP Morgan bank shows the bias & agenda!\).

What do you do if you hate something \- want to destroy it \- but can't do anything about it?

You employ 'pretenders' \(company formation\) to act in the 'best interests' \- whilst spreading lies and instilling fear/uncertainty \- to actually destroy it from within.

Paying employee's \- controlled by a 'employer' aka Block Stream is not only against the principles of Open Source & community software, but shows a bias of control \- because... ""You have to do what you're employer says \(Coding centralisation & bloating\) \- right?"""

collecting fees on the trade related to BCH. Bittrex for example offered that on day 1 and had huge volume since. 
Can't blame them, it was a big gamble.
New York State‚Äôs Department of Financial Services approval of Gemini offering custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash is good news.
Yeah, I‚Äôm mainly calling out the fact that they do not support BCH like the headline states. Will receive does not mean has received.
"""In addition to being approved to custody and trade Zcash¬†the NYDFS has confirmed to Forbes that Gemini¬†will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash, with a total market value of $25 billion and Litecoin, valued at $8.2 billion, though details about when these currencies might go live remain sparse.""

Nothing concrete yet, but saying ""nothing about BCH"" sounds deceiving."
so your saying they could have sold the BCH in Dec  that they were holding for folks from the fork. then rebought them, making some mullah in the process? 
"100&#37; of my 50 or so transactions in 2018 have been on chain and at 1 satoshi per byte"

"> but I dont think its scalable for billions of people.

do you have any research which corroborates this? "
"Whats your home address? I hope not a soul knows you have Bitcoin, or you are ready to be robbed.

Also, I lol'd at your old post:

XD How miserable has the last 2 years been as your shitcoins keep dying in favor of Bitcoin?"
">You actually think keeping your own money is a standard to be setting?

Unfortunately, that might be what it takes to reform the fiat system. As a temporary inconvenience in time, it's worth it. "
"After years of people having their homes broken into, wallets stolen. You actually think keeping your own money is a standard to be setting?

Also, diversify your storage locations. I only keep 0.5BTC in coinbase for my petty payments and DCA.

I keep my big BTC somewhere else. "
After multiple exchanges have been hacked in the past, you actually think leaving coins on coinbase is the standard we should be setting? 
"Sorry about your economics understanding.

The free market is beautiful and finds solutions to everything. You will understand this soon enough."
as long as it's 1s and 0s on coinbase you might as well be trading pebbles or LTC

Have you used technology to exchange value before?

Unreal. Just unreal.

So you havent done onchain transactions?

I'd panic sell if you caught yourself lying to yourself. "
I have a bitpay card that I send bch to to spend from. It auto converts to USD so I usually convert before purchase. EDIT: Realized you meant cripplecoin ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
people. places. things.
On chain Bitcoin Cash? 2018 is all about adoption. If you can't name one merchant selling on chain you haven't even googled it. 
"Ive used Bitcoin on over 50 transactions. 

Should I stop?"
Who accepts onchain bitcoin? Where are you spending?
Disregard my response, I was misreading and I don't think my answer made any sense.
"Sure, as said I wasn't trying to speak to the fairness of their distribution method, I don't use Zcash for anything or hold any for the same reasons (Peter Todd was also part of the trusted seed process, I refuse to touch anything that guy is involved in on any level).

Bitcoin's distribution is definitely favorable to me over a forced developer fund as deployed by Zcash."
Yeah, well you‚Äôre wrong. Sorry.
have you even started if all you do is shuffle BTC between coinbase wallets?
It says in the article they haven't even set a date for when it will be added.  Same for litecoin.  This forbes article just has a date for Zcash
"Eh, I would say that less than 5% of my transactions in the last 3 years have been on-chain.

Onchain is easy to use, but I dont think its scalable for billions of people.

Heck coinbase payments work so easily, I actually sold most of my currency alt coins. 
"
Yeah, [5%](https://eklitzke.org/how-many-bitcoins-did-satoshi-nakamoto-mine) is clearly much better
Another thing for North 'Core'a to boycott.  That list is growing by the hour.
Should we expect a futures contract at CBOE then?  if so, when?
As a result, the cryptocurrency offers privacy to those in oppressed nations, criminals and privacy-focused individuals, drawing the attention of both supporters and detractors.

ONLY ZCASH, NOTHING ABOUT BCH. 
Speaking of Zcash, how can a coin with 20% founder reward be taken seriously when there are alternatives?
all r/BTC contains is misleading titles, fake news, and propaganda. This is nothing new.
"This world be a pretty huge mistake for Forbes and one of its staff:

*In addition to being approved to custody and trade Zcash¬†the NYDFS has confirmed to Forbes that Gemini¬†will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash, with a total market value of $25 billion*"
Don't bother clicking.  This is everything you need to know.  Misleading title linking to an ad-walled site and talking about zcash.  
Some people have to feel safe first before they make a move
how? sorry dont understand.  
BCH adoption going forward surely and steadily. 
Probably an effort to raise awareness of ZKP utility. I'd like to see new ZKP transaction types in Bitcoin (BCH).
"Anyone with their eyes open can see trouble on the horizon for BTC after it simply showed the whole world how broken it is, and how that problem was in no way actually addressed in the past 6 months other than ""Lightning is coming!"" which is simply unacceptable. Bitcoin Cash corrected the problem immediately, and is even correcting it even more tomorrow.  Supporting BCH is at minimum an insurance policy."
This is totally **huge**, those guys are pretty smart and they never ever backed BCH.  Either they flip and understand the deep problem BTC is, or the customers pressured them to support BCH. In both cases we win!
"""...details about when... remain sparse."""
Wow, this looks to be huge for encouraging the value-flippening since these guys showing any respect for BCH is like a minor Mutiny on the HMS-Bitcoin Core... 
‚ÄúIn addition to being approved to custody and trade Zcash the NYDFS has confirmed to Forbes that Gemini will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash, with a total market value of $25 billion and Litecoin, valued at $8.2 billion, though details about when these currencies might go live remain sparse.‚Äù
Probably a React website. They're the absolute plague.
Maybe the founder bribed them for a big chunk of coin? Maybe they bought 40% of it before they brought up the idea so they don't care? 
"The founders reward is temporary and lasts 4 years from genesis, after which miners get 100%. Not to say anything about the fairness of this scheme, but it should be noted it doesn't last forever. Zclassic was created as Zcash without the subsidy, though I think this as well as ZenCash and Bitcoin Private are just altcoin fork scams by Rhett Creighton basically.

I always saw Zcash as more of a research project more than a currency you'd really use though . Due to its design and the way zk-snarks was implemented among other concerns it has some fairly serious issues that are not easily remedied to be truly sound money.

You might want to look at Zcoin for the other side of Zcash. The ZeroCash and ZeroCoin whitepapers were co-written by several of the same people."
"> Speaking of Zcash, how can a coin with 20% founder reward be taken seriously when there are alternatives?

And being a corporate coin...

I guess they payed to be included."
"Not too sure if they did just yet. I know they plan on it tho. 

I went over to Gemini and did not see an option for BCH anywhere. "
"Good job... 

Could have skimmed millions in fees by now if you did it in Aug, though. "
Fuck Forbes and their shitty website filled with scripts calling scripts calling scripts.
