I'm guessing the post was edited and changed to BCash after all the likes rolled in since this hadn't been mentioned earlier.
"Why is bitcoin the real bitcoin? Who gets to decide which part after a fork is the real deal and the other not?  
I believe most of the people who say ""bitcoin is bitcoin"" and ""bitcoin cash is obviously not bitcoin"" define what bitcoin is based mainly on which client the exchanges and mining pools where running when the fork happened.
Had the exchanges and mining pools favored the other side, which one would be bitcoin?  
All I'm saying is that BOTH are Bitcoin, and we can argue all day long about which one has more merit than the other, but saying that one is bitcoin and another isn't because someone else dictated it defeats the whole premise of decentralization, trustlessness and ""validating for yourself""..

He has become awakened, realized that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin Legacy only has a veneer and a facade of being Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Legacy is an imposter coin, and is only held up by propaganda, censorship, and mindless sheep, or ignorant people.  Probably the reason you even hold alts instead of Bitcoin is because of BlockStream Core's policy of high fees and unreliable transactions, the Bitcoin dominance index went from like 90% to like 35% or something crazy.  This was all because of Core's incompetence.  If we were allowed to do on-chain scaling, we would have everything focused on Bitcoin and you would probably hold Bitcoins instead of speculating on alts.

But bcash sounds nicer anyways.
You have been lucky, I made the switch when BCash was at ATH
">I was one of the people who didn’t think the troll problem was actually that bad until I started posting pro-BCH things.

On r-bitcoin that's an almost insta-ban, and for good reason. The amount of attacks from BCH towards Bitcoin have been many and extremely vicious. (If you're wondering about examples, I'll just mention Roger going on air with the harshest words towards Bitcoin. Disagreeing with the scaling approach is one thing, shitting on what made you rich is a different story altogether.)  The reaction is normal. 

BCH has a special place on r-bitcoin: Promote BCH in any sense, shape or form, and you get a ban. (It's not as strict with the the other alts.) it's only normal.

&nbsp;

>And wow, do people really come after you for it in most subs it’s terrifying.

Leave r-bitcoin aside. If everyone outside this sub is telling you BCH is questionable, doesn't that make you think? Why does EVERYONE outside of this sub think poorly of BCH? You've got two options

* One, everyone outside this sub is an idiot,

* Two, there's something to it.

If you talk to the Scientology people, everyone is out there to get them. And David Miscavige is the true hero that is carrying the torch, bringing the true light to the masses.


I understand that the ""us vs THEM"" thing is very seductive, it makes you believe you're part of something bigger. It's David vs Goliath. You're gonna win, you're better than everyone else. Unquestionably seductive. But you really need to question *yourself*, not the tech, for choosing one of the above options vs the other.

"You should reach your own conclusions, based on the merits of logic and reasoning. For me it's simple, I want my preferred crypto to be as good as Cash. So I'm doing what I can get to get retail adoption in my area. If people have other views and goals it's fine. I've been in countries where the USD is used just as much as the local currency. That's what I wish for BCH.

The price and investment qualities don't matter much to me if I can't go to a brewery and buy some beer. That's when magic internet money becomes more real money to me.

I also believe that you can't build an economy if the poor are excluded. It needs to be all inclusive. I don't see crypto as a get rich quick scheme, but as another option for people to earn money and value. It's a ponzi if the only game is to get more people in and it's a game of hot potato. It's not a ponzi if you forget about exiting and focus on digging in and staying in it forever.

I feel like all this will reflect in the price eventually, but as I said. The price of BCH doesn't matter to me, I just want to buy beer locally with it.

https://tipPLS.me my project. I want to show people how to earn an honest living with BCH, that is all. If that draws scammer accusations, I welcome them wholeheartedly because they are fools. I'm just trying to show normal people another option that hurts no one, except indirectly to those invested in the other solution. Those invested in the other side are free to use my tactics, but they won't. I've given probably 200 people in my local community their first ever crypto. And I just started. I don't know what will happen, but maybe they will demand the breweries to accept it and I have my victory.

The BCH community is an organic one, and moves in strange directions, myself included, but generally in the same direction of making it as good as Cash. I'm comfortable with my efforts of making it cash because I know others are doing the same.

https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2017/11/rick-falkvinge-bitcoin-cash-manifesto/

This is a general guideline to the community's actions.  It's why trolls don't really faze us. We're about bringing people in, not keeping people out. The ""bcash bcash bcash"" trolls are the only ones trying to keep people away. I'm having a ton of fun giving people their first bitcoin and maybe even getting a chance to educate them and learn from them. "
If you are not sure, keep both
"It's different for everyone.

For me, the breaking point was the realization I had spent hundreds of dollars in fees to move BTC last fall (when the mempool was clogged). This created a conflict because the original vision that I bought into was outlined in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. It's hard to have financial sovereignty when it's extremely costly to move your funds (this also excludes the poor from this new technology). I also didn't believe Lightning to be the answer based on my research.

For others, it's a technical decision (getting to the scaling debate). Others it's philosophical and idealogical (getting to the original vision set forth in the whitepaper). Some will hold equal amounts BTC and BCH to hedge. Some live off of Bitcoin and pay for things with it. Some of us still hope for the best with Lightning but have a large amount of skepticism. Others hate the idea. 

It's important you ask the questions that are important to you, do your own research, think for yourself, and come to your own conclusion.

"
How much do you understand about the scaling debate that took place before the fork? That really answers your question and it's hard to give you a good answer without knowing what your knowledge is or writing a whole book.

Yeah, unbanked people don't really use bitcoin. 
It already does that. But nobody really uses BCH so it's kind of a moot point so far.

Or rather, your analogy is OK, it just fails to prove your point."
Yeah. They use Mobile Money quite a bit. And cash. If they want to 'store value' they typically prefer dollar and euro notes.

"I think we have a misunderstanding: You believe that the ""fork"" is the sideroad exiting away from a main avenue, while I think a fork is just the incident of a main road splitting into two new directions. 
In my view, no one direction is the ""fork"", the fork is just the splitting incident from which two new lines emerge. 
If you don't want to discuss it any further and see my point that's fine, but it's ""end of story"" only in your mind."
But which one of them is the fork? Just one of them or are they both forks? If something that was once whole splits, aren't both of them now forks and both have the same rightfull claim for the original name?

"Both aren't Bitcoin though.

"I believe my comment above also applies to your view. There is no scam, just a community who after deep disagreements split into two. Neither one has a bigger claim on the name than the other. Like after a divorce, no one is the ""true couple"""
"Hey there’s no need to be rude. This is my opinion. I’m not shitting on either crypto here. I’m just stating a fact. Bitcoin was not released as “bitcoin core”. Bitcoin cash was not released as “bitcoin”. It’s like Superman saying he’s Batman. I mean they’re both heroes in capes and they’re both pretty cool, there’s no need for Superman to be like “yeah I’m the real Batman and the other guy is just like....Batman lite.....Or legacy Batman.” And by the way, this comparison is totally legit. Superman is way faster than Batman and can lift bigger blocks, if you catch my drift.  
Anyway, Can anyone here give me a legitimate reason other than “shut up” as to why we can’t call these crypto currencies by their given name? "
Fair enough. Thank you for the explanation. That is in fact one of the reasons that I hold alt coins.

What good things do you think Bitcoin (cash) can do that it hasn't already done?
"Errr... as he correctly states invested in does not mean control.

Plus, no one at blockstream can commit code to core, so theres that... unless you want to make it an even more shaky conspiracy."
They seem to be usable on mobile at least!
There was an ugly schism during the hardfork between Bitcoin [Core] and Bitcoin Cash last August, and a lot of trolling and drama on /Bitcoin. It’s counter-intuitive but /btc is primarily BCH supporters.

Just because I support BCH doesn’t mean I have to like that guy 
"But here's the thing: The rivalry, or deep fundamental disagreement, predates the split in the communities and the projects, it is actually the reason for the split.  
If we did not disagree, it would still be a single project, so asking the split communities to not believe that their vision is the best choice is kind of nonsensical.  
And how do you justify that ""Both aren't Bitcoin""? Let's take another open source fork example: When popcorntime forked, weren't both versions ""popcorntime""?

"It was a little rude... these things get easily heated. I'll give it a shot, let me know how I go. 

I'd start by flipping the question: what makes BTC ""the real bitcoin"" and not BCH? None of the current devs were there at the start, and many of those who jumped on board early have thrown their support behind BCH. Like BTC, BCH is a complete chain of transactions and signatures (from the fork) all the way back to the genesis block. But, unlike BCH, BTC has made it crystal clear that it is no longer committed to many of the ideas that Satoshi presented in the white paper and elaborated in the early emails and forum posts. On this, I think a nuanced picture of the events that led to the fork, and how the big blockers were shut out of development and ""blocked"" at every point possible from influencing the development of the project complicate matters.

But anyway, who awards these names? Is BTC ""the real bitcoin"" simply because it has the ticker? Because it has greater market value? Because the GitHub is the same? And, what would you say if the market cap was reversed? Or if all the current devs of Bitcoin BTC were replaced by a new bunch who took the project in a completely different direction, whilst the old ones, seeking to preserve the current vision, forked their own chain to preserve it? Which would you call Bitcoin then? 

In the end, I do think it is all a bit arbitrary. As long as we get secure, deflationary, peer-to-peer electronic cash, I'm happy. I just think that BCH has a much better chance of achieving it, and it's interesting that they're doing it by sticking pretty closely to what Satoshi suggested."
"Yeah, exactly, I've come to the conclusion that there's a handful of people or groups that just want to decelerate Bitcoin cash for as long as they can, it's clearly a political-battle for them, obviously it threatens some or other power-structure. They probably **hate** that Bitcoin cash is so inclusive almost like it doesn't give a shit about race or nationality. http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/080/438/bee.jpg

We're forced to prove ourselves here. On the other sub if you just cheer lead you get upvotes. There is a certain level of that on this sub too but here we are also constantly being attacked and we have to defend our views.

Also, the fact is that anyone who had a good technical grasp of things but didn't push the core narrative has been banned from /r/bitcoin. So naturally you get less thorough and technical discussion over there because the only people left are the cheerleaders."
"Welcome to the light side and the rebellion ;-)"
Glad to meet you.  I'm the crazy one.  If you have any ideas about how to improve things the community is all ears.
"OK here's some BCH tip for you... IF this story is true and IF you promise not to call it BCASH anymore LOL

Another example of why it’s so important to engage people - even trolls - in a technical and polite discussion about these matters as much as possible. No name calling (“core shill”, “troll”, etc). That does nothing but reinforce people’s already made up opinions about us. 
Welcome friend! Unity is stronger than censorship, use case is stronger than fantasy, cheers on lifting the veil
"> This philosophy is why BCash will win. 

It's called ""Bitcoin Cash"", not Bcash.

The slur ""Bcash"" is used by the [rBitcoin cult](https://i.redd.it/n3bb9zgywmk01.jpg) which uses [censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7x5rgp/flashback_i_just_unsubscribed_rbitcoin_and/), [personal attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83glyd/rbitcoin_crybaby_cult_explodes_with_salty_tears/), and [spam bots](https://i.redd.it/ysx8w88gowe01.jpg).

Nothing to do with your crypto decision, but making one based off of a subreddit is probably a bad idea.
Welcome to the group that promotes free thinking.   As you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caUDXLqpdYc&),  the effects of the censorship on you were very real.
"OP
I owe you a grateful thank you. Personally I am more of a lurker gathering all the info I can. I also, like you first purchased after the fork, although I had been researching heavily since late 16.
I am very very close to moving all of my BTC into BCH. 
I won't give my personal reasons, but I can say I have a great deal of confidence in the BCH project. 
Again, thank you.

"You seem way too emotional to make a good trader. You were easy to manipulate at first, and then you dumped all your BTC as an emotional response to being banned (even Roger Ver still keeps a little BTC).

Not hating or anything, just a recommendation - buy a hardware wallet (Universa hodl, ledger, etc) and never trade, just hold."

Welcome home
I've never once been able to post something to that reddit. this karma system sucks and I'm a HARDCORE crypto enthusiast. This social media world for crypto is totally fubar!! 
Welcome back :)
Welcome. If you find that your side mostly opposes open source principles in what could be the greatest open source invention ever then it should be a strong indication that you're probably on the wrong side.
Most of us had that “holy shit Bitcoin Cash is actually the real deal 😯😯” moment at some point in time
"Hope you learned the lesson: take everything with a healthy dose of scepticism.

Question all, even this sub. "
The lack of ethics and morality in the other side's behavior was the single greatest catalyst for making me question their message and viewpoint on scaling.  It's a red flag that's an indication of something deeper going on, and should never be ignored.
Welcome 
I am confused by the meaning of this post. I concede that I do not own BTC or BCH and rarely hang out on these subs. I am an alt coin holder though. Is OP trying to explain that trolling is the problem or that BTC is worse than BCH for some reason? I am genuinely curious and would like to know the context of this post.
I hope you've learned now to always keep your eyes peeled for manipulation of discourse
u/cryptochecker
it is bitcoin cash, not bcash.
Welcome to the resistance!
I still rely on BTC’s success because I’m mining it on hashflare. The people on the bitcoin sub are assholes for sure but that doesn’t make me want bitcoin to fail. I’ve also been starting to really like bitcoin cash but I’m a realist and it bothers me that people call it the “real bitcoin”. Bitcoin is the real bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is a hard fork from bitcoin and while yes it does seem to work better in principle than bitcoin, it should still be distinguished as what it is (bitcoin cash) instead of trying to confuse the masses by calling it something else.

You really think BCH will win? BCH is not Bitcoin, as much as influential people like Roger Ver assert that it is. You think out of all the various cryptocurrencies, that BCH will somehow rise to the top over all the others, including Bitcoin? Why? So far, nothing in the marketplace has shown any evidence of that, other than a few pumps. At what point do you think BCH is going to breakout and displace Bitcoin? Why even try and call BCH Bitcoin? What will you say in a year or two when the ratio of value is even more uneven than it already is? At what point do you call it quits? Also, why do you think /r/Bitcoin represents BTC when /r/BTC represents BCH? It’s all pretty confusing. 
Hi OP.  Might be interested in checking us out at r/BitcoinDiscussion.  Many of us are still pro-BTC, but we welcome anyone with different viewpoints to participate.
We forgive you!!
Welcome, enjoy your stay! :) 
We welcome all people. Because Bitcoin Cash is for Everyone. 
One of us! One of us!
Just crow, not shit.
"Do you know how incredibly the burden is for us to take time out of our lives to respond to everybody, knowing that it's possible we are talking to a troll or a alt account and just wasting our time?  On gathering.tweakers.net I have done my best in engaging in the scaling debate and explain it to people but the mods there already made up my mind. I am a bcash shill paid by Roger Ver. How on earth can I defend myself against that? They see everything I type through that lense and they don't even spend any time at reddit at all, or at bitcointalk forum. Or at bitcoin.org. This is how incredibly effective the assassination of Roger his character has been. At the best you get a response: Yeah bcash is good technology but I can't use somebody that was created by this Roger psychopath.

"Welcome home friend, this is why we shouldn't ban trolls.  We need to encourage trolls as much as possible.  That is how we wake people up.  Not only that, but imagine the number of lurkers reading who saw the same discussions as OP and were awakened or swayed.  Even if you get in a troll fight with someone, often times they will go away rethinking things, even if they don't admit it up front because of ego or whatever.

 At the end of the day its like two breeding grounds.  Here in Bitcoin Cash Land we have the people who were able to see and envision things, people who are able to admit when they are wrong or mislead, people who are capable of critical thinking, people willing to go against the crowd even in the face of political attacks, and character assassination.  Bitcoin Cash is breeding a strong community of Liberty minded capitalists, intent on bringing economic freedom world wide.  Then on the Core side you have a bunch of brainwashed, domesticated sheep, who bow to censorship and propaganda, bow down to political pressure, and peer pressure, bow down to authoritarianism and blockstream, only know how to parrot narratives and attack Roger Ver and Jihan. 

Sometimes people forget community is an important part of a blockchain, and the BCH community is much much stronger than Bitcoin Legacy.  Bodes well for the future of Bitcoin Cash and Satoshi's vision.  /u/chaintip"
Here's a $1 shit. Bon appetit! u/chaintip
As a moderator of r/btc, I would like to thank you for the kind words. We get attacked and abused on a daily basis for doing what we do here, and it feels good knowing that our efforts help to foster a place of open discussion and dialogue in bitcoin.
"Cool story.....except for the fact that you are just blatantly lying :)

According to your post history, you have always been pro-BCH and anti-BTC.  Nice try though....it was a valiant attempt!!"
Welcome home. :-)
Continue questioning 
BCash is a name given by purpose to discredit BCH, so maybe not the best name to promote...
This is why i sold my ltc. Charlie is cancer
I don't care what you believe I care if you can learn and you have proved that.
Another enlightened person, lol, welcome to the light.

I like how all this misinformation acts like some kind of filter. You passed the test. Glad to have you :)
Seriously, this guy looks like a cartoon character, certainly very rich and powerful, but very sad looking at the mirror. God surely is in control.
