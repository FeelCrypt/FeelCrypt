Oh my God that Monty Python skit.
Wow, brainwashing concentrated into 1 slide.
"this has to be satire.

edit: yes it is."
That is not what I mean. If I want to spend my money on dumb shit, I do not need anyone's permission.
I just watched the full talk.  A few people whose opinions I value told me that he has some deeper meaning.  But I didn't find it.  As far as I can tell, he's completely serious with that slide. 
"It's ironic how it's at 'honeybadger' conference, considering BCH is the honey badger. Also, am I the only one when seeing this thread I scrolled down looking for the source thinking *this has got to be parody*? Lmao.

Edit: Lol he even calls it bcash."
"These are people trying to downplay the amount of bullshit he said while still conveniently supporting him.

He is no different to any other fanatic.

Maybe do not respect those people anymore, there is a limit of acceptable ""fence sitting""."
"Sounds like he's joking; but that guy is definitely in Poe's Law territory..."
I was just joking. 
No man, I was just joking. You really think he has 18 kids? 
What's really insane is the amount of people that listens to that twat.
You know what, fair enough. I only looked at that picture and concluded it was an obvious joke. So I will allow for the possibility that I am in fact the retard and that it wasn't in jest.  (I still think it clearly was, but I'm open to the slight chance that it wasn't.)
How the change was implemented is irrelevant. They fundamentally changed the way signatures are stored for 40% of all clients, and the aim is to make that 100% of all clients. Just because it was soft fork activated doesn't mean it didn't happen. 
">I cannot even comprehend why anyone could come to a logical conclusion that spending money is wrong.

&#x200B;

Lol wtf. Are you even trying to think of ways people try and convince you to spend your hard earned resources on dumb shit? "
Protocol change. Soft fork. Please explain.
It's gonna be an electronic beanie baby
"Is this actually real?  It feels like The Onion of Crypto.
"
If everything which is not bitcoin is a scam so the bitcoin maximalist is a scam
"is it a joke?

Bitcoin functionality is restricted, that's why many new coins appear.

If not to spend then why should we just hold it? 

&#x200B;"
Don't spend it??  
I'm curious of the sentiment of r/cryptoccurency towards this.
Good bot :)
This. I have a friend who would go further and say it's the same people who were running Germany a few decades back.
Isn't the whole point of cryptocurrency is to do whatever the hell each individual wants with it?
"watched his whole fucking talk (wasn't easy).. he's actually serious. what a tool..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2WXxgZ8h-0&feature=youtu.be (first talk)"
"Any useful contract requires oracles, which are not trustless, ""wisdom of the crowds"" notwithstanding. There is no purpose to trustless contracts other than as immutable ledger entries of legal transactions. Not one. BCH does this more efficiently than ETH."
"it's just a measure of thumb. you know like religion ;)"
The word raped has been sodomized to the point where it's completely meaningless.
Nope he is dead serious. Watch the talk and his previous reasoning. 
">Every attempt at pushing people to spend bitcoin is a scam

yes because god forbid people use a crypto CURRENCY for the purpose of transacting

fuckin hell cunt"
This sounds like a cult.
    > self regulation requires that it's vital to be rude and attack altcoins.
Segwit-communists
Technically anyone who blows himself up ends up decentralized
what the fuck.
"Wow! 

At 45:40 he shows an actual diagram of the mental gymnastics performed in order to arrive at ""The Four Universal Truths.""

Mind blown."
Right. SegWit is a scam. Noted. 
Haha, good one. 
He is not an early adopter.
Look in the history books about the eutopia that was the American West /s
Is this real?  Please give context 
Didn't they already put all of this on [bcore.org](https://bcore.org)?
I guess vitalik is drawn to that reward
"If the slide is serious then it's nuts.

If it's satire that implies the speaker is advancing the contrary view. Which would also be amazing.

In reality the slide is serious, but the speaker is using hyperbole."
