I deleted my facebook 3 years ago. This kind of mindset wont work you got to roll with the punches in life.. not resist in delusion  facebook WILL onboard 3 billion+ users to their new digital money soon enough so quickly it will feel like over night.
With all of their security and privacy issues you seriously think anyone is going to trust them with any type of monetary representation, crypto or otherwise?  If that wasn't so stupid, it would be funny.
I thought I was in r/Bitcoin for a second.
And Mr. Bean memes could be applied to any situation in our lives.
Just think of all the btrash you could have bought if you would have been a true hodler.
Teach me, Shifu🙏
"> by bankers who want to kill Bitcoin and the developers they hired to trash it.

how tight is your tinfoil hat, on a scale of 1 to 10?"
yeah not organic at all
"> I remember when the price spiked to a dollar, and I thought it was crazy that people were paying a whole dollar for a bitcoin.

Why did you think that was crazy? Didn't you think that Bitcoin would eventually become the next global reserve currency which would require a much higher market cap than just 21 million USD? What do you currently think the market caps will become for BTC and BCH in the long term future?"
Wow.. do u want to be my Friend?

"I have a trading bot that works (have the history to back it up). Would you rather use the bot or me teach you? It's not ready to roll out to the public right now (currently in the friends and family phase), just gauging interest. The elevator pitch is it trades via api so funds stay in your account. Makes about 1% a day but it doesn't use your whole balance everyday.

"I'm not loyal to shit.  BTC is more resistant to attack.  BCH you take out bitmain it's bye-bye.  Take out a few pools after the blocksize. Gets big enough bye bye.  It's not like you'll be able to run a pool out of your home with gigabyte blocks much less TOR.  A VPN might do you for a spell but it's not a long term solution nor is it inherent to the design. You guys put too much trust in government.

I'd like to see bigger blocks in.bitcoin but not to the extent you guys are talking about and it's not necessary right now."
Seems interesting, how did you set up the bot? I’m interested in learning more.
BSV? Lol.
Don't uses someone's day trading program unless you can read the code yourself and understand it. Otherwise you're just asking to have your crypto stolen. All it takes is one or two lines if code to have it send your crypto to someone else's wallet.
The setup is in SQL. It works by inputting API keys into a user database. It only needs trading access so there's no way to withdraw funds. Worst case would be to market buy/sell all your funds and that would cause us to lose reputation. The trading logic is to use USD to buy when the market is oversold and sell when its overbought. We went through 52 algos before finding the current one.

Oh yeah, that’s definitely good advice. I wouldn’t trust it if it’s a compiled executable already, but if there’s a github or something where I can read the code, then I’ll figure out the rest myself.
Obviously you haven't heard of https://www.cryptohopper.com/. You can grant people trade access and deny them any withdrawl privileges.
">	How is your hate any different than bcore's hate for ""bcash"".

Not todu but Fwiw:

1.	I dislike BSV because it was/is a divide & conquer attack to try and fragment P2P advocates - there wasn’t a period of organic discontent/lobbying like the blocksize debate, just a sudden rush of rhetoric turning a previously determined upgrade date into a ‘hashwar’ 
2.	if another sound money coin takes the crown as world reserve currency then im ok with that - so long as they arent compromised governance like BTC, LTC or Libras of this space."

Relax. All are welcome. It's a cute meme and not some moral imperative.
Just buy ear plugs, lol.
"I wouldn't say it's not caring about anything, it's more caring about the long game.

Traders generally want to exit sometime soon, be it next week, next month, next year.

Long term hodlers really don't care about exiting, and are quite happy to wait 5 years for the price to recover after a dip. It's a different game."
Holding an asset without caring about anything isn't that smartest thing in the world. And Mr. Bean isn't particularly smart so I suppose your meme is unintentionally very correct.
"This bullshit meme shouldn't have 200+ upvotes on this sub.

Username of OP checks out."
"Honestly I’m sick to death of this hodler sh!t. It’s not good advice and it’s not going to get anyone anywhere.

/r/bitcoin will appreciate this more, because it’s full of a$$hats."
"Really? Cos they're the ones i hear screaming and panicking the most.

Also am I the only one that hates people screaming in roller-coasters? I'd actually be willing to pay double the entry-fee to not have anyone scream."
Hodling is absolutely the smartest thing to do.  It doesn’t mean to hodl without analysis of fundamentals but to hodl without technical analysis which is mostly BS.  As long as the fundamentals remain the same don’t worry about the ups and downs.
Hahah... that is too funny!
Where's spender/user?

Just dollar cost average BCH, and all going to be fine!
Ouch
This is gold.
I also dislike BSV. But I also have issues with the way BCH is being run (The immediate focus after the block size increase should have been acceptance and adoption). So it's very difficult to see which way things may go in the future. I'm not even ruling out BTC fixing itself or even another fork of that. It's a bit of a mess and not very helpful.
So true 😂😂😂
I understand the sentiment but trading done right allows you to increase your stash. A hodler living off their crypto gains (so not working) can eventually run out of money and can be stressful on dumps. If that hodler learned to trade they could hodl and increase their stack.
"Guys I just need 1 person to use my stellar link on coinbase all I need is 10$ and you get 10$ as well which you can sell, so that I can buy exactly 6k stellar im like 30 stellar off and this 10$ would really help, if one person can just use my link thanks in advance

Trade stocks (earn div maybe ) - Hodl Cryptos (especially BTC)
upvote manipulation ^
"Me too. I looked at it and though, ""but I thought I unsubbed""."
"I love how it got 200+ upvotes. That's not manipulated at all.

""Hodl"" was perverted from its original meaning and now the tired old meme is pumped by bankers who want to kill Bitcoin and the developers they hired to trash it."
