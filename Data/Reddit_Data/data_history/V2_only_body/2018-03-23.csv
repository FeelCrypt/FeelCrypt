I've been in the main Bitcoin communities since 2013, I have seen exactly what has happened in terms of moderation.
It has meaning, you just need to think about it a little bit.
I think u just formed a coherent sentence but it has absolutely no meaning, nice job.
Maybe used an api
If the queen had balls she’d be the king
"How is this any different from running a tab at the bar instead of paying for each drink individually? 

Even better: if that coffee shop has a route to the bike shop I need to buy a tire from, I can use my existing channels to pay for it, saving me even more transactions on-chain.

Do you really need me to explain this to you? This is LN 101."
"Maybe it won't. ;)
However, the roadmap for LTC and BTC are quite parallel. They may likely share the same fate. That could be good, or bad. If that path turns out to have a bump, or brick wall, then LTC offers no diversity from BTC.

Since adoption is still very low, many seek diversity."
"Both my 1 sat/byte transactions were confirmed within 4 hours. This is longer than I'm used to, and yeah, it ain't instantaneous, but to BTC fees are not back to 300 sat/byte. People are just overpaying in fees again because of a spam attack, or are really desperate to get that next-block conf.

"
I'm not going to indulge hou any further. You are deliberately trying to misrepresent my point. DYOR
"That is just a series of unsubstantiated claims with a particular political motivation.

The Lightning Network has a series of engineering problems just like any other system."
"Bullshit. Bitcoin still is trustless, and LN doesn't change that. If you need trustless transactions, there is always the main chain to do so. If you want to buy a few cups of coffee over a period of 30 days, do you really mind sacrificing a bit of that trust between you and the retailer for mutual benefits?

No, I won't buy a house or a lambo over the LN, and no, I don't want to see your purchases of a cup of coffee cluttering the mainnet.

Mainnet for large investments that require 0 trust. LN for everyday purchases that don't require 0 trust.
"
"Bitcoin used to be trustless. This is why people say BCH is bitcoin. 

Also, for LN to be the primary scaling solution you don't tie up just a bit of money. You tie much or all of it up out of necessity otherwise you're gaining 0 efficiencies and making the same number of base layer transactions. "
Even if LN nodes become centralized, it is still a system built on the trustless base layer of bitcoin. Yeah, you tie up a bit of money, but do so between yourself and another you trust enough to do that with. Be it a vendor (the illustrious coffee shop everyone always talks about) or a friend, you apparently trust that person enough to keep some money tied between yourselves to the benefit of instant transactions and reduced fees. If you don't want to route past big nodes because you want to keep the network distributed, by all means, don't route past big nodes.
"> There being a ""debate"" was a forced narrative, and fact is actually that no discussion between two sides actually occurred.

I spent that entire year doing research into whats-what, and can tell you for a fact that it *was* a discussion. It wasn't a lets-sit-together-and-talk-things-over, coordinated discussion, but definitely a discussion. Medium posts, twitter, Slack, Discord. Lots of posts on reddit to and fro, many heated debates in the comment sections of both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc, and other subs.

The discussion rapidly polarized, with neither side wanting to give way to the other, but there most definitely was a discussion, and even though the discussion was politicized, many good informative and more importantly *factual* posts were made."
"I mean I don’t post all the time. Just when the crazy news comes out, like which senior staff member has been fired or resigned that day. It’s not my fault that happens regularly.

And I wouldn’t say I hate trump, in the greatest sense, I feel bad for him. Although he’s such a dick and has caused so much pain for others that I’m pretty indifferent to any comeuppance he receives, and tbh rather looking forward to the meltdown, as it’s highly entertaining."
How many times do you settle your tab already? Per drink or per visit? LN saves 0 base layer transactions in that example. Subscriptions and recurring transactions are the only advantageous use cases at the moment and they still require a hold on your LN bank account.
[removed]
"> People should be ashamed of posting such things with no proof.

...said the redditor that claims LN is not a scaling solution, but whom doesn't even list *why*."
So you're going to effectively have a bank account for all coffee purchases? How much coffee money are you going to tie up at one time? This won't be substantial enough to reduce base layer transactions. 
lol...my lightning node says otherwise
I'm guessing your wallet has 0.3 BTC and you're positive you'll be a millionaire in 2 years. Probably bought at 18k too.
Nope I don't hold BTC-segwitcoins, I only hold BCH the real Bitcoin.  I was also [able to predict BCH before it existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/), and soon after the fork converted all of my crypto, and have been all in on Bitcoin since the price was in single digits, because I opt out of too big to fail central bank scam systems.  I also opt out of segwit scam systems.

Theres still memes and bants so I think so
Whatever the cause, it's evidence of a broken system. Reddit has done nothing despite outcrys from the community.
Not soon enough, man.  I remember Digg imploding and Reddit has that written all over it right now.  People need an alternative that is actually functional.
On it! 
Or steem.it?
"It's got some of the mechanics of medium, but it also shares Reddit and Twitter-like architecture and Mechanics as well. It's worth trying out imo. Runs on test net at the moment.

There will be some monetary value behind voting that enables a steem-esque reward of content creators, that will allow users to directly reward each other without an intermediary (besides the dAPP). I think it does the game mechanics a little better than steem tho, and hopefully avoids the pitfalls that steem has fallen into."
Not yet, it's in early beta stages. Needs a desktop client to run right now. The more data and feedback they can get from beta the better the final result will be.

"No not worship lol, heck no. Still, he is one of a number of noteworthy developers in the space that tend to be rather discerning with how they allocate their time. As such, the fact that he is an advisor lends a small amount of legitimacy to the project. 

Also there's no native token or ico or anything. No moon lambos, just a network in beta with cool mechanics. This isn't a shill post. I literally just like the platform, and it gets my hopes up that centralized aggregators and dealers of massive amounts of user info will cease to exist, at least to the absurd extent that they do now. Imo this is the best shot so far. Steem is broken a/f, but I'm all ears if there is anything else anyone wants to send my way. I'm sure others are under development."
Ha ha! Rcash would be an insult from reddit legacy! Rch surely ... ps Johnny cash is the man! 
Bitmessage seems unnecessarily complicated imho
">Do I need to pay for every comment I make

No, when you create a post you get to decide if comments are free, or if you'd like people to pay to write comments, like if you'd like people two leave their 'two cents'-- but most people set it as free anyway - it's up to you as the content poster to choose the prices. What this does is give a lot of flexibility depending on what content you want to post, like a file, or a youtube video, writing, photography, music, whatever... You can set everything as 0 zero and just earn when people tip or upvote, but maybe you want people to buy an extended/behind-the-scenes video. etc.

"IPFS is fricking briljant. (Inter-Planetary File System)

All though long term a truly decentralised internet will need decentralised hardware. But here comes Elon Musk with his own satellite network that can be completely disconnected from the current internet.  So hopefully the citizens of the word will have a internet that is decentralised in protocol and hardware before the powers decide to take back control over the internet. 

Also long range point to point Wifi mesh networks. These could work for Bitcoin Cash even if these seperate island networks only connect every 10 minutes to the rest of the internet for downloading the latest block and uploading the new transactions. (but you can't mine from within) "

"The problem is not the code.  It's easy to set up another website.  The problem is the userbase.  Once people register on a particular site, it's a lot harder to get them to move to another site.  

Also a site's owners have to build up trust in the community- trust that the site is well-run with good administration/moderation, trust that the servers are well maintained, trust that the company behind the site respects the users and won't sell them out, etc etc.  Each time you start over that has to be rebuilt.

It's not actually, the steemit front-end looks like that, but anyone can create a different front-end, like [DTube](https://d.tube/) has done for videos, the steem blockchain is front-end agnostic, you could easily create something that looks like reddit with similar mechanics running on steem blockchain."

"Go to the steemit ""hot"" or ""trending"" pages, most of the time that's the way they are."
You know what? Steem has a market cap of $500,000,000, if you come up with something better, go for it, you'll be a millionaire in no time. But so far I'm not aware of anything more successful than Steem, so until there is, it remains the best option.
So what's your solution to that? Genetically re-engineer humans? All of the platforms are going to have this problem, reddit has this problem, the point is not to create an utopian perfect platform, just a decentralized replacement for reddit, don't let perfect be the enemy of the good enough.
<3
That's not my experience, not at DTube at least, it seems to work pretty well there ...
Use another interface then, there are several. It doesn't have to be a web interface, can use a desktop client like Vessel.

"> It's awful for organic interaction. The incentive scheme encourages pandering to circlejerks and shallow comments. It hyper encourages hive mind behavior.

You mean like ... reddit? Oh great, because that's what we want to find a decentralized alternative to, don't we? We can worry about fixing human nature later."
Steem is just a platform, you can make anything on top of it. If you want to eliminate the incentives, you could easily fork the code for Steemit.com to show and post only payout-declined posts and comments. It would be fairly trivial to do and now you have the decentralised forum you want, only using Steem as a censorship resistant forum.
I guess it will get better when there are more people, no?

"I'm not sure that would be the case... 

It requires a lot of infrastructure, but that is already in place. Its storage requirements are multiplied per post because it is distributed, but that is a design specification in a distributed network.

The real stumbling block would be large per post storage overhead, which is what I'm not sure about regarding the Ethereum blockchain."

Steem.it is a wreck, imo. It's mechanics encourage mindless voting on things likely to be voted on, and pump bots a s whale manipulation. The end result is a bunch of clickbait and swimsuit model fluff posts that look like they were made by bots.
I am just saying it's a seperate network from the internet making the internet + his system together a more decentralised system that either appart.

"Once any “decentralized” platform goes mainstream the switch gets flipped.

Unless a platform is developed and ran totally anonymously. Otherwise, the powers that be will not allow such thing as an uncontrollable decentralized free community is a threat to control.

We’re lucky to even have cryptocurrency, and you see it’s a constant battle just to hold on to what we have. Luckily bitcoin was developed and released anonymously. Now the only hope to “destroy” the protocol is to gain control from the inside...

Nevertheless, keep trying, don’t ever give up because then, the outcome is certain.

Obvious yours.org shill.  Lol. 
Since corporate ads are the new main focus of reddit, the only way to show your disagreement is by having an ad blocker for reddit. It's the only way the admins understand.
">(In fact try this: block connections to amazon's ad system on reddit and see if you can still use reddit)....

It works just fine - I use a script blocker (safescript) and blockout all ad/analytics from google and amazon, and the site works just fine."
A forum on ZeroNet would be an interesting alternative. 
I'm using uMatrix and uBlock Origin, both block the Amazon ads (and Google ads too) by default. Haven't had any issues on Reddit so far, although most sites break when subject to this level of blocking.

Ok, that website seems neat but is hella complicated sounding. Do I need to pay for every comment I make on social media? Fuccccck that. I know websites gotta website, but I'm not interested in managing my money or making a profit off social media. I just wanna watch videos occasionally, upvote and downvote to my hearts content, and write inflammatory comments occasionally.
Isn't Steemit a pretty decent decentralized platform?
"There's no other way, everything with centralized control always ends like BTC.

300 bits u/tippr"
Is it true that the Ethereum blockchain can support even social communications?
Although in general there should be more decentralization in the world, social media is not something that should be peer-to-peer. There would be no way to stop shit like spam, doxxing, death threats and worse short of a voting system controlling visibility, but a voting system like that would lead to a mob mentality that makes the circle jerks and echo chambers on reddit look tame in comparison.
even if you decentralise, do you think AI + unlimited resources will enable big bro to shape the  conversation?

In theory yes, it would still be possible to upvote directly on the blockchain but you do not need to take these upvotes into account in your front-end if you don't want to. I don't think that would be a good idea but can be done.
