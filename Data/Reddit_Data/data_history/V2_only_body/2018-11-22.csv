"I don't know that I agree. He's a HODL'er yes, but that's for BTC. He's always advocated that LTC was meant to be spent.

I think his justification of wanting to remove his bias was valid.

And maybe I'll learn something...BTW I think I know what I'm talking about and that's what matters ( to me).
Agreed. But he had every right to sell when he did. He isn't a CEO and LTC isn't a security. People who are butt hurt over it shouldn't have bought a asset at $300+ that was at $3 under a year before. They should take responsibility for their own actions.

I thought the narrative is that Bitcoin cash is the original work dating back to 2009? From a technical perspective since it is a UTXO fork it is a work in progress dating back much further due to copying all the code and giving an airdrop to all BTC users , where BTC users have to actively choose to drop support for BCH to reflect in the price , otherwise BCH price has an advantage over BTC due to a certain percentage of BTC users losing their airdrop and or not being aware of BCH creating scarcity

False, if you have an open channel with a non zero balance, you need to be online. The only time you wouldn't need to be online is if your side of the channel has 0. So yeah, if you don't have any money, you don't need to be online, but that's not really a useful thing.

So, the fact that I need something like a watchtower, which has access to my private keys, or 'pop online' every 24 hours means, by definition, it is 'less useable' than legacy Bitcoin. Cold Storage on lightning simply isn't viable. 

Since I have to do extra work, and potential pay money and trust some ""watchtower"" with my private keys = *not as useful*

Casual users are discouraged by the fact that every lightning channel requires 2 on-chain transactions (one to open, one to close). This means it isn't cost effective to use lightning unless you plan on making many transactions before you close it out.  "

Or he can just change his mind over time.  


Only reason for him to have Litecoin now would be if he for example worked at Coinbase and knew that Litecoin would be listed, which was the case in 2017.  


If conflict of interest was his primary concern he would have sold his Litecoin before it got listed on Coinbase or even when starting to working there."
"> you need to be online

The most popular wallet for Lightning is eclair for android and never needs to be online when not in use. You can leave it offline for years.

Bitcoin is peer to peer currency, and we are discussing using it as a currency, of course you won't use lightning for cold storage, thats what onchain is for.

again , only for the seller

> trust some ""watchtower"" with my private keys 

no trust needed as the watchtower doesn't have your private keys

This is false for multiple reasons. 

-- You do not need any direct onchain transaction to rebalance or reload a channel 

-- Most channels will seldom close 

"
"Well I guess that means that more and more people will be using the lightning network once they learn how easy it is. But maybe the fact that this sub is now more active than r/bitcoin means there might be disagreement? 

> -- You do not need any direct onchain transaction to rebalance or reload a channel

The only problem there is you need a centralized hub to do the replenishment, and centralized hubs are easy to censor. Again, these are all a few of the reasons some people think the lightning network is unlikely to become popular. That on-chain scaling is a better solution than the unfinished and at this point technically burdensome ln. We also haven't even touched several other problems with Lightning, the biggest being the routing problem.

But best of luck with lightning, I do hope it takes off. I just don't think it will. 

The great thing about open source software is if it does, it will possible to implement on the Bitcoin(BCH) chain as well, so I look forward to seeing how it works for Blockstream/Lightning Labs. If their work results in something that works better as sound money than anything else, the world will be a better place. "
">centralized hub to do the replenishment,

no , you can reload by accepting BTC from another channel in exchange for goods or services (remember Bitcoin is p2p cash) or use cross atomic swaps , or use a decentalized exchange to reload

>unlikely to become popular.

It already is far more popular than BCH  with more users and usage. You realize lightning already has many thousands of merchants accepting it?

>the biggest being the routing problem.

This myth has been disproven time and time again. Please do your own research as you keep stating false assumptions

>it will possible to implement on the Bitcoin(BCH) chain

It will be too late by than, and many BCH fans are indoctrinated to believe false propaganda against lightning so are less likely to adopt it. "
"> and many BCH fans are indoctrinated to believe false propaganda against lightning so are less likely to adopt it.

Most of the BCH fans I know are here because we want something that functions as sound money. I can't speak for anyone else, but if Bitcoin+Lightning starts working better as sound money, that will be great! 

The research I've done tells me lightning is unlikely to become popular, sound money anytime soon, but I would love to be proven wrong. Only the future can tell.

I only care about usefulness. The day billions of people around the world are using lightning to transact in a safe and uncensorable manner, that will be wonderful, and I will be the first to say I was wrong."
Great that you are open to new information , but I would be skeptical of your previous sources due to the high amount of misinformation you are taking in. Almost every statement you made about lightning was inaccurate which was shocking. There is still plenty of problems with lightning and much work to be done but those criticisms were not great ones. 
"Almost every statement you made about lightning was inaccurate which wasn't shocking. There are still plenty of problems with lightning and much work to be done. It's been that way for a long time. It's always about 18 months away™ from greatness.

> LN was launched in early 2018 and BCH was created in 2017.

False. Development on LN was launched way before anyone had thought BCH was a possibility. We need to compare when development began, not when it 'launched'. I remember hearing people talk about Lightning since at least 2016, probably sooner, it's just taken a LONG time, and has a LONG way to go before it's as popular and easy to use as BTC or BCH."

That's not actually relevant here, because BCH is already accepted. So it's a wash, at best. 

So 24 stores accept LN natively, and *maybe* 4k can use them on an exchange like coinbase (that already accepts on-chain BCH for almost no fees and less hassle).

> What? LN was launched in early 2018 and BCH was created in 2017.

The LN white paper was written in 2015, and Lightning Labs launched development shortly thereafter. So you need to get your facts straight. People have been working on Lightning for MUCH longer than Bitcoin Cash, with MUCH less adoption right now.

But not at his advantage. He locks in his trades months in advance and has to take the price at that moment. Same with Charlie Lee, if he announced he would sell weeks/months in advance then that would indeed create a market response, but not one he gets to benefit from.  
"> He didn't owe anything to anyone, he disclosed it because he's just a good guy trying to do the right thing.

They are also liars. It's well known that both have mined LTC on graphic cards from the start of litecoin. 
Well of course, banks routinely give away ownership stake for no money at all.  Oh, we can all see how very sensible it was for Charlie to sell all his coins and buy a seat at a German bank.  But if a few more commenters chime in maybe they can massage the narrative further.
">Charlie Lee told everyone the price was going to fall and the market would enter a long bear phase.

How would Charlie know something like this beforehand?"
"From a moral standpoint, this is not the behaviour you want to encourage in the people that develop coins, because that way you're affirming the volatile and pyramid scheme-like nature that every coin is susceptible to degenerate into, if that already isn't the whole point of the ICO in the first place. As the average crypto enthusiast, as long as your coin isn't well established as a currency, you have an interest in honest developers who have a personal stake in the coin's success.

Assuming that you're not one of those who found lambo-wealth from previous moonings, the mindset that you're displaying is similar to the one of poor people who vote fiscally conservative because they believe that one day they too are going to be among the rich. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but your line of thinking to me seems fallacious, given the circumstances.

There is also nothing smart about having insider-knowledge.  

If you're interested in learning how to take advantage of markets, there is a wealth of ways to sink your time into that. 

All that aside, what made you think that it's appropriate to applaud behaviour that is detrimental to the long-term success of  cryptocurrencies in general...on a platform largely populated by those who are interested in the long-term success of  cryptocurrencies? Kind of nasty, if I'm honest."
Executives have to announce their trades months in advance and then commit to them at whatever the new market price is. This is the only way to avoid insider trading.
You're someone who would applaud someone who steals from a handicapped person.
Please, sources. Nobody really uses BTC for anything other than speculation.
"Sorry I should have been more clear. It's about the rate of adoption. Everyday, the number of people using Bitcoin(BTC) as a form of money is *decreasing*. High fees make on-chain transaction not suitable for everyday use, especially for people who don't have a lot of money.

The fact that Bitcoin(BCH) can be used by everyone, because fees are never an issue: that's key. We think this means it's more likely the current trend, of *increasing* use cases for Bitcoin(BCH) will continue because it's the best form of sound money out there. 

There are a lot of people causing drama, but that has nothing to do with the definition of sound money, and the fact that nothing out there today meets the definition of sound money more than Bitcoin Cash. 

Lightning is unsuitable for most use cases because of the need to be always online, among other problems. It's less usable as money than legacy Bitcoin."

"Actually it's a very solid excuse. I think his metaphor with a son, placing a bet on him whether he would be accepted to a specific College is a bit convoluted, confusing and not real world. 

A better one, and real world one, is how chairmans of the FTC, SEC, federal office holders and US politicians in general, including POTUS (the current one being an exemption for some reason) either divest financial holdings or put them in a blind trust. This discourages making decisions based on personal financial interests.

Assuming this Charlie Lee could have potential influence on the price by working on the Litecoin project, then yes, if I was interested in the well fair of this currency, I would not want him holding a substantial amount of coin. I would want him to continue to receive and spend the coin for real world first hand experience. 

A few things: 

didn't know this guy until now; 

I googled ""hodl shirt Charlie Lee "", and there is a photo of him wearing a HODL shirt with L printed behind it (maybe not the best message if you think crypto in general is about to take a long slide--not sure of timing)

BCH, BTC, ETH and LTC all took around a 50% drop in value since last year this time. (He sold in December?) BCH took the hardest fall with this latest hard fork. Every graph looks almost identical. Was this guy responsible? Is that actually the narrative. 

I don't think anyone should HODL any crypto as an investment. Treat as currency not a stock. If you believe in the currency, use it. Buy stuff with it or sell stuff and accept it as payment.

"He should have said ""I'm taking LTC private at 420""."

So you're not new, just dont pay attention to what goes on in here, got it.
Anyone in Bitcoin since 2011 knew this was going to happen. What kind of drugs do people have to smoke to think that such insane prices were sustainable. I mean you only need to look at a graph. This is like the 5th time it's happened. Its not rocket science. 
Someone has to be the true story hero.... for brainless minion content I suggest r/bitcoin and r/litecoin, pretty good venues.
Where's the ad hominem in this post?
Yea, he made bank and didn't bother to hide it
no... this sub is known for being censorship free and true stories, unlike r/bitcoin or r/litecoin
Immediate ban on rlitecoin if say it..
BCH is like owning a fake Rolex and trying to convince everyone it's real as the second hand keeps jumping like a frog.

Free market. Grow up. Don't make excuses for not thinking for yourself. 
"Shitpost

Who gives a crap what another person did with their property? Completely unrelated to anything "
I've never understood why people give Charlie shit for this.
"Yes.  With all the btcsv nonsense going on, Charlie lee still remains one of the biggest scammers in the crypto space.  He does not get enough shit for this either, and Ltc proles still worship him.  I somewhat hope that this bear market kills off ltc 

Edit: spelling"
Still people worship him like they worship Trump.
Wen BCH4567 and BCHXYZ?
Probably bought them all back by now.
pure business
Lol at salty tweet
r/cryptobets 
"Why does the BCH community feel the need to play Us vs. Them with every other crypto?  This attitude is bad for the whole crypto community.

Inb4 ""We'Re ThE vIcTiMs!!!1"""
Man Bitcoin cash so butt hurt that yall are attacking coins that work better. Oh wait that's been the foundation of the coin from the start...
I knew at once that Charlie was a fraud the moment Luke-jr called his project a scam and he didn't disagree.
Charlie Lee was just smart and didn’t believe in this HODLing bullshit. He made money and a lot of idiots who held didn’t. 
Listen you idiot, he sold at a time where the volume was there and it was in his interest to do so.his selling had a negligeable effect on the LTC price and he disclosed everything. What more do you want? Now what happens when btc returned from mtgod is sold in a bearmarket? That’s more influential on price retards.
So what coins Charlie is holding?
With telling he sold he actually gave a great advice with that I think. Honest and straight forward.
Sounds like a smart move to me...
ITT: triggered LTC fanbois 
"So he is a bad man for making a pretty smart financial move?

&#x200B;

A friendly reminder that everyone's decision to hold or sell is their own."
Not married to his investments...a good lesson if you ask me. ( but nobody asked me, Ha!)
“Crypto is the future!”

"His shirt meant ""You HODL while I SODL"""
"He explained why at the Litecoin Summit

https://youtu.be/C_pTOomVtI8
>Charlie Lee's Keynote at the 2018 Litecoin Summit"
"I will defend Charlie here:

1) He gave full disclosure of what he sold, when and how much

2) At that time he also told everyone that it's in a bubble, and to expect the bubble to be followed by a pronounced bear market"
"its really a reminder to me that people want a leader. all those people came in 2017 with that centralized mindset. 

they look to the xrp founders or ltc founder, or lesser known coins with lesser known figure heads to pump their coins and make them rich. but obviously my point wont gain any traction here. "
That feeling you get when 'libertarians' all of a sudden feel the need to have opinions on other people's actions and shit on someone cause they sold a decentralized asset when they wanted to. Good job idiot.
And what does this have to do with Bitcoin Cash?
When he said hodl I think he meant nano XD
"BCH folks ragged on Charlie for pushing LTC while holding LTC. So he sold his. For all we thought at the time, he sold before the peak, and lost out.

Lucky for him.|

But looking back now and bitching about him selling when it was what BCH people wanted him to do at the time."
Charlie Lee was always the original crypto scammer.  Yet somehow the idiotic community adores him. Hilarious. 
It isn’t a scam to sell coins you’ve developed. Anymore than it’s a scam to sell cookies you’ve baked. 
"Of course.

It was all a giant pump and dump.  "
Bch is a shit show, so you have to rehash an old story that was explained a long time ago? This speaks more to the state of Bch than anything imo.
Friendly reminder that this sub is centered around shitting on other coins
hodl is only important for bitcoin. not for the fork or alts. easy.
Seems like he was the smart one in the room that day
Is that a shitpost trying to discredit this sub?? 😕
Whats with all the personal attacks in this sub. Who gives a fuck about his coins. Or him in general? Hasn’t done anything important in years.
And ?

"This obligatory comment lacks critical thinking. First of all, who cares? Second of all, how many BCH has your precious memory dealer sold at any point, with or without telling the community? Seems like BCH has more drama than any coin out there, and constant price spikes before major dumps like we literally just witnessed. BCH/ABC/SV right now is making the entire community look rather frivolous and pathetic. 

You can't get your shit together so you attack your primary/secondary competitors. This Charlie argument is irrelevant.

LTC is pretty clearly free of fork drama and approaching BTC-level security. Focus on getting your shit together if you need to be tribal about your coin of choice. We'll see where things shake out..."
"Yeah, that was a dick move and he deserves to be criticized for it, but if you think there is really such a thing as ""insider trading"" then you don't seem to grasp the first thing about cryptocurrencies."
It's almost like it's a scam? Hmmm
Charlie Is sold my Litecoin Lee
Trust no one, hedge your bets
"""It's Bitcoin, just lite."""
Lol!

now if i only didnt have to sit thru the entire vid
"> 1) He gave full disclosure of what he sold, when and how much

*After* He sold. If Zuckerberg tried that with Facebook shares he'd spent the next decade in jail."
I have to admit that he timed the market well. Which left a sour taste in the mouth of LTC holders :-)

"Libertarians SHOULD have opinions on other people. Think AirBnB - Everybody have opinion about everybody else based on reviews. That way hosts know not to let trouble maker into their apartment. No need for government for this system to work.

Similar to that we know in this space who to trust/follow and who to avoid. Charlie Lee is on top of my “avoid” list because of what he did. How anyone can buy LTC as even his creator and main figure don’t trust in it is beyond me.

"
This is r/BTC not a subreddit dedicated to only Bitcoin Cash. 
"> BCH folks ragged on Charlie for pushing LTC while holding LTC

You mean ragging on him for pushing LTC while holding LTC so it would increase in value and then sell it and make mad personal gains. And that's what he did."
We wanted him to sell? 
Adam Back and Greg Maxwell got in to LTC mining from the very first day which gave them a financial incentive to fuck up Bitcoin. 
He was very open with what he did though, and explained the reasoning behind him selling (bubble)
That's true, but BCH Bitcoin Cash will go to Zero, Zilch, Nada too. Something is fishy.
"The reason was partially due to high profile blockstream people, such as gregmax, having heavy bags of litecoin he mined on the side while he developed for bitcoin.

It is not a coincidence core all shilled ltc in conjunction concomitantly, e.g. adam back in twitter several times. The advantage of having a cesspool echo chamber is that manipulate all of your community to say ""bcash is trash, use litecoin"". That's such a help to unload one's ltc bags."

"I am glad we agree that Charlie Lee dumped all his coins then bought a seat on the board of a German bank.  We also know that he is king of the fake account trolls.

We part ways when from these events you somehow deduce something about an unrelated project."
Sold out for dear life.  
Learn the game. Hating is counterproductive, this game is here to stay. Crypto is above jurisdictions and even tracing the wealth of big players will stop being possible at some point

Give it up dude. People started working on Bitcoin Cash in 2017, long after people started working on LN.

"
Just what if you believed and got scammed, too? Bitcoin Cash is approaching Zero Value. If it pumps up, it just gets dumped harder.
Important lesson. Learn to know when to sell and use that logic. Not emotions.
"In Charlie Lee's defense, he did say that he sold it all, that the price was not sustainable and that he expected it to go down.  


So in that sense he was a great Shepard."
@satoshilite took us for a fool! Making so much money on our backs. This guy looks so hauthy, I can’t stand him..
I didn't realize this was the litecoin subreddit.
Don't tell me what to do!
ahaha really funny!))
Fool a few who are trusted in private and you will fool many that trust them. Since it was done In private the public and skeptics can't disprove it. Not really straight up if you ask me. 
except for that bit where he privately signed for Gavin, John and the BBC
