"Even with all the support in the world, it will create two coins.

BlockstreamCore already declared war on it, so it will be messy no matter what.

I think it would be best to not further split the market. Eventually SegWitCoin could maybe play the role of ""gold"", while Bitcoin cash could play the role of ""dollar"", so to speak."
"The number of nodes isn't really important, it's the economically relevant nodes that are important.

This is going to come down to exchanges payment processors and merchants IMO."
"It will be impossible to ignore the other chain. Just check out Bitcoin cash, every exchange either already has or is in the process of adding it.

So in reality the real question will be, how can we protect our SegWitCoins from SegWit2 replay attacks. In other words, if they really hard fork, which I highly doubt, we will end up with two SegWit chains. 

A few exchanges will list both (remember ETC?), because there is a lot of money to be made from those traders. In the end both coins will be on all exchanges.

And because all of this is 100% predictable, a lot of merchants/services/wallets will stay on the legacy chain and maybe optionally add support for SW2X."
"Developers don't mean shit in the face of economic consensus.

I just hope that the consensus is clear in the days leading up to ~Nov 18th.  Because if it's clear that there is no support, the miners won't even attempt the fork.  However, if everyone gets on board and universally abandons the old chain, it doesn't matter what the developers want.

I'm not making any predictions yet.  I'm simply saying that the economic majority will decide the outcome of this thing."
"> Just check out Bitcoin cash

But this is exactly my point.  Bitcoin Cash had absolutely no support besides a minority of users.

I'm talking about *if* the 2x fork has wide economic support.  

Regardless, it will be interesting to see what happens if >90% of the miners actually follow through with this.  If the economic support isn't there, then there won't even be a fork.  I'd prefer this scenario over a messy chain split.  However, if we see widespread economic support from wallets, exchanges, payment processors, and merchants, then I don't think it'll be a messy fork.  I think it'll gain economic consensus.

I think you're ignoring the scenario of the economic majority supporting this.  All I'm saying is that I don't know if it has an economic majority yet.  But if it does, the fork will be cleaner than you're making it out.  If it doesn't, then there likely won't even be a fork.

The worst case scenario is a contentious fork."
"> I don't think exchanges and miners want to end up on a useless private fork

Agreed.  This statement is true regardless of which side you support.

> while all those million users stay on the actual main chain.

The vast majority of users don't know how forks work, nor which one they're on.  They rely on their exchange/wallet to handle that for them.  That's why I said it's going to come down to what the exchanges/wallets/merchants do.

If Coinbase, Shapeshift, Gemini, and other big market movers all fork with the 2x miners, and ignore the old chain, then millions of users will automatically move to the new fork.

Consensus comes down to the economic majority.  "

"Look up some charts, it's really only lost marketshare once blocks started to get full and nothing was done about it.
