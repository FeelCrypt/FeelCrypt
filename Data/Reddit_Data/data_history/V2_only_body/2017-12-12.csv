Yeah and if they don’t like the a different version they will just have a twitter campaign calling the devs pedohpiles and saying there is no consensus and they will do everything in their power to block its release or adoption. It’ll be another S2X all over again, this is a fact and has been repeated over and over and over by this team. 
So you believe 100% on-chain is a viable scaling strategy? If no, then why would anyone use off-chain layers if on-chain fees are near zero?
Not much market demand?! Also, Ln works better with segwit...have you read anything about LN? What about the tor like security and anonymity it adds on top of crazy cheap fees? 
Show proof of this exact transaction happening or you are lying.
How is there no market demand for a LN? It's obvious to me there is a lot of people unhappy with the fees and time it takes to transfer. 
You could have done everything you described in a single transaction 
">  This is very dangerous.

why?"
" Bitfury created two (2) individual transactions across a total of 3 payment channels on main net. This is not ""creating the lightning network"" without segwit, it's showing that payment channels are possible today, which was already common knowledge, and that with the right software, at least a single hop tx in the right circumstances is also possible. Also from the article:

>it seems increasingly likely that SegWit could be live within a month. This would allow for a version of the Lightning Network that offers an improved user experience....“The Lightning Network will be the most effective when used with SegWit.""

No one is disputing the availability of payment channels, the challenge is trustless, multi-hop routing; malleability is a problem for that trustless part without very specific circumstances.

Also, a few people having an on-the-spot laugh about the general nature of software delays on stage is of course evidence of *nothing*, as I'm sure you know. 

Of course, that definitely doesn't mean you're wrong either, and if LN really doesn't materialize in even a rudimentary working form on main net over the next twelve months I'd admit to betting on the wrong horse. But the [rapid growth](https://explorer.acinq.co/#/) in the testate version, both in terms of nodes and channels has been encouraging to me so far.

Market demand isn't the only thing that drives new technology. Particularly when there's no clear party to profit from the tech other than every bitcoin owner."
Yeah, but still it does not answer a question: how long would I have to wait if I put 0 BTC fee on my tx?
Came he to tip you because Roger used this in his CNBC interview :). /u/tippr $2.00
"> So you believe 100% on-chain is a viable scaling strategy?

No I don't. I think on-chain has to compete with off-chain and vice versa.

> If no, then why would anyone use off-chain layers if on-chain fees are near zero?

Its simple economics. On-chain competes with off-chain. The one that offers the best customer experience in terms of price, security, convenience etc wins. I actually think neither will ""win"" but that they will co-exist.

What I definitely do not agree with is artificially restricting block size the way BTC has done while we wait for off-chain solutions to be developed."
bitcoinfees.info is horribly inaccurate. I will post a transaction here when I send a cashout for my business later tonight.
"Sure, and it going to work way better on BCH with large blocks than it is on BTC with small blocks.

They'll make it up on volume
Why doesn't LN exist?  Because there is no demand.  People demand on chain scaling, that is why BCH exists.
If there is no bandwidth limit on transactions, then it encourages more transactions at low prices and removes competition for TX space. Block fees were supposed to scale that way and make up for the halving about every 4 years. Alas, we now have Yield Management in place.
"Segwit is a cancer and is not a secure or well tested system.

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin
That's true for both chains. Your point is?
Bitcoin Cash is the solution.
You have fell hard for the propaganda censored narrative.  LN does not work well.  I have read the whitepaper and delved deep into the slides on the Lightning Network website and I have complete understanding how it works.  It does not provide Tor like anonymity or security.  Its not as cheap as you think, you still have to open and close channels.  There are still many risks with LN and money can be lost.  People are just parroting talking points about LN and they have no idea how it works.  Even the creators of LN like Joseph Poon and ohers admit its shortcomings and have gotten into arguments with Core over things like Extension Blocks.  Lightning has been used as a political narrative to suit BlockStream Core's agenda.  I encourage you to look into [the nefairous interests that seem to be organizing against Bitcoin and BCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/).
Yes, I agree that this value is not deterministic - It's like foreseeing a future like you said. But still, one can foresee some events to some extent. What I meant, It would be nice to know, how long such transaction would take with a reasonable error, let's say, +/- 1 day.
"You are the one spreading lies, fees are currently over $16: https://bitcoinfees.info/

Non full blocks means low or no fees.
Oh shit I thought Coinbase does. Here's a list of exchanges that offer bch pairs, listed by daily volume from greatest to lowest: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets. Can't say if they sell for fiat though.
"Here is an example I just found on blockchain.info in 5 seconds: https://blockchain.info/address/1GzLvhQnxvtVRWCcvWHtu3EGtZc9qbZsbB

Now in order to send that 0.008 btc remainder it will cost another $15, completely illustrating my point.  I don't have to give up my privacy to prove I am not lying.  Show any example of your mystical low fee transaction.  Everyone knows you are a liar.  Why lie about such things?"
Yeah prove it to us, just like [Will Pangman did](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7j79eo/will_pangman_on_twitter_tried_proving_a_point/).
Not sure, but some wallets will tell you the fee and how many blocks like Electrum.  But its only a guess and estimate.  There is no way to know for sure what an appropriate fee level is or how long you will have to wait, since market and network conditions are dynamic and always changing.
"And 0 of them will be 'suitable' for solving BitcoinCore's problems. 

The goalposts will move again "
My point is that blocks will have to be *huge* to make up for near-zero fees.
The name does validate if your bank supports it. I bank with PN Bank, and if someone sends me an EFT with my business' name instead of my name, the bank rejects it. Admittedly this is the exception, rather than the rule.
There was nothing they could do to stop S2x since no one is forced to run the core client.  Yet they ran enough smear campaigns and FUD to make anyone trying to work on it simply quit.

"LN narrative is a hoax just do a search for ""Awkward moment at Breaking Bitcoin"", it won't be here any time soon, there is no market demand for LN."
LOL, what does that have to do with anything.
Central Planning incentivized segwit and forces people off of Bitcoin transactions into segregated witness transactions which is a much weaker and dangerous security model which removes signatures from the chain in a segregated scheme and only references signatures with a hash on the chain.  This is very dangerous.
The narrative about malleability and the need for LN was a [false narrative and Bitfury created LN without malleability fix or segwit](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qgngo/here_is_proof_that_segwit_is_not_needed_for/).

alright, you’re right.  I won’t give up my privacy, you’re right.  Though I sent 20$ to a person’s copay wallet and he had it valued at 19.54 instantly when he refreshed right after I clicked send.  I’m still not giving up my privacy to prove that, so you won this battle.  Enjoy your imposter coin.
">When you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.

Not sure I see why that follows, or how you're using the meaning of ""risk"". Reliability and capacity are not the same thing; are you talking about the risk of the network going down from some kind of attack, which BTC has proven very resilient against, or the economic risk that high fees lead to users migrating to lower cost options? The base layer of BTC is built to be very dumb, very limited in functionality (and by extension capacity) in order to place complete emphasis on reliability and security, which has been successful so far in my estimation, if maybe a little too conservative.

>What user autonomy are you referring to?

What I'm referring to is my concern that with BCH, low fees will be great, attract many users for everything from buying coffee to microtx tipping to larger purchases, which will look great for a while as tx volume grows until we start to see average block size in the 10+MB range and node monthly bandwidth get into the hundreds of GB Up/down. This will lead to most of the nodes, like the one I run on a laptop at home to have to drop out as full nodes and switch to complete reliance on SPV, further increasing burden on nodes until only miners and a few very large BTC businesses are running them. From there, I've effectively had to give up my autonomy on which consensus ruleset my wallet and all the coins I hold has to follow. 

Just those few entities will end up controlling both mining power AND validation power. Down the line when block subsidy drops low from halving and fees are kept ultra low with unlimited block capacity, miner/validators will just decide to raise the 21M cap. Slowly at first, sure, but arbitrarily if they choose, along with any other rule changes/selective censorship that benefit them, and there will be nothing to stop them because there will be no option to boycott their network and continue on with our own, because there won't BE one that isn't theirs, we'll just be following along.

That's more or less the root of the small-blocker argument as I understand it. A smaller, more expensive network that retains all the properties that make bitcoin valuable to individuals is better than a cheap network that everyone could join that gets captured and tilted to benefit those running it."
That's like saying that Bitpay is not useful because traders have the possibility of receiving fiat money. Do not you think?
...not with VISA, one of the main actors in the crusade against wikileaks (together with Paypal). The opposite emblem of the propositions of the Bitcoin ideology.
[unnecessary high fees. need Segwit now](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) 
I'm sure the fees will be exorbitant.  I have a wirex card and I can't recall the exchange premium because I never used it, but I want to say it was 5-6%.  I'm sure this will be along the same terms. 
Should it not say cardhodler ?

It’s a simple gesture to make Bch approachable imho. Btc could never support something like this. It’s heavy, brittle and hard to transport. Bch has scalability and a compassionate community.

Any idea what Roger's card is gonna be like?
Not yet. Would be incredible if they could give you the option.
Many seem to forget at times that the use of cryptocurrencies is strictly voluntary, and that some tools are designed for those who already use them, even though they connect them with those who do not feel prepared for it.
"In some cases, merchant (store owner) and cashier are one in the same (case 1).  

I agree that in most cases the cashiers are not the merchant.  A large portion of the cashiers wouldn't care (case 2), some portion (upwardly mobile) would relay this idea to the boss (case 3), and others would relay the message indirectly (""It I hear one more customer tell me about Bitcoin Cash, I am going to scream."") (case 4).

If 3 of those 4 cases, the merchant will eventually hear the message.  Not that the percentages are equal, of course."
Visa
"Exactly. 99.9%+ of stores do not accept Bitcoin. They are converting Bitcoin to USD. $20 says the bitcoins are required to be held by them, and not your own local wallet, that way they can credit transactions and deal with the bitcoin transfer to the processing company whenever they want.

Bitcoin hasn't gained any real retailer traction in years, and I guarantee you this isn't any different to the old 'solutions' to that problem.

The ONLY reason to get this card is to try and push bitcoin's legitimacy as a currency, otherwise it's a step down from just trading your btc for us and using a real credit card with benefits."
Agreed, which would make me concerned if Bitcoin Cash had high fees and people were being pushed to using Debit Cards to avoid those fees (ala LN).  Giving people the option to use Bitcoin Cash as a debit card (at least until more merchants accept it directly, is not worrying to me however.
I'm not paying for it.  Someone else wrote the merchant probably gets dinged for it.  Iff my latte is $3.65, I only get $3.65 worth of bitcoin withdrawn.   No idea if this will change in the future.

"Except most ""merchants"" are minimum wage employees who don't care. You'd have to convince executives that not only will it save them money, but that there's enough people using it to make it worth while, and as you've seen with steam and other sites, the second part simply isn't true, as rarely anyone is spending it for merchandise.

Also this wouldn't benefit you at all besides pump up bitcoins legitimacy. A store like Walmart or CVS or McDonald's isn't going to reduce the cost of their products by 1-3% just because a few people use Bitcoin to pay for things at their store."

I would agree that the white paper isn't a social contract that everyone agreed to, that it's simply a document outlining a new and novel method of transferring value. That said, I think censorship resistance as a prerequisite component is non-negotiable if cryptoassets are to redefine the industry (otherwise, we’re right back where we started regardless of Visa’s involvement). 
"The key difference is that Bitcoin Cash does not need this credit card to function. On the other hand Bitcoin needs LN to function properly.

So basically your comparison does not hold up. "
Any time you use a credit card, they own all the data from your transaction and can sell it to anyone. 
Also, it costs business owners to accept Visa (merchant fees) - so inform them about how they would have saved money if they accepted bch.

Will this work in Canada with CAD (without bank exchange fees) ?
You are right, the Bitcoin must be functional to be used even without going to this, which does not mean that this type of services can not be useful as long as they are optional. Things like this will help leverage the adoption of BCH and increase confidence, as they did with Bitcoin Legacy when it was still useful as electronic cash p2p.

Bitstamp has already added it, and others, and BCH has survived and looks like it's here to stay, so I'm betting they add it.  Besides, they've already been de-listed from bitcoin.org and I doubt they're afraid of being *double-secret* de-listed."
You are talking about two different events. Ot was forked from Bitcoin. Getting it listed on Coinbase is a separate and unrelated event 
Trump criticized it once (fairly), therefore everyone should hate it forever...?
"> It was a disgrace.

So you can't have an opposing view and allow it to air on national TV?

Ha, you are a joke. Just because you have an opposing view does not mean if you can get enough air time you cant' broadcast  yours..   
  
  
You sir, look very salty right now.   
**Have a good day.**  "
Buy litecoin or ethereum on Coinbase, send it to Bittrex, trade for Bitcoin Cash. 
bring a developer or two with you, invite legacy bitcoin folks?
"Indeed. Brian really backed himself into a corner trying to be political and I think he knows it. Much of that had to do with Shitcoin Core/Blockstream's continued threats to blackball CB for any dissent, as Brian did have his own voice once before the veiled threats to ""delist"" them from media circles.

The space has changed though, and he can and will be finally get out from under that shadow, the trolls are not his customers and can simply suck it."
You must be new to crypto because you're not talking about what you think you're talking about. Don't worry, you'll figure out the terminology soon enough.

Found it in your comment now: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7iyyti/you_have_100_worth_of_btc_so_you_purchase_an_item/dr2lov0/
CEX.IO works. Also Bitstamp.
Bittrex is where I buy mine, just note the ticker there is BCC. Buy ether on Coinbase, send ether to Bittrex and buy Bitcoin Cash with it.
I thought it isn't going to be traded on Coinbase, just given out to people who owned Bitcoin before the fork. Or am I completely wrong?

Now he can afford that CryptoKitty he had his eye on.
That’s an unrealistic expectation given the current market cap of BCH. Increased adoption leads to a higher currency price since currency supply doesn’t keep up with rate of increased adoption (which it fundamentally can’t). This is basic economics.
Torrent them. They might get taken down from YouTube.
there is a reason those guys wont debate. their arguments would be picked apart and exposed for what they are: bullshit
It was also a disgrace. Shame on CNBC for not doing basic research and having a convicted felon shill his own altcoin on their network. 
Financial segments were always the most tolerable

"If that ever happens, my biggest advice to you is to take a deep breath and relax. Joe Rogan's podcast is a long form interview. You won't have to quickly squeeze in high energy sound bites or continually repeat yourself. You'll have lots of time to talk.

I know that constantly being attacked by trolls can put you on edge, but Joe's a good guy trying to seek knowledge. It's not about you or him, but the big picture, and the largely untold story of how the private for-profit company Blockstream hijacked the protocol. Study up and bring lots of specific facts to the table.

edit: Also don't just be there to promote. It's good to diverge to other topics as well like libertarian philosophy."
I love long form interviews. And you could actually do the tests, sending BTC and BCH to Joe Rogan live on air, and let's see how much BTC VS BCH he could send to Joey Diaz. 
That would be a great interview!  Not only about BCH, BTC, and cryptocurrency as a whole, but also about your life story!

He said he sold most of his coins not 'only' half

U're posting it in r/btc, pal. Are u part of the scam?"
lol just shut the fuck up would you
I filled one out as well. This is the first time I went out of my way to do something like that, it's that important to me!
I think you want to believe the best in him. Fair enough, I listen to what he said and it doesn’t reflect well on him at all. Not did the comments about Andreas.
"> then i must be smarter than you

> this mother*****

I missed a point about intelligence"
The fact that they are still trying to defend 100$ fees is just crazy. 1-5$ fee is already too much for 95% of everyday life transactions. Without saying that it cuts out the majority of earth's population.
"Yes absolutely. Consolidating 100 inputs into one is sweeping a wallet. That you do it for yourself or another person as a payment changes absolutely nothing about the size of the transaction. The more inputs you have, the bigger the tx will be.

What core minions are saying is that people should routinely sweep their own wallets when the tx backlog is less shitty, and setting a non-priority fee, meaning it might never actually complete."
Yes it does, but it can be done efficiently. For example, you could wait over a 2-3 week time period for the network to be at a point where 10 satoshi/byte transactions confirm in 1-3 blocks and then sweep it
Using one address will not affect your transaction fees.  These depend on the number of inputs in the transactions you make, and this depends on the number of UTXOs in your wallet.  This will depend o  the number of times other people have paid you and not how many addresses you've used.
You obviously don't understand how wallet addresses work.
[deleted]
Yeah, it doesn't take several months to only develop the functionality to withdraw existing BCH from the fork. That would only take a week tops. And most of that time would be time that it's waiting for review.
LTC is less sound
I’m aware of this so I’m hopeful but would like to see them confirm.
Lower fees is accurate, faster will come with 0-conf support as developers realise that they no longer need to worry about RBF double spends.
"LOL, I don't need to believe a word Roger says. 

The truth speaks for itself. If you can't recognize it that's not my problem. 

Andreas, is not a believer, he says whatever he needs to say to earn money. If Andreas was half as committed as Roger he would have found a way to save some bitcoin. Roger did him a huge favor. 

If you think Andreas is the only early adopter who has fallen on hard times think again. "
Would that create a greater barrier to acceptance and use? If I'm Random Shop Owner, I don't understand the first thing about satoshis or bytes, and I want to accept crypto, wouldn't this cause a lot of confusion?
I get it now. Thanks.
"A person of high net worth definitely wouldn’t be as cunty as you. If you had “a shit ton” of both coins you’d be focused on capital preservation and focus on retaining and increasing your dividends, not attacking another community. 

 You have nothing. You bought high and are hoping for gains in bitcoin.  You are nothing, but an egotistical peasant. Go home. You failed."
[deleted]
Yes, 0-conf works, all it needs is for merchants to realize this which means essentially instant transfer. But I was talking about the actual confirmations being faster, as it may take many blocks on LTC to be confirmed while it takes just one for BCH.
Depends. If they're using a third party payment processor like Bitpay, it's not something they have to worry about. If they're accepting bitcoin directly, then yes... things like sweeping your wallet are extremely important to understand. And by the way... this goes for BCH too.
"> A person of high net worth definitely wouldn’t be as cunty as you.

"I think they have a much bigger update deploying next year that BCH is part of. Brian Armstrong has been *very* friendly to Ethereum lately, and it had been hinted before that other ERC20 tokens would be joining the family as well. I wonder if they might even be planning to integrate a DEX using the 0x protocol (would cream my jeans if that were true).

LTC will be cut off at the knees soon enough for ""cheaper"" coins. But until then, we can probably expect further FOMO highs."
Thanks for the link. I made a request as well. We need to sticky that link.
I have not used LTC myself, but from what I have read, LTC tx fees can run upwards of 0.50 or even close to $1 (much lower than BTC fees obviously, but still far higher than BCH fees).  Remember most BCH transactions cost only a couple of cents.
Hope you didn't hurt yourself
"I will do the same, Id love to see a Rogan interview
"
Watch the interview on the Rubin Report - he did great.
I think you are absolutely right. Roger could slow down and take his time, allowing viewers to really get to know him in a relaxed atmosphere. They could also talk about their mutual interest in martial arts. Perhaps Roger is too clean cut - Joe wouldn't be able to bust out the weed and booze.
"Wouldn’t Litecoin be even faster? And cheaper?

"> Bittrex

Did you notice there is suddenly a post on /r/bitcoin about Bittrex stealing people's money?  Coincidence?"
"When I watched that video when it was first published I thought to my self this is the most clear message any one could give to get out of MtGox ASAP, without actually saying get your money out of MtGox ASAP. 

Short of blinking in morse code that MtGox is doomed he did a great job of communicating like a hostage. "
"No and no, search for ""median transaction fee"" and ""confirmation times"", you know what, here you go:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-bch-ltc.html

I was unfortunately unable to find confirmation times but since on BCH it gets always confirmed in the very first block, I'd expect it would be faster for lower fees"
"you are arguing just like him, i'm richer, then i must be smarter than you, just like he embarrassed himself and all of his supporters in that interview when he started to talk about how much money he has even before bitcoin, pathetic, is this your role model? really !!! how fucked up you are people !?!?!

someone is arguing with him, he can not keep up with him, so he start saying ""I'm a multi-millionaire"" and asking the other side ""how much money do you have?"" like having less money is a despise?

seriously guys, people here are one of two types, either stupid as fuck or paid mercenaries. END"
">He divided the bitcoin community for his own interest, simply put.

No, that was the Core devs, and Theymos and his crew."
I was only trying to fit the guy I replied to's viewpoint into a better analogy to get his own viewpoint/message across. I wasn't imparting any of my own thoughts on the matter.
Doesn't the wallet-sweeping process itself cost fees?
Sweep more, more fees. Sweep less, more fees. The low blocksize cap just completely breaks BTC, leaving it like a body so riddled with tumors it can barely move, and every mitigation attempt just makes it worse.
[deleted]
You're even more of a newbie than I thought.
But that doesn't mean anything at this point
"They only publicly said they will allow people to withdraw the BCH they are entitled to due to owning BTC before the fork, BUT if you follow this space or watched any of the recent interviews Brian Armstrong has done it is clear as day that they will be adding BCH to their services. I speculate that they don't specifically say they are going to because they don't want to get dragged through the mud again by r/Bitcoin.

Here is a good interview with Brian: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-12-07/coinbase-ceo-on-crypto-surge-bitcoin-futures-irs-video"
Upvote 4 sticky!
How did he divide the community?
"Just sell your BCH if you want to impact the price.

BItcoin Cash is almost immune to just words."
It's posts like the one I'm responding too that degrade the general quality of r/btc.
"The analysts didn't seem scared off. They looked excited: ""You're telling me there's an even bigger opportunity than Bitcoin and no one's seen it yet""?"
Good job!
"/r/bitcoin is losing their minds right now.

I think he went a bit too far in his argument against BTC."
Great interview, go get 'em u/memorydealers 
Funny how only people that have already invested in it are pro BCH:) 
I love it how he specifies Bitcoin Core. I'm doing the same as much as I can whenever I have to talk about these two
Did he flip them off?

The only thing this man is intrested of is Pump and Dump. Should have put Andreas there instead.
"Hmm Roger Ver.. he’s the guy who told everybody their BTC were safe in MtGox just before the crash and mocked Andreas for promoting Bitcoin and living off it as a currency not hodling recently right?

He’s become arrogant and is a poor figurehead for Bitcoin Cash - tempting to call it BCash on principle at present."
"Great interview.  
The more exposure Bitcoin Cash has the better.

Unfortunately the video linked here is shorter than others. It does not include the other moderator/guest saying that he thinks BitcoinCash is the better investment."
So bitcoin Cash is rising to becoming the Top soon ? Just not long ago SBI also prefer BTH ? which we invest in BTH now ?
"I just can’t understand how you guys claim to belong to decentralized economy and at the same time worshipping this mother*****

Yea but bitcoin is $16,000 - How are you gonna beat that?  I mean people look at that and think you are scamming them with Bcash. They see you as a used car salesman.
Such a propaganda shitfest. I used to like this subreddit but it turned for the worse. No better than r/bitcoin
"Lightning Network is just around the corner. People are going to lose their asses.

This is not good news."
Roger, any plans to stop lying that bitcoin transactions take up to $100 in fees, or do you feel the need to make up exorbitant numbers is essential to proving your point?
No one realizes that this in mainstream media just causes FUD from crypto in general?
Yet here y’all are chatting it up under another coins ticker symbol. Sad.
Last stop to fool town
Fees are high again. He’s winning. Btc community refuses to adopt simple Segwit lightning solutions. He will win if this community continues to slag
Awesome interview. This is so bullish for Bitcoin Cash. Im suprised core hasn't dropped a bit. I guess the core supporters are hesitant to get off the trainwreck that it is..
Awesome, great work Roger!
great news, i hope this shuts up the ver doubters even from r/btc
If the noobs could buy this on Coinbase we’d be at $3K right now. We need to get Coinbase to list it.

Lesssgooo. 
Wow! great job Roger.
Donnie, is that you? 
"good job Roger  u/MemoryDealers

some points for u to ponder on

1) by using the label bitcoin CORE , the public can find it rather misleading, first core means essence , do u really want to give that kind of inference to the untutored public to imply the  ""ESSENCE OF BITCOIN"" ?

2) calling them LEGACY has a certain elegance, they got a wonderful legacy from Gavin, and we got a wonder legacy from Satoshi, as the public are well aware , legacies can be squandered or put to use for the greater good

3) i know u'r attached to the bitcoin blank brand that u know and love so well, but trying to re-appropriate that is counter productive now . By calling ourselves bitcoin p2pcash or bitcoin BCH or other such snazzy title shows how we're different, we are peer to  peer , we are bch, we are cash , we are pop = popular .....
unlike legacy 's s2s sidechain to sidechain

4) the genie is out of the pandora's box, and the bitcoin blank brand will no longer fit back in the box...
squabbling over a BATTERED ""bitcoin blank"" so confuses the public. 

5)  legacy's model will take fees AWAY FROM from the miners who are paid to make it secure.... that's why a 1 penny fee for all  sounds great , but if we say 1 penny  gets u into the 2nd or 3rd block, that gives us  a way to grow the fees / tips for the miners

 but the bewildered public can understand the SIMPLE CONTRAST 

 ...legacy redirecting fees away from miners = less secure blockchain

....p2pcash giving all fees to miners = more contribution to security

6) no one has a monopoly on bitcoin blank, we need to educate the public that the free market gives choice 
[bitcoin] legacy / BTC versus  [bitcoin] p2pcash / BCH just like pepsi [cola] versus  coke [acola]

7) when p2pcash / BCH reaches a critical mass then having r/btc is a hindrance, because the BCH  brand will be more popular / well-known  than BTC/ legacy and trying to re-appropriate the [by then ] meaningless bitcoin blank would be a VERITABLE HOOT.

"/r/btc is a scam, do not ever go there for any information. It is essentially a blockchain replica from 1st of August.
This split mean one thing only, it is designed to steal bitcoins. Quite simply, under the guise of ""being a bitcoin for the future"" by multiplying the network transaction from 1mb to 8mb...
This narrow minded scope only lead to this current mess called bitcoin cash tm not to be confused with Bitcoin (core). They are both very different things.
What it means for you, if you originally had BTC and have the option to ""exchange"" your Bitcoin (core) to Bitcoin Cash, they are essentially taking your private keys and handing you back monopoly money. Or if you have Bitcoin Cash (of they like to call BCH), then you better sell it quick because you have been scammed."

A business for example, may very easily have a complex transaction with 100 inputs or more. At 129 satoshis per byte, this would currently result in a $247 fee."

Must be why we always find these spam comments here, on facebook, youtube, twitter, everywhere...
"There are extremely important technical, economic, and philosophical conversations and debates about the protocols and state of BTC and BCH to be had. That's exactly my point.

I'm objecting to something else entirely... the petty trolling and tribalism. People starting with the mindset of: *there are bcash people who are stealing my Bitcoin and there are core people who are paid shills for the banks... mix and trolololol*

I want to cut through the nerdjock tribalism so I can get good information about the important conversations we need to have."
"There are people who consider themselves ""bitcoin core people"" or ""bitcoin cash people"", and they see others that same way.

People stake claims on cultural elements like words with no rational or even internally consistent justification.

Simply for trying to understand what is going on with either of these two coins, I've been accused of being part of a conspiracy to defraud people out of their bitcoin. Also, I've been accused of being a paid shill for core for the same reason.

"No.

Whether everyone who holds BCH is part of a conspiracy to defraud people out of BTC is not an important discussion to have.

Whether everyone who holds BTC is part of a scheme to manipulate markets and establish a crypto oligarchy is not an important discussion to have.

Arguing about whether widgetcoin or mumbletoken is the ""true blipblorp"" when no one can state clearly and logically what it even means to be the ""true blipblorp""is not an important conversation to have.

"Does that link explain how I was recruited from the Hillary Clinton campaign to be a ""segwit justice warrior""?"
"I can give a tl;dr version for now.

Basically, Bitcoin arose out of a radically libertarian, cypher-punk space. It was meant to be a tool for establishing a sound money unfettered by banks and governments, which itself would be a tool for freeing people from their tyranny and establishing freer markets.

Since about 2013, when Core devs came on the scene, they've steadily and implacably changed the properties of Bitcoin to no longer allow such to occur. Instead they've coopted it into the status quo. Bitcoin, as BTC, has lost almost all of its revolutionary capability.

Bitcoin cash represents the effort to continue Bitcoin under the aegis of its original mission of freeing the financial world. Imagine a world where there is not only separation of church and state, but separation of *finances* and state. That's what the early adopter of Bitcoin like Ver et. al got excited by, and what prompted anyone to buy Bitcoin in the first place. 

Hopefully this should give you some idea of why the disagreements are strong. They're motivated by deep convictions and desires. It's not about some silly game of identity or tribalism. It's about the future of finance on a fundamental level."
There was a bit of space prioritized for zero fee transactions and old coins would get a bit of a boost too. It was nice but I'm not too sad about this going away as it wasn't really market driven.
Cute.  You thought you had a point that you were going to convince me with.

That could be an issue, but even if there was a way to sort tippers in general higher the questions still wouldn't necessarily have to be answered in that order.
You got me all excited!
That was an outburst of unexpected laughter that my neighbors probably heard.
Tell people to be more constructive when RES tagging. I tag them with a guesstimate of how much % chance it is that they're a fake user, and I update their tag as I see more from them.
100% agree with you here. The tribalism is a huge distraction.
You fundamentally misunderstand the situation. 
You're actually starting to sound like a troll now. Those are real straw man arguments. Never ever have i heard anyone here accusing BTC-*holders* of being part of a conspiracy or being bad people. What we oppose are paid astroturfers, censorship and the willful destruction of Bitcoin as a functioning currency.
Why are you going around blaming everyone for someone else's comment? Especially when you're not bothering to link to it?
"But you have experienced someone accusing a poster of being a troll because that poster described an experience that the someone hadn't experienced themself.

Your last comment is *exactly* what I'm talking about."
"I once responded to someone who said that BTC cannot scale, and that any coin that cannot scale dies. I pointed out the contradiction in that statement (if BTC can't scale, and coins that can't scale die, then BTC must be dying, but by all measures it's thriving) and I was told ""that's the store of value debate"".

I was immediately pigeon-holed into one of these two tribes and treated as if what I was saying was a crafty manipulative ruse to push an ulterior agenda I apparently have. He had a pre-existing conflict that had nothing to do with me, but I said the wrong word or expressed the wrong opinion, and he irrationally incorporated me into that conflict.

It immediately derailed the conversation, because anything I said got filtered through that narrative. It was intolerant, intellectually dishonest, and counterproductive to having the real conversations that both you and I agree need to be had.

What exactly am I misunderstanding here?"
"I definitely might be. It's also possible that I'm referring to a different situation than the one you are. There are likely other possibilities either of us have not thought of.

My point is that I want to get good information to use to think critically about my assumptions and beliefs. Please, enlighten me about the situation."
yawn....here ya go [buddy](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate)...and look at the nice downtrending orange line for Bcash on CMC. 
"I get that concern. But Im not sure I agree in some magical egalitarian vision of crypto you might have. I think of it more as a meritocracy. Anyone can share ideas and I think that's maybe where there's some egalitarianism. But you could say upvotes and downvotes take away from egalitarianism. So I'm not sure I totally agree. 

 In theory tho anyone can ask anything, if it's a good question the upvote mechanism is still there. This just adds a bit of gamifying for Q and A style posts. As well as security on a post that is likely to be visited by the Corey's. Or alternatively if someone doesn't have a couple cents in their tippr maybe there's a way for someone else to tip on behalf of the Q. Or even someone could tip that user then that user could go back and edit their comment to provide a tip. 

Donations could go to a charity or fund or something. Might be a good way to monetize little events like these. Its almost like that website that lets you email famous people if you pay X amount. Realistically you could probably email them or tweet them without paying. You're just paying for the increased odds.

Except this is true.

Why do you think I don't understand the situation, simply because I would rather talk about all the stuff you mentioned in your last comment, rather than being accused of deliberately trying ""to distract away from Bitcoin Cash? Is it because Bitcoin Cash removed the Blockstream code that disabled instant BTC transactions?"" because I asked about something other than the precice thing he thought I ought ask about?

I'm on your side, here. I was aware of the things you mentioned in your last comment. I'm not uninformed. I just want to be able to talk about this without everything I say being filtered into someone's *pre-existing favourite thing to argue about.*

For instance, I want to be able to object to trolling without someone treating me like I'm objecting to talking rationally about BTC and BCH. Do you see what I'm trying to tell you? You kinda did the thing I'm objecting to.

>You fundamentally misunderstand the situation.

Since Bitcoin Cash is closest to the original version of Bitcoin, why don't those at /r/Bitcoin hand over the reigns to /r/btc moderators.

The sub happens to be pro-BCH (since it's a big blocker sub) but it wasn't really pushed by the moderation, it's just the current circlejerk if you prefer. I think it's pretty normal that the sub goes one way or the other when it's uncensored.

This isn't a BCH subreddit. We have BTC news going through quite often, we're just anti-Core biased (yet I've seen quite a few reasonable pro-Core comments on the top of a few threads)

What transparency do you want?"
Awesome idea!

Bitcoin cash is the fork of Bitcoin closest to Satoshi's design.... So yes, it is his creation. Bitcoin Core is not.

Understandable, I think it will be worth it in the long run, so Im holding onto a few coins including btc and eth that I think will mold the future of crypto. I understand that its kinda expensive to send smaller transactions *at the moment*, which is why I hold or send in larger transactions in which the fees compared to size is small enough for it to be worth it to me.

"Tbf Taxes are more extortion than outright theft.

Also that's an anarcho-capitalist stance (no taxes at all, everything privatized), which is only a small subset of libertarianism. I don't run around accusing democrats of supporting a communist uprising. 

I get that a lot of reddit has a bizzarely major hate boner for any and all non-left political views but being accurate tends to help the circlejerk stay alive longer.

Given that a depressingly large amount of not only redditors but the general left leaning population genuinely believe Republicans pass laws specifically because they hate poor people/minorities, I guess having your knowledge of the opposition essentially limited to memes kinda leads to that inevitably.

">Do you think Bitcoin will continue to be a good investment if it cannot be used for anything other than holding?

yes at least for a while because of all the speculative fervor

however with the recent lightning test on mainnet things are looking extremely bright for its use as a form of payment

all that being said, i do not believe crypto will ever ""dethrone"" fiat and become insanely valuable

let me say it to you straight up.  all this talk that roger spouts about ""bank the unbanked"" ""think of the africans"" ""change the world"" is complete bullshit.  all he cares about is fame and power.  since he is likely the largest holder of bcash in the world he stands to greatly benefit if the price shoots up.  do you really believe he is out there making payments and conducting commerce with bcash?  he is a SALESMAN by trait, did you not notice how in the interview when he ragequit he had 0 crypto on his own wallet.  every single person who shills a cryptos transactional nature is NOT mainly using the coin for commerce - they are hodling.  sure they may buy something small here and there, they may use the tip bot once in a while, but they are mainly hodling as a form of speculation.  the entire transactional appeal of cryptos is a farce designed to increase usage and therefore increase the price for hodlers and early adopters via metcalfs law.  

now as a thought experiment lets say that the world did actually adopt crypto as a transactional method (meaning they actually set up the infrastructure to actually accept crypto, so far the only vendor to do it is overstock.com, all the other vendors use 3rd party intermediaries which instantly convert to fiat defeating the entire purpose).  i would still back bitcoin over all others.  i know you are trapped in the rbtc echo chamber but the reality is that bitcoin has all the nerdiest smartest dudes working on it.  look at the main proponents of bcash - roger (the largest holder in the world gee i wonder why he would pump it, also a salesman and completely non-technical).  jihan (also non-technical, just like roger he is making a play for power/influence by supporting bcash).  craig (infamous charlatan and scam artist, has not contributed anything to the crypto scene).  if i go down the list of the people who support bitcoin it's literally a who's who of the smartest mother fuckers in the crypto space, maybe even the world.

"Ryan Charles is a retard with some media website.  He is completely out of touch with reality which is evidenced by his videos about s2x and how he thought it had community support. Peter Rizun was lead dev for a previous altcoin which failed miserably, he keeps claiming that segwit is unsafe but when challenged to prove it he never does.  Don’t know the others.  

The lightning test was on the mainnet.  The fact that u think it’s far away just shows how deep in the echo chamber you are. 

I don’t care about Adam Back.  Check the bitcoin GitHub, he doesn’t contribute much.  

Bitcoins network is working fine from my point of view.  It has a 99.99% up time with very stable blocks. Like I said I don’t buy coffee with it. "
Gold is a tangible item that has had value for thousands of years, Bitcoin is a currency thats worth is dependent on what it can be traded for. If BTC is not intended to be used a currency, then what is its wealth determined by? Coinbase?
">I saw the Roger Ver interview today and decided to check you guys out

Ah, that could be an explanation, alright.

The reason people talk about Bitcoin Cash here is this sub is about Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is the closest thing to the original Bitcoin there is. The development of the original Bitcoin got infiltrated and steered away from the original goals of Bitcoin; Bitcoin Cash split to steer things back in the right direction."
Sorry that we thought BTC was intended to be a currency
Why does this sub identify as BTC? Isn't it counter productive? New people may come here and get the false impression that Bitcoin Cash is BTC (because that's the fucking subreddit name), and it looks like everybody here is talking shit about Bitcoin Cash. What a clusterfuck. 
this shit made me laugh, props
You spend it because its intended to be a currency, if nobody uses it as a currency then its only purpose is essentially an IOU from an an exchange.
[deleted]
"BTC is up 150% because ""Investors"" are artificially inflating the price. These people have no intention to ever spend BTC and as far as they are concerned BTC does not exist outside of coinbase.

Logically speaking, a currency is only worth something if it can be exchanged for goods and services, and we are reaching a point were few people will take BTC due to high fees and long tx times."
I can sent money with Paypal for a 3% fee, why would I ever bother with BTC when Paypal is cheaper and faster?
"Its pretty secure if I'm in possession of my private keys I feel confident nobody is going to hack it because a few hashes are quantum hard (SHA256) the other part elliptic curve cryptography isn't quantum resistant but BTC code is upgradable and could be patched if it fails so not worried right now. Definitely more secure than centralized bank account plus I can move my money anywhere in world anytime I want. Not just Monday through Friday from 9am to 5pm. Sure $10 fee but I'm not going to move this money very much only when needed. Superior to gold in that I don't need a boat to transport it across the ocean and trust a 3rd party. It's like storing my money in a grain of sand and telling someone to go find it. They could go get a million friends and still won't cover the ground needed. Very large numbers quindecillions basically secure private key making super computer look slow at 1million guesses per second. 

This has to be worth something. "
"Logically speaking, a currency is only worth something if it can be traded for goods or services, and with BTC that used to be the case, however with BTC we are seeing De-Adotion, companies like Steam have decided its not worth it to take BTC anymore. Unless BTC scaing issues get fixed its fucked as a currency, and its only worth will be essentially what an exchange says its worth.

Satoshi designed BTC as a peer to peer electronic cash system, but if you have to open a coinbase account to use the lightning channel to transfer your coins to someone else quickly, how is it better than Visa?"

I believe this sub predates Bitcoin Cash and was created as a place to discuss Bitcoin without the censorship on r/bitcoin. 
This is a pro bitcoin sub. So both bitcoin and bitcoin cash are discussed freely without censorship. /r/bitcoin bans you if you discuss off topic subjects like alt coins and bitcoin cash. 
Curious how I've seen so many people asking that today...
"Whats bad about spoke and hub? As long as it works, the user is happy. 
Litecoin works for small transactions, its instant and... yeah it just works.

This subreddit says that /r/bitcoin bans them and stuff, but I get downvoted myself for just being skeptical to Bcash, with legit reason. 

A king who must say he is the king is no true king"
I understand the shortcomings of btc, but I asked what he meant by bitcoin 'losing' last November.
"I suspect when BTC crashes the whole world will see all crypto as just ""Oh thats like that Bitcoin scam"" and it will take a long time to recover from that."
"5000$ × .03 = 150$...

Why in the world would you send a fee of 150$ on the blockchain network"
"I suggest you do some research about money and what makes money good and bad

Transactional overhead is not a primary concern for intelligent people

That is why bitcoin has all the smartest people backing it and bcash has raving lunatics like Roger lol"
"i never said buying a tesla is not stupid, it is.  im just saying i did it anyway because, whatever, spend some, stimulate the economy yadda yadda.  ever heard of the bitcoin pizza?  coffee disappears down my throat in a matter of minutes.  a tesla on the other hand provides me with immense utility and enjoyment.  

as for the economic aspect of it... there is literally no incentive for me to make payments with crypto rather than my visa card.  in fact, there is disincentive (bitcoin pizza).  since visa and cash are WAYYYY more efficient than any crypto this relegates crypto to being a speculative investment asset and a store of value.  and it is incredibly strong at this because of its deflationary and immutable properties.  buying coffee with bitcoin is akin to taking a 747 for a 1 mile trip."
"I saw the Roger Ver interview today and decided to check you guys out, I have to say from an outside perspective the fact that this sub is called BTC but is really a BCH sub is confusing. In other words, the fact that the sub is BTC but only talks about BTC in the context of ""BTC shills"" is a bit weird. "

Someone made a good analogy. “Fiat is to gold as lightening network is to bitcoin”
">Whats bad about spoke and hub? As long as it works, the user is happy. Litecoin works for small transactions, its instant and... yeah it just works.

paypal and visa already offer this. and if LN was as successful as its creators intend, paypal and visa would just continue on existing and offering LN users a transactions on/off ramp. woooahhh. what a mind-blowing paradigm shift!

this is a flaw in reddit's design that is true on every single sub with voting enabled.

I bet if you asked him his reasoning, it would also apply to bch. Which might be an inherent problem with crypto.
"Maybe I want to give a friend 20-100 Dollars. People make 20-100 Dollar transactions significantly more often then they make 5000 dollar transactions.

Yes, the machine spits out receipts that you can scan/swipe. Or you can send bitcoins and receive fiat back (only gbp at the moment)."
That is a none-issue. What is an issue (to customers and to the ATM's) is congestion and high fees (both these are losing people money, the business and customers).

Do you mean some kind of specific ""announcement"" saying something like ""Bitcoin Cash is now Integrated"" ? 

We have not done that for any of the others. I've already had someone express their concern that Bitcoin Cash is being given more ""special treatment"" than any of the others integrated, so we will likely just keep it to the same level of announcement as when we integrated dash/ltc/eth.

The home page is a static page, its not an announcement page, we use the blog site for that (you can scroll down on the home page and see the latest blog/articles)."
"As I said, the way these are run its a ""non-issue"". If for some reason whatsoever the machine sent BTC to a BCH address on their receipt (or vice versa) the most likely scenario will be that the customer will be reimbursed and/or the correct amount sent to the correct type of address. But technically, it's a non-issue.

That said, if you have these issues when using a Satoshipoint ATM feel free to contact us via https://satoshipoint.io/contact/"
"Why doesn't satoshipoint.io say that Bitcoin Cash is now integrated?

"
">Why doesn't satoshipoint.io say that Bitcoin Cash is now integrated?

The home page never does say ""X is integrated"". You need to look at the blog site and facebook as I linked above. The same was done for Litecoin, Dash and Ethereum. Bitcoin Cash will not get special treatment, it can work for itself on its own merits.

Yes. Bitcoin Cash means capacity will always be ahead of velocity. **No overloads ever again**

or do you think 40 transactions a second is all bitcoin will ever need?"
"> false. Volume is around 1/1o of BTC's and

more like 6% and not growing that much: https://fork.lol/blocks/size"
the fees have nearly doubled in the past week
"It was my understanding that a UTXO was a subset of addresses, of which when traced through the chain can be shown to have some value ""in"" them. (Ie ""unspent"")

Thus a UTXO is an address, but an address is not necessarily a UTXO.

If an address A has 1.0 of coin X, and spends 0.5 to address B, 0.4 to address C, and 0.1 as the miner fee, then address B is now a UTXO with a value of 0.5, and address C is now a UTXO with value 0.4, and address A is now ""spent"".

In the converse situation, if address C has 0.4 and B has 0.5, they can be two inputs to a new output, D, which would have 0.8 (while 0.1 is a miner fee).

Thus... if AA uses a vanity address which thousands of people send small amounts to, the value ""in"" this address is the summation of all inputs.

In the event AA spends from this vanity address, the vanity address is *the* UTXO, as all of the thousands of small amounts were already spent *to* this vanity address.

If I am mistaken, could you point me to a resource that illustrates my misunderstanding? I am deep into reading ""Mastering Bitcoin"" by Andreas himself, and also looked at coding raw transactions, and played around with various libraries... I was fairly confident in my understanding, but perhaps I am missing something."
"I have no idea how Ethereum works. Can't comment.

I think you're still misunderstanding me.

I wish I had a whiteboard..  haha..

Ok.. say you just created a wallet. You ask your friend to send you $100 in BTC. You receive $100, but your friend is sad because they also spent $10 to send it to you. (And therefore is out $110).

So, now you have $100 in BTC, and some miner somewhere is $10 richer.

Now, you ask a different friend for $50, but give them a new address. They comply (wow, what nice friends!). They send you $50. But they are also sad, because they had to pay a $10 fee to send you $50.

So now you have two addresses, witch a total of $150.

And somewhere, another miner is $10 richer.

But now you decide these people aren't your friends.. because they are silly and like to spend $10 fees.

So, you find a new friend, and they ask you for $130. You comply (pay it forward, right?). So you send $130 to your new friend. You pay a $20 fee because you are sending from two addresses.

And somewhere, a miner is $20 richer.

And you have no money.

Now, rewind.. when you are about to ask tour second friend for $50, you mistakenly give them the same address you sent your first friend.

Your wallet again, has $150 (but only one address).

Now, you again find a new friend, and they ask you for $130. You comply (pay it forward, right?). So you send them $130. And pay a $10 fee. So your new friend has $130. And you paid a $10 fee.

Your new friend buggers off now.

Boo! You have no more friends..

But yay! You still have $10! Sweet!

Oh shitz. In order to spend it, you need to pay a $10 fee.

You have no money.

You have no friends..

Should have used BCH.
"
"Small amounts.. Sent to the same address.. results in high(er) fees when spending from that address? :O

... what...the...bleep...

Uh.........

Uhhhhhhh.........................

....

I thought BTC was broken but if this is true it is *orders of magnitude* more broken than I had thought.

I am having difficulty believing this simply due to the sheer magnitude of how much more broken that would make it.

(Also that I apparently(?) Haven't read a comprehensive clear technical description of transactions)"
"This sounds very close to my understanding.

My understanding though, is that if I send you 1 bitcoin to a fresh address your wallet creates, and my wallet needs to use up 1000 unspent outputs within my wallet, or it only needs to use 1 unspent output, you don't care. Your address becomes a UTXO with an associated value of 1 coin (inferred via tracing the chain back).

I'm deep into ""Mastering Bitcoin"", and played around with multiple libraries, looking at building raw transactions, and created multiple vanity addresses. If my understanding is wrong, I must have missed something pretty fundamental. If that's the case, can you point out what I'm not getting?"
Pro-tip: Always verify and, if you can, back up with concrete examples or evidence.
What is this lightning network and why is a bigger block better?
If there is a huge influx of use-age for bch and it becomes mainstream, let's say I pay nothing, and others are paying small fees. Will mine be pushed to the end of the block, or something? Thanks!
Roadmap is the removal of blocksize limit
"> if bch had btc volume it would still not be saturated

That's kind-of the point. It's not like the stupidly low block size limit is something that just happened and everyone was powerless to do anything about."
"Yes, less than 10% currently excluding spikes. Day averages are more telling: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-bch.html#6m

BTC price is rallying. While it's happening, Bitcoin Cash growth will be pretty slow. Faster than Bitcoin's growth in 2010-2011, but slow"
"Yeah, it doesn't quite work like that. [Here is a good explanation of transactions and inputs and outputs.](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-transaction-really-works/)


If you have Address A that's received 1.0 BTC in a single transaction, that address has one utxo. If you send 0.4 BTC to Address B, you take that utxo and use it. Once you use it, it's not unspent(the U in UTXO) anymore, so you have to use the whole thing. Your transaction would take that UTXO as an input and the outputs would be 0.4 to address B and 0.5 back into your change address. Anything leftover, in this case 0.1, becomes a reward to the miner and that's how fees are paid.


Edit: reread and it wasn't very clear. This example tx is creating two UTXOs, one to B and one to your change address. If you've received two transactions, you can spend both UTXOs as two inputs to a single transaction. The more inputs you include, the bigger it makes the transaction. They don't have to be from different addresses, or even the same address."
Idk how much time you spent writing that ELI5 version of Bitcoin fees, but that doesn't change how transactions work. Your understanding of addresses and what a transaction consists of is wrong.
I agree that you should be using BCH, but in this example it's still two inputs, even though they're coming from the same address.  Still a $20 fee.
yes because the blocks are 8 times bigger and will keep increasing in size.  They are not designed to be full.  The BTC core devs chose to have full blocks on purpose because they want a 2-layer design (lightning network).
">You pay a $20 fee because you are sending from two addresses.

That's not how it works. What matters is UTXO's, not the number of addresses."
"> But calling people out for ignorance when one is mistaken oneself is best avoided.

Yeah that was stupid i removed that. Guess i was wrong here, thanks for the explanation."
"That's not correct.

If AA's address holds funds received from 100 different tx, then he has to pay fee for those 100 inputs to move the total sum. If he moves these funds with a single tx, then it's the next address which has one input and pays only ""1x fee"". 

As said above I had a mining contract where a miner sent me ca. 0.0002 BTC daily to a single address. My adress had accumulated over 500 inputs from these miner transactions, which made it ridicilously expensive to spend. I tried to swipe it all to a new address (so it would create only one input.) with a lower fee than recommended (recommended fee was more than the address held) and it got stuck. Even tx accelerators were asking for over $1000 to accelerate it.

1 BTC is not simply 1 BTC anymore."
Yes, that makes sense. You can simply hand select not to include those dust inputs.
"Yeah, and in AA's case, that is one unspent transaction output from his perspective.

Sending one cent into his address does not create dust, since it's just adding to that existing unspent transaction output (address).

I am not saying it wouldn't cost $15 to send $0.01 to AA's address. It would.

"
I believe you misidentified my motives, and overlooked my logic.
"Yes, more inputs is more fees. But those fees are paid by the sender not the receiver. Anyone thinking of downvoting now, needs to read the rest:

From AA's perspective, if he does spend from his address, *his* address is the unspent transaction output, or ""input"". (He has a single reusable vanity address, and does not create a new address for each person donating to him)

It makes no difference from AA's perspective if 1 person sends him 1 BTC to his reusable vanity address, or 100 people send 0.01 BTC. His vanity address will have a value of 1BTC either way. However, 100x the fees would have been paid (by the senders)."

"This was my understanding, but it seems it is more complex than this. *typically* there is a1:1 ratio of address to UTXO. However an address can have multiple UTXOs associated with it.

It's apparently very important to know that a UTXO has an address, but an address is not actually a UTXO. An address may *have* a UTXO. An address may also have multiple UTXOs.

If bitcoin cash had similar traffic would the fees still be low?
Thank you
"no thats a pump and dump. if you look at November 12th on this graph you can see one

So that 30 cent fee that was paid by the twitter guy. Five dsys ago and is still nor confirmed. Unless you want to wait two weeks you'll have to pay at least $2 and maybe you'll get a confirmation in a day or two.
I'm not comparing anything. I'm just stating facts. Even if BCH had BTC's volume, the fees would still be around 1 sat/byte. 
That's false. Volume is around 1/10 of BTC's and growing
OK then, you have nothing to prove what you have said :)
the median transaction fee of block 498876 (40 minutes ago) was 385 sat/byte, 400 sat/byte is not high at all, it's the new normal at the moment
"Because you have to choose one and he choose this one.  I'm guessing your point is ""why did he have to show one with such a low fee?"" It's to make a point.

How would you feel if you sent $15 to him and he only received $1.50? "
">...since it's just adding to that existing unspent transaction output (address).


No, you're mistaken. An address is not a UTXO. An address has many UTXOs from all the transactions they've received. When you send a transaction, you take a collection of UTXOs and send them to multiple places. Each recipient now has an additional UTXO that they can include in future transactions.
"
Bitcoin is different from Ethereum. Ethereum doesn't have UTXOs, from what I understand. They have accounts and balances. When you send $0.01, it increases the recipient account's balance like you're describing. Bitcoin is not like this, as I described in my other comment.
That's not how bitcoin works mate. When you spend, the input part of the tx is all the UTXOs you're using to spend, and the output is the UTXOs you're creating to transfer the value. So if your ONE address has 100 UTXOs worth 1 cent, your transaction for 1 dollar will contain 100 UTXOs, so the tx size will be VERY large in terms of bytes.
Yeah, receiving a large number of small transactions isn't a great idea because each transaction received is an individual UTXO. Your outgoing transaction then has to reference all the tiny UTXOs in the address which makes the transaction take up a lot more bytes and more bytes = more fees. It gets to a point where the cost in bytes of including a particular UTXO in your transaction is greater than the UTXO is worth. In that case you can hope fees go down one day or you can effectively donate your BTC to a miner. 
Your first paragraph is correct. My address doesn't care how many UTXOs you used, there's only one input in my address now. BUT. In our andreas example, if people were to 'spam' him with many small donations, then his wallet would have many UTXOs, and would take more fees to spend as each UTXO increases the tx size in bytes.

"Hmm. Thanks for spending the time to help clarify.
Honestly though, I'm still not quite getting it. I will sleep on it and re-read/look for more details...
I was *really* under the impression that a UTXO was simply an address in a specific scenario of not being spent yet.

I entirely get that you can't spend a portion, and all must be spent..  and this is why some transactions have accidentally had massive miner fees because the person making the transaction didn't realize any un-defined spending was automatically presumed to be a miner fee.

It's frustrating that inputs and outputs are .. not addresses? If that's the case I have no clue what is going on at all.

I'm a reasonably intelligent person. I cannot fathom how insanely confusing payment channels and nLockTime and onion routing concepts would be to the average user."
"Things are starting to become clear to me, I think... Here's my understanding on why my prior understanding was seriously flawed... Following my PRIOR understanding, the following could happen:

If you control Address A, and want to send to address B, and change to address C, that cryptographic signature of that transaction would be X.

Now.. say someone sent you more coin to address A.

If the owner of address B was malicious, they could just re-transmit the *SAME* transaction, and steal coin from address A, sending coin to address B and C.

Clearly, this would be a terrible design flaw... THUS.. it seems that the design is such that if new coins are sent to address A after the first transaction, address A now has *different UTXOs* associated to it. Thus, invalidating a re-broadcast of the first transaction.

Once this dawned on me, it became pretty obvious that an address, even if re-used, will *not* count as the ""same input"" for a later transaction."
"If the data is already there to point the one 1 bitcoin transaction, or ten 0.1 bitcoin transactions to the address, why would a transaction need to refer to that data, not simply just the address?

To a lay person such as myself, it seems like redundant data, in that a miner or validating node could infer ""where"" things came from, and that the value of the spend is valid.

I'm not seeing why a transaction would need to include historical data of prior transactions, rather than simply state the associated address those prior transactions relate to.

(I'm fully aware there is no concept of a ""balance"" anywhere except in a wallet which calculates the balance bases on historical events stored in the chain)

Edit: and thanks to those who are taking the time to help explain the details. This is unintuitive."
If an input is a previous output, and an output is a destination address, doesn't that mean that an input is a previous destination address?

By the time we get there, we will have ways to reduce the burden on the networks.  By the time we get to VISA levels, the hardware to run the network will be the same cost as it is today.  Unless we hit VISA levels next year, your fear is unfounded.  If we hit VISA levels next year, I will give you two BCH, which should set you up for the rest of your life.

All of that said, businesses, transacting on the blockchain, will have nodes, probably a few. They will be in datacenters and they will be server class machines.  Satoshi predicted that.  I am still not seeing the point where anyone holding Bitcoin today, will not be able to afford the hardware to be part of the network, tomorrow, next year, or next decade."

No problem. Generally it's good practice to create a new address for every new transaction you receive, maybe that's what you're thinking of. If you're creating a new address every time, each one will have a single UTXO that you can use as input to a transaction.


>I entirely get that you can't spend a portion, and all must be spent..  and this is why some transactions have accidentally had massive miner fees because the person making the transaction didn't realize any un-defined spending was automatically presumed to be a miner fee.


Yeah, nearly every wallet software calculates this for you and automatically creates the change address. Some of those had to be custom software or someone crafting a transaction manually.

"Look at the raw transaction data. The inputs contain more than just the address, they contain a full reference to the UTXO.

Block explorers make the network easier for us to process, but bitcoin balances aren’t explicitly kept in the Blockchain. You don’t spend from addresses. You spend from transactions. To make it easier to visualize the block explorer showed you the address associated with the transaction input. 
No, those are just addresses which form *part* of the data in a UTXO.
"I'm not sure if you've got it yet but if not, I'll try and explain cleanly.

Every Bitcoin transaction must reference every Bitcoin *transaction* that funds it. The address is used only for signing and thus it doesn't matter if addresses are reused or not.

It would be nice if there was a ""spend all transactions sent to this address"" but there is not. And there is not likely to be either, not least because address reuse is discouraged but likely for other reasons (may be non-deterministic since it is possible to create a transaction from unconfirmed transactions).

Things like Schnorr signatures, if they are implemented, might alleviate this a bit but the basic principle still applies."

Make a new address(A). This shall be ""Andreas' address""

Send a bunch, (say, 10 txs worth $1), of small transactions from anywhere to address(A). I'm simulating donors sending small amounts to Andreas

Send the entire content ($10) of that address(A) to another address(B). This is akin to Andreas trying to spend his donations.

Take note of the tx size from A to B. You'll see that the tx will consist of tiny inputs (due to the many UTXOs from 'donations') from A, to one output into B.

Do this test with BCH. Take note of the fees. Then multiply by 300 or so. That's how hard it'll be for Andreas to spend his dust (borderline impossible)."
No. The inputs are not addresses, they are previous outputs. The more outputs being used as inputs, the larger the transaction size and thus cost.
"I don't really know much about LN.. Bigger blocks aren't really ""better"", but they do have advantages when you reach a certain transaction amount. When you have smaller blocks, less transactions fit in that block, so what you have to do is outbid (increasing your fees) your competition so that the miners will check your transaction sooner. With bigger blocks more transactions fit into one block which means you don't have to pay high fees for your transaction to go through since there's enough room for everybody."
"You know how in the Olde Days you'd deposit a lump of gold in a bank then you could write bank drafts against your lump of gold?

LN drastically changes security model of Bitcoin and miners' incentives. Do u research. It's pretty complicated and was criticized by many. And surprise-surprise Bitcoin Core with LN **would have to** have bigger blocks too. Or some channels won't be able to close properly, disrupting the whole economy
"It depends of the **economic feasibility** of this transaction for each miner who won the lottery. While we've no miners' dependency on fees alone and almost none big enough 0-fee txs, all txs will get confirmed in the next block

With skyrocketing of usage (1000x+) fees will become more prominent part of miners' revenue, thus, they may discriminate more carefully plus average amount of inputs will grow due to multiple divisions of coins, thus, less and less 0-fee txs will be confirmed in the next block (or not)

"I read what you wrote a few times, and read that link for a second time (I had previously found and read it to test my sanity earlier).

I still haven't noticed anything that conflicts with my understanding. :/

A check of my understanding:

Is a UTXO a ""tip"" of a chain of transactions?
If so, is that tip identifiable by an address?
Is the number if UTXOs equal to the number of ""tips"" of transaction chains?
Is an output identifiable as a destination address?
Is an input identifiable as a source address?
Does a transaction represent a list of inputs and a list of outputs? (Among other things like the hash ID)
Is the size (bytes) of a transaction dependent on the number of inputs and outputs (plus some effectively constant overhead)

If none of the above is incorrect, does it not logically follow that AA spending from his vanity address would look something like:

Input: AA's vanity address
Output: some random address, and some change address

I don't see where the transaction could contain any information regarding how bitcoin was previously sent to AA's vanity address, be it 1, or 10000 separate transactions sent to AA's vanity address.

Isn't it up to the nodes/miners to look at the chain history to identify the historical activity that feeds into AA's vanity address, not the encoded transaction of spending from said vanity address?"
Can you point me to a good resource? Clearly what I have read thus far appears to be flawed if you're correct.
lol the irony xD
"Whaaaaat?

So if someone sends me 1 bitcoin to one address, who happened to have it spread across 10000 addresses in *their* wallet... It will cost *me* more to spend that 1 bitcoin than if they sent me 1 bitcoin which was only spread across 2 of their wallet addresses?

This makes no sense to me. I must be missing something pretty fundamental here..."
"I fail to see the distinction.

How would his wallet have many UTXOs, yet only one address to spend from?

I thought that looking up the historical activity leading into an arbitrary address was a task left to miners and validating nodes. I don't see why that historical activity would be encoded in a transaction spending from the vanity address.

Edit: I appreciate the discourse."

Yeah, the tip of a chain of transactions is a pretty good analogy. Mostly all of that is correct. An input is not identified by an address, but rather a UTXO. Transaction outputs belong to an address, and an address can have many UTXOs. You can't just say you're spending X amount from Address Y. You have to specify which UTXOs to include in the transaction. To spend a UTXO, it requires a signature from the address that owns the UTXO.


This enables nodes on the network to keep just a ""pruned UTXO set"", which is essentially just a just of accounts and balances. The balances come from adding up all the UTXOs that belong to each unique address. When blocks come in, your UTXO set gets updated and you can delete most of the history. I don't think many nodes use this, but it's possible.
"
"I'm also on a quest to better understand the protocol, so I don't know either, but:

From my understanding you don't really send BTC to an address. You publish transactions that are unlockable with the recipient wallet's private key. When the recipient wants to spend it, he doesn't have a balance on his address. He has transactions that are unlockable with his private key. When he wants to make a transaction, he has to specify the transactions he wants to unlock to create it, thus every input to his transaction costs fees."
Check the link in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7j7ain/here_is_someone_sending_andreas_antonopoulos_a/dr4jt58).
No the number of inputs into tx only matters to the sender. In a standard transaction you would receive the payment at your address as one output. The inputs are combined by their tx into a single output. That single output is then available by you to spend. But the important thing to recognize here is that coins aren’t kept in addresses per bitcoin protocol. Coins are kept in transactions. So an address could have one bitcoin at it, but that may be tied up in one one bitcoin transaction or in ten 0.1 bitcoin transactions. They spend that money by collecting the transactions. New transactions use old transactions as inputs on a protocol level, not address balances. 
"From a basic level, isn't a transaction effectively:

Inputs (address1,address2,...addressn) --> outputs (destinationaddress1,destinationaddress2,...)

My understanding was that in the scenario above, address1,address2,... are the UTXOs.

Then, once the transaction is written to the chain, destinationaddress1... becomes new UTXOs."
"What's funny is, the bigger the transaction the cheaper this is to do, because the size per output would make the transaction cheaper for each extra output.

1 in 1 out = 192 B or ~$10 (~$10 per output) It would cost $10 to spend that 1 output.

1 in 2 out = 226 B or ~$11 (~$5.5 per output) $16.6 to spend those 2 output.

1 in 200 out = 6958 B or ~$340 (~$1.7 per output) $1450 to spend those 200 outputs.

Holy shit!

"The formula for non-segwit transaction size is [roughly](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/3011)

So dust (or more like ""gravel"" these days) can be 5 times cheaper to create than to spend - if you do it in bulk. Though obviously wallets should be smarter than to spend it.

(really I just needed an excuse to hunt down that formula - been meaning to ever since knowing transaction size has meant the difference between your fee leaving the transaction stuck or not)"

It seems that normally, a UTXO is associated with a single address. However, a UTXO is not actually an address. So, a single address can have multiple UTXOs associated to it. Thus, when multiple independent transactions are sent to a single address, the number of UTXOs *still* goes up.
Spending from this one address still utilizes the multiple UTXOs associated to that single address.

Hence, a 1 cent donation to AA's vanity address still creates an additional UTXO, which will count as an additional input upon spending."
Nube here why is that a face palm?
"Gonna have to change one of ""the three biggest lies"" to ""Your payment is waiting for confirmation"". Perhaps another to ""I'm from Core and I'm here to help you""."
Core failing doesn’t make it a Ponzi. It just makes it bad tech.

It's not Andreas' fault. Blockstream made BTC unstable and many, Andreas included, are blind towards economic consequences of it
"https://bitinfocharts.com/de/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m

Difference is that BTC median fees actually are that fucking high.

Oh my god Becky look at her ~~butt~~ mempool

There's no fee situation in BCH. 1 sat/byte gets in the next block no matter what.

Honestly man, this seems a little petty. With the SBI and prepaid-card news, capped with your interview earlier, you should stick to the high road. JMO
Can you please move your hate to your own sub? I know love your bch but this sub is called btc and that equals bitcoin. It's funny actually 
So we agree
"What is interesting is that the 1.50 will add an extra input to Andreas' wallet, so it may cost him $14 or at least more than $1.50 to move the $1.50.  Will his wallet recognize this and freeze the small dust tip of 1.50?  Or will it bundle it in his next transactions causing him to lose more money?  There must be some threshhold where an extra input in the wallet is costing more than it does to send out.  So wallets will need to start accounting for this and freezing ""dust"" inputs up to $17 or whatever fee level.  Eventually [$1000 dust levels will be frozen by smarter wallets](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).  Oh the unintended and unthought of consequences..."
And Andreas will have to pay another $10 to cash it out to fiat.
"funny these people are saying ""well if he just used a segwit wallet"" **facepalm**"
Core supporters promoting alt coins to buy coffee as usual... and that fees are still low and that there is no reason to use BTC. They really do believe their own bullshit.
lol, BTC could not suck any more if it tried
Use tabs. Lol. https://youtu.be/aUgL-4fx2JE (Adam Back implementing lightning tabs)
That moment when you sell out for the side that can't send you money :D
If Bitcoin Core ends up crashing due to lack of usability, I hope Andreas has the decency to take responsibility for misleading millions of people into a Ponzi scheme. I appreciate what he has done for the bitcoin community but at this point, staying silent to the corporate interests of Blockstream makes him lose credibility among the people that understand the technology and makes him partially responsible if it implodes taking money away from million of average Joes while the rich make even more fiat from shorting the hell out of it. 
Do you know it all depends on how many inputs and outputs in your transaction? Please do make $13 fee transaction in BCH, don't just talk, let's demonstrate your point.
Negative mutual profit not good.
Ouch

Use litecoin to send small transactions says the biggest scammers the world have ever seen aka scamstream.
Bitcoin has ''Jumped the Shark'' Peak Bitcoin has just occurred. Its Bitcoin cash now for the win
Transactions need to refer to each prior transaction because you need to prove that you have the unlocking script (signature) for each input necessary to spend the funds from that transaction. The locking script is associated with each transaction, not the address, so you need the unlocking script for each transaction as well. 
Let's not nuke Andreas with small BTC donations,  let's send some Bitcoin Cash his address.  
I heard a distant cry...
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/bitcoin] [Roger Ver continues to focus on Andreas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ja7kf/roger_ver_continues_to_focus_on_andreas/)

"I know fees in BTC are high, but this post is very demagogic. I do BTC transactions on a daily basis, and I never needed to pay 13$ fee (I paid once 5$, but it was for an urgent case). It's even more ridiculous to pay 400 sat/byte for donation transaction, that is not urgent at all! This ridiculously high fee is the fault of the user who doesn't know to control the fees, and it's not related to the network congestion.

I could also make a 13$ fee transaction in BCH and upload a screenshot of it, but it won't really say something about the fee situation in BCH."
"A better way to explain this is to think of every UTXO you receive as a coin. Now when you go to make a transaction you chose which ""coins"" you want to spend, but every ""coin"" you choose has to be fully spent in the transaction. You can choose to send any ""change"" to a new change address or back to the address it came from, but the default is new address.

In most wallets all of this is done automatically by either 

* A. choosing the least amount of inputs to make the transaction and sending the change to a new address.

* B. spending everything and sending the change to a new address. 

Some have advanced features where you can chose which ""coins"" to include, just be careful because if you don't spend the full ""coin"" the remaining portion goes to the miner as the fee."
what type of currency requires users to 'know how to control fees' to use it. Do you have any idea how easy it is to use fiat?
That's now how it works. The fee depends only on the transaction size, not on the amount being transacted. In any case, if it's change being sent back to the sender's wallet, you can't really count that as the intended transaction amount.
"I'm with you here and i don't understand all these downvotes... 
They all pay into one address and if Andreas wants to use that money he makes a transaction: 1 Input (the address everyone payed into) and 2 Outputs (1x where he sends to: 1x unspend). This would be the smallest transaction possible so the fee would be the . 

If everyone would pay into a different address he would have to use all these addresses as input, but that's not the case."
because even though you might get a discount with segwit, its still going to be pretty high fees.  Segwit doesnt really increase capacity that much.
"""store of value"""
"Promoting a digital asset whose only inherent value is that you can sell it to someone else for a profit is pretty much a Ponzi.

Bitcoins used to have inherent value, as their low transaction friction gave them innate utility."
they were margin called based on today events. 
It's a stupid idea. No one knows the tipping point
"> ple into a Ponzi scheme. I appreciate what he has done for the bitcoin community but at this point, staying silent to the corporate interests of Blockstream makes him lose credibil

Just looked at the charts and it's 14$ for the median BTC fee."
This is exactly what I said. You can get to next block with low fee, but you can still pay 13$ fee, and it'll prove nothing.
there is also no volume. why are you comparing saturated network to non-saturated?
And why should I throw 13$? It will prove nothing, as I said.
The screenshot shows one input. And 400 sat/byte is high fee, and it doesn't matter how many inputs you have.
I dunno. I thought about it myself. It might be interesting if there was a donation tracker which compared the two.
Yep, I agree it's a legitimate criticism. I think he could have made the same point with a less charged example.
Nothing. Just, why'd he post this example? There are (I imagine) hundreds of low dollar/high fee transactions on the ledger from the last few days. Why point out this one?
There's no free lunch. Also, IOTA has a coordinator
"And their lecture slogan is the opposite of Andreas's: ""Bitcoin CAN scale."" Y'know what, maybe miners do deserve the lion's share of his donations. I know who I would rather have coffee with. (But they would have to pay for it with Bitcoin Cash.)"
Core at its most brilliant /s.
That's not how Bitcoin works.
Thats not how bitcoin Works. But thx for burning btc.
More inputs = more fees. That's why merchants pay $100+ fees. Core has totally killed the tip jar use case. Another one bites the dust. (Picture Gmax in biker attire running over use cases one after another: commerce, mixing, gambling, lossless value storage, and now even tipping.)
"Unfortunately, that's not how Bitcoin works. Ethereum does work like that, afaik, but not Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions use the UTXO(unspent transaction output). When you send 15 transactions to one address, there's 15 UTXOs (not including the UTXOs for change back to the sender). If you want to include more UTXOs in your transaction, it costs more fees. It's as if it costs $5 per bill to spend cash. It's not worth it to spend $1 bills if a $5 item costs $25.


Edit: it's like pennies. Nobody fucking wants pennies because it's too much work to spend it for it's value. It's not worth my time to bend over and pick one up on the street."
Let's not.
r/bitcoin continues to focus on Roger Ver
This is the uncensored Bitcoin sub, where a, dare I say, majority of subscribers believe that is the fork currently known as BCH.
"Remind me which blockchain this happened on?
"
I don't view this as being petty. It's a legitimate criticism and fundamental flaw of the Bitcoin system. That $1.50 is basically toxic Bitcoin, where trying to use it costs you a bunch of extra money on top. 
This *is* what Roger said in the interview. What's wrong with a real-world example?
Use the arrows
"If it ever works.

The more I learn about IOTA the less sense it makes. There isn't even any incentive structure to ensure every node actually bothers verifying transactions.

The game theory analysis I have seen are based on good vs bad actors. But lazy actors (free loaders) are actually a huge problem, because they appear to be good but provide cover to the bad. I haven't seen any mechanism in IOTA to prevent free loaders which is worrying.

Then there are all the other issues that people call FUD, but I still think are real worries.

But yes if it ever works as planned it will replace every other blockchain crypto."
"okay lets play ""which coin can get a tx into the next block for less fees"""
IOTA doesn't have fees but your node needs to calculate two more transactions

"> I hear the miner gives good lecture too.

They give on-chain lectures for $13.46."
"yes

edit: it will cost you a lot in fees though to mess with someone.  Some wallets could get around it by using coin control."
So what you're saying is... we could reduce effective circulating supply of BTC by forcing people to freeze their BTCs, then watch as the dwindling supply go to the moon? Sounds like a plan to me. 
"Wouldn't this be an attack that some malicious miner could use? For example they could send 1000 dust tx (and mine it in their own block) to some donation address to render it useless?

I used to have a mining contract with ViaBTC where they sent me ca. 0.0002 BTC daily for over a year. Needless to say when I wanted to sweep that adress it proved hard and the tx got stuck. Tx acceletators wanted over $1000 for clearing those, which is more than the address holds."
"More like make them accidentally waste money if they don't pay attention to tx sizes / fees before sending and/or make it inconvenient to send if they do notice/know what to do.

The Bitcoin Core windows client makes it relatively simple to work around this so it wouldn't make my wallet useless if you did it but I guess my first step to fight it would be either:

* wait it out, if I thought TX fees would come back down (wait for fees to be near the 7 day low would be the least I'd wait).

* Send an TX out manually using all the small tips and not care if it confirms or not just to get my wallet back to a more convenient state

"
Yes, he'd have to manually put inputs to decrease fees afterwards. But his inconvenience'll cost u a buck
Minimum of 10 Andreases needed to deposit. 
Always a convenient excuse...
"i love how luke jr responded to this but its downvoted way at the bottom LOL

never change rogers cult, er i mean rbtc"
"Both my storage and my Internet connection do scale pretty similarly to Moore's Law.

In any case crypto will either increase these storage and bandwidth demands or fail. The only difference is that we now run ETH, BCH and LTC nodes to accommodate the demand."
"Relying on Moore's Law is a fallacy.  Moore's law is already starting to fail in terms of transistors on a die, and it never applied to storage or networking in the first place.

Running a node with a 100GB blockchain isn't too expensive: but running a node with an 800GB blockchain is a lot more. And, most importantly, it isn't 8x more: server costs don't usually scale linearly, with high end servers and large bandwidth allocations costing a premium.

I admire other cryptocurrencies trying to do better than BTC.  What I don't admire is all the FUD against BTC in order to try to get ahead with your token of choice.  You weren't successful in bullying your way through consensus, so now you are practicing sleight of hand, preying on naivety to sell your ""re-revolution""."
