Your question is confusing. 
"Learning about this stuff is hard, if only for the amount of information you have to cram in.  Block size only matters when figuring out the throughput of transactions in the Bitcoin network.  Really I'm not sure what you're confused about but it sounds like you have some information that says big blocks are bad.  If so that is incorrect.

An analogy:
If Bitcoin was a shipping company then the block size would be how big their fleet is.  It doesn't make sense if the company is growing in popularity and getting more demand for their services to reduce the size of the fleet or keep it the same size.  They would expand the fleet as needed to meet the demand at that particular moment.

Obviously this isn't a perfect analogy but i hope it helps clear up your confusion."
"The entire debate over block size is just FUD, mathematical illiteracy, or downright maliciousness coming from core.

The numbers, for those that care.

My constants:

- MemStorageCosts: $0.04/TB
- BandwidthCosts : $2/GB
- TransactionFees: $0.03/tx (10x lower than minimum credit card fee)
- NumberOfNodes: 45,750 (10x more than on SegwitCIAMI6chain)
- AverageTXsize: 250 bytes

The cost to the network per tx is then:

NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.02

The profit per transaction is:

TransactionFees - NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.01 / tx

At 1GB block size, the TX throughput per year is:

(1 gigabyte / 250 bytes) * NumDays * NumHours * (6 blocks / hour) = 2 x 10^11

which results in profits from tx fees to network operators of **$2.1B**.

On the segwitcoin network, we get about 2 segwitcoins per block in fees or about $420M in revenue.  We won't bother calculate the expenses, but just assume it is all profit.  1GB blocks produce *profit* of $2.1B for network operators on BCC from fee collection at $0.03 per tx, over 5x the *revenue* of fees for segwitcoins.

---

In short, everyone who tells you we need small blocks is:

- mathematically illiterate, or
- a malicious actor trying to destroy bitcoin

If we wanted to increase tx fees to $0.15 (2x lower than minimum credit card charge), run blocks of 1GB, and do it all with 5x as many full nodes as segwitcoin, the total *profit* to network operators would actually be higher, *just from fees*, than the coin generation + fees *revenue* currently on segwitcoin network."

2. That 90% miner is almost certainly Jihan.

Interesting, I kept reading threads it was one Miner/group controlling 80%+ hashing power. thank you for the links.
"> ASICBOOST

Jesus, this again? filling it with 8 megs would have nothing to do with ASICBoost. ASICBoost is about reordering the transactions, as you mentioned, and would not need 8 megs worth. Maybe they might need to add one or two more transactions in order for ASICBoost to work, but not fill the block up.

This ASICBoost is really tiring. Segwit is a softfork, so that boost still works with segwit activated. If you really believe that was the reason for the resistance to segwit then you are seriously misinformed.

> Whoever the 90% miner is is filling the blocks with spam, BCH doesn't have enough usage to naturally have 8mb blocks and no one else would bother to have the cost of the fees.

I am not aware of the number of miners nor what they mining percentage is. You claim 90%, but who are you? Why should I trust this number you claim is truth.

millions of nodes was never the intended plan, nor necessarily desirable. 
"They might also filter out the ""free money"" when they determine that it would result in them producing a block whose large size makes orphaning likely enough that the ""free money"" isn't worth the cost of claiming it.

Oh don't worry, it'll be addressed by the market. RIP the value of BCH.
This demonstrates why a block-size limit is not required: miners will include the amount of transactions they can handle, and stop when they can handle no more, at which point there will be competition for block space. If they can handle 8mb blocks so choose to create them then clearly they're OK.
"they filter out that ""free money"" (it's not free) when someone posts a 2sat transaction to replace it. "

"Eh, it depends.

Assuming a straight up 8x throughput increase over Core with full blocks (ignoring SegWit for now), BTC would need a fee that's 8x higher than BCH for the fee profit to be equal. So that's $0.8 for Core vs. $0.1 for BCH.

At the low point in August, median BTC fees were around $0.7, and they've only gone up since. If BCH wants to be fee-competitive, it will need to keep blocks full enough to drive fees to a median of around $0.3 or higher. 

Of course, fewer miners means the fee gets split up less, so there's that. Realistically, though, assuming miners do what's most profitable, mining should end up roughly equal in profit on both chains once the difficulty settles."

To fill a Bitcoin cash block will take ~14000 transactions. To force a $2.50 transaction price, the spammer needs to fork out more than $200,000 per hour.

Whatever happened to that transaction someone made which was just over 1 MB and had a ton of anyone-can-spend outputs in it? It was an incentive for bigger blocks, made before the fork. Did that ever get mined?
Ah it's appeared again for me too...very odd
"maybe, but I highly doubt any new mixer service will come online and broadcast itself in this manner giving the recent issues of bitcoin/money laundering and the use of [Mixers](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tracing-66000-bitcoins-what-we-should-learn-from-btc-e-story). It could potentially happen, but I don't think this is mixer work. this seems like a potential intentionally *spamming* of the network to prove a point.  
  
Let's not forget, someone with the hashing means is intentionally doing things to (seemingly) make Bitcoin Cash [more of a fighter](http://bitcoinandtheblockchain.blogspot.co.nz/2017/08/smoke-and-mirrors-and-good-game-of-poker.html) against Bitcoin.  
  
As it stands right now, giving the current climate of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin blockchain matters, I'm still on the fence about what is exactly taking place within the Cryptocurrency realm. 1 thing for sure, and 2 for certain... Someone is building Bitcoin Cash up to rival or overtake Bitcoin (BTC)."
"And, amazingly, you could upgrade your whole system around an Intel Pentium G4520 ($99 cpu + $40 mobo) and cut your power pill by [25% and double your performance](http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Pentium-G4520-vs-Intel-Core2-Duo-E7300).

Raspberry Pi? No. ~$200 box, 60w, that can process 38k txns in ~2 seconds? Yes."
Miners are always free to reject low-fee transactions if they believe there is a spam attack. 
"35.000 tx each worth less than 0.00USD and a **total** tx fee of 0.00USD ... Thank god bcash is saving Bitcoin by keeping satoshis vision alive! lol

I was considering spending part of my bcash to bloat the blockchain with useless tx but spending some bch bag holders money on electronics was just more tempting. Turns out you can bloat the blockchain for 0USD what a surprise."
There was no transaction over 1MB included in a block yet.
So what's the TX/Sec up to if we continue to see these large blocks?
"So easy...

`min_tx_fee=0.00000015 max_block_size=8mb`

cha-ching!"
"I hope they will enforce such a policy and not mine obvious spam.

I still wait for mining pools to publicly display their recommended/minimum fees that they are willing to mine, but mining pools are more inclined to please their hashers with all kind of stats, that Bitcoin users. Sad about that."
">Miners are always free to reject low-fee transactions

I don't think that will happen. It's in any individual miner's interest to include all fee-paying transactions they can fit into a block. So some miners may not include those transactions but then it becomes more attractive for other miners to defect and pick them up for themselves."
Hi. The server is currently down for maintainance. Your tips will be sent when it is back up.

"> until satoshi dice came along and ""spammed"" the network with lots of tiny txs

Which, to be fair, put the spotlight on a number of deficiencies in the software where it didn't handle that many transactions very well. A lot of skepticism against untested block increases come from that. Some people even advocated black listing those transactions, none of which reached consensus. But the problems would have been crippling if we had an order of magnitude larger blocks back then."
i agree, it does look fishy.
"I call it working because it is. The point of 8MB blocks was to show on chain scaling.

Just compare the two mempools over the last hours to see how well it is actually working. 

And many people said it wouldn't work."
Trying to spam this will only bring attention to how easily BCH can clear the mempool.  Even if fees get pushed up to 10 cents mining will become a lot more profitable.
That's default logging on Bitcoin Classic client. I'm looking through how to make it log less! It's spitting out 15 lines of stats for every block.
"They told us that even 2MB blocks are dangerous!  

If 2MB is the end of the world,  is 8MB the end of Blockstream?"
Good. It disappeared for a moment there 
Bitcoin does ~3tx/s, Bitcoin cash should do about ~24tx/s (8x) with a similar transaction mix. 
"Wait... So how is this meant to scale long-term?

It's still way behind Visa and PayPal."
Yeah, figured that! I'd just love to see the miners filling blocks if they're able. I mean, why not!
Did you hear that he's finally going start running a full node again, thanks to Blockstream Satellite?
"[Some is sending quite a lot of transactions today](http://i.imgur.com/lfyHoL0.png). While I wouldn't want to accuse anyone of 'spamming the memepool', this does seem to be abnormally high, to the point that it's hard to envisage any other scenario. The good news is that the network has no qualms with handling transactions with really low fees.

could be somebody launching a new mixer service
Damn, that tipping bot really got out of control.
No, people are getting confused by spam txs and intent. No txs that include a fee are spam. Don't accept a lie because it currently fits your narrative.
"What we should look out for is the the ATV (average transaction value) and  ATFV (average transaction fee value). This will help poor people like me save the pennies:

ATV: 45.46513539
ATFV: 0.00280998

Looks good from a consumer point of view. This is what the press should be reporting on.

"No, to assume that BTC chain at $4000 isn't hitting 280K real transactions a day is ridiculous. 

You seriously think that after 9 years and millions of users BTC chain is not at capacity? "
As the OP, I can say that I am pro Bitcoin. If you are pro Bitcoin, then it's us guys, not you guys. And whichever side of this fork experiment comes out on top, well I have coins on both chains - I'll still be pro Bitcoin.
If there is a fee it's not spam
Did the 8M block disappeared? 
"> To force a $2.50 transaction price, the spammer needs to fork out more than $200,000 per hour

I don't understand. Why wouldn't an attacker pay really low fees to fill the blocks?"
So if we need 32mb blocks will that also be OK?
