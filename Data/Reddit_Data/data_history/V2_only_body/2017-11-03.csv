BCH is the new Dogecoin

"Please help me understand, as this is a major point of confusion for me.  

I'm about 2 weeks into this, and already I've repeatedly heard (as you just stated) that BCH will soon carry the BTC name ... I've also heard that SX2 will carry the BTC name.  

How can all 3 carry the name?  Who controls this sort of conflict?  What am I misunderstanding?"
soon to be BTC is pretty strong, it will take years to kill a fork like that the current main Bitcoin Fork.  
I used https://wex.nz/ to trade BTC for BCH
Perhaps the 'Segwit' could be more considered as a future scenario when LN is done and the chain is still restricted to 1MB/1 lane.
Yells the bcash guy from the other side!
Am I understanding correctly that free thought/expression is suppressed at rBitcoin?  How is that healthy?

"the difficulty algorithm is a bit out of whack, and occasionally is >20blocks/hr or <2blocks/hr.

but in practicality, the delay you see is probably just varience. I sent a $5 fee bitcoin transfer this morming where it was about 70minutes for the first post-tx block due to varience in the bitcoin network. thats natural (even if unfortunate)

however, my $5 fee (260sat/byte) hasnt confirmed in any of the 8 blocks since, which is ridiculous and caused by the mempool backlog"

This is what tilts me, they absolutely can coexist and you’re right that they’re used for different things 
Of course they can. BCH is designed to be able to co-exist with BTC.
Was a bit skeptical about BCH first but really love both equally now. Both stand for independence from crooked governments and shady bankers, and that’s more important than how you achieve it.

"> Why cant BCH and BTC coexist in harmony?

People will always find a way to create constant tribal conflict.  Example - ""In n Out sucks because I prefer Five Guys.""  It can't be ""I prefer Five Guys"", there's gotta be an ""In n Out sucks"" inserted in there.  
They'll find a straight line and through their constant inner trauma, turmoil and noise will find a way to make it convoluted.  ""Here's a thing.  It's not perfect but it works nicely.""  Oh no, we gotta split and fork it over and over and make it twenty confused and competing fucking things, glossing over the faults/limitations on ""their side"" while amplifying and distorting the ""other side"".  Noise, noise, **noise**.  I'm sick of it."
"The tolls go to 2nd layer solutions (in 18 months. The diagram should show ""plannned"" over that section). The small block size has to do with failure to anticipate and implement necessary capacity planning (or more correctly, to remove temporary protective measures)."

BCH _can_ do both.
BTC is not  'fast and cheap to transfer' so it can only do one.
So which coin is better?"
Was this drawn on a paper towel?
I will. It is the most recognisable one, it has the biggest value, it hits All time highs every week, it has great devs and has proved itself many times since 2009. Meanwhile you can go to your centralised Jihancoin. It tried to steal Bitconnect coin's ticker but it also failed at that.

Hey! There is only one Dogecoin!
"> And the institutions performing the segmented transactions do not charge for their services?

I believe you're confusing ""a segregated-witness transaction"" and ""a lightning network transaction"". Any segwit-enabled wallet can generate a ""segmented transaction"" (for no cost difference from creating a standard transaction). The proposed lightning networks include the possibility of middlemen charging a fee to go through their existing channels, if you want to use them as your middleman, but that's not required."
Blocking the stream
I don't know technicals, all I know is a traditional transaction is more expensive than a segwit transaction. For me, that makes this image innacurate.
Even if we're talking about LN, an extra lane is still a misleading analogy. The LN channels would be buses or something.
dont understand being downvoted as it just proves the point
it’s not. hence the popularity of this sub
"Freewallet is one of several custodial wallets on the market, however, it doesn't automatically make us a scam. 

By the way, we're working on a way to enable exporting/importing private keys without losing the benefits of the cold storage technology we offer; this feature should be available soon."
Not trying to take sides but actually understand. In my experience segwit transactions have been much faster and cheaper. What about BCH is supposed to be 80mph?
"Can you explain how analogies work next, because I'm a little confused:

The blockchain is like a highway. Blocks are like... uhm.. lanes? Then legacy tx are the cars. And the new segwit tx are... lanes! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"For most of Bitcoin's history, there was more capacity than was in use. This is called foresightedness. Especially when it costs nothing to have that extra capacity available.

Unfortunately, while Satoshi had the foresight to set the block size limit high enough that it would allow for expanding use for half a decade, a bunch of idiots ended up in charge and failed to move it up when it was needed."
I don't see why not.  But why can't BCH be a store of value as well as fast and cheap to transfer?  I don't understand this.  I don't see how the two are mutually exclusive.
"You gave quite the passive aggressive answer without really giving any insight, haha thanks.

"
"Yeh I mean why cant we push both agendas?

Even BCC slappies should want to hold some BTC if not for anything else but to have another asset that stores value extremely well.

BTC's properties just so closely resemble that of physical gold, why cant we continue to push its agenda as a 'physical gold crusher' and then let BCC continue on a separate path of being the most efficient / secure / lowcost p2p instant payment system.  The two communities (BCC / BTC) should want to work on these agendas in harmony and not try to sabotage one another.  Its counterproductive no matter which camp you prefer."
I don't think enough people that just want the whole thing to succeed. speak up. I'm fine with both BTC and BCH.  I think they can both moon.

"Yeah, though on the SegWit road their cars are moving 5mph while Cash's road are going 80.

Cash's cars will still go 80mph with more cars on the road. SegWit's 1 lane highway will slow down even more while the toll booth keeps raising the prices.

Traffic, how does it work? "
"https://discord.gg/ahSAawG

There should be 1 or 2 cars in the Segwit lane, because nobody uses it.
Innaccurate, Segwit lowers fees not raise them :]
"Why cant BCH and BTC coexist in harmony?

Seems to me that BTC's main value is as a store of value and BCH's main value is as a fast, low-cast p2p payment system. Cant both coexist? If not, why not? Honest question."
Looks about right tbh but you forgot the part where bch closes on the weekends.

"On BCH, every 100km or so, there is a blackhole for 10hours :-)

Unfortunately the Blockstream depiction doesn't represent how the LN operates. That's the problem with artistic attempts to explain technology, often the artist doesn't really understand. It's okay though, I think they explain that away as artistic license.
From which portal are you buying BCH, please?
"So now segwit is an off-chain lane thingy that charges extra fees for some reason? And we're also supposed to believe the tx flux in BCH is higher than the total # of txs in BTC's mempool apparently.

[deleted]
The sad thing about that graphic is I immediately imagined slow drivers from Georgia driving 10 under in the left lane.. even in the awesome Bitcoin Cash highway. Thanks, slow ass Georgia drivers.. -- Floridian
doesnt segwit reduce fee? (e.g. the toll collect doesn't fit?)
The blockstream side should have used less asphalt than BCH though.
There were some drawings calling them 'Block the Stream'.
Well done!
Should be 8 lanes in each. 
"Actually the single lane of tragic paying full price to transact the Segwit lane is discounted.

"This is funny because it reminds me of the argument against wider roads, which is that you increase infrastructure cost and the commute times in a vast majority cases normalize or increase after a few years as more people get on the road. Typical transportation advocates suggest improving public transportation as a much more economic way of scaling.

Find a better analogy for bitcoin."
"Nice drawing. Only the fact is, there's more transactions(cars) going on in the legacy road right now than in your precious cash road. 

Maybe someday perhaps, but not today."
If Blockstream had control over Bitcoin the whole ecosystem would collapse... The whole point this ecosystem exists is so we can have a decentralised currency out of reach for anyone to control.
"This should be their tagline:

""Blockstream: Blocking the stream of commerce for the good of Blockstream."""
Segwit isn't responsible for the toll or congestion though. You should replace Segwit there with Liquid as that's the name of Blockstreams side chains solution.
What toll? You pay less for using segwit, not more!
"if you wanted to make an accurate representation there would be only 1 car on your Bitcoincash highway (highway is private - owner Bitmain)

"It's much easier to play the lower part of this map, with all of that traffic going so slow I can jump between the cars.  The top part is almost anarchic, this game is terrible, I quit blockstream was right ""slow and controlled is easier"" or .. something like that."
But where's the frog?
Was confused for a second because I can't read the word Cash in the top part (colorblind).
What's the mining distribution look like for bitcoin cash?
[A video of Bitcoin Cash widening lanes.](http://i.imgur.com/2RZrwFZ.jpg)
How you draw bcash when miners stop mining and you have ~5 hours blocks? And when you have 1 block/minute and a unplanned high inflation?
Bcash has no cars though. And Bitcoin is not controlled by blockstream nor Core nor anyone else. Stop making fools of yourself and learn something.
"Also, make all green cars the same brand, controlled and created in one single factory, from one guy. 
I'm not against BCH or BTC, but this is just not an accurate representation."
Segwit lane should be showing a discount, not a toll. Not even the metaphor makes sense in this graphic.
"This is not an accurate analogy. It totally ignores segwit's benefits, and implies that you can simply keep adding lanes to the BCH highway without a problem. Eventually the BCH blockchain will be so big it won't be practical to store, let alone download (assuming people actually use BCH). This will absolutely drive centralization.

A better analogy would show segwit as telephone wires running beside the highway, transmitting transaction data faster and more efficiently than the cars.

I still struggle to understand why people continue to attack bitcoin when they're confident bitcoin cash is so much better. Wouldn't it make more sense to work on improving bitcoin cash, rather than trying to shit on bitcoin? Is it because you feel threatened?"
"No, in an accurate representation, there would be about 2 cars in the BCH section.

edit: just did the math and it'd be more like one third of a car. "
Now put dogecoin on the chart
Too many green cars :p
Where do these “tolls” go? Like who receives them? And do the tolls and small block size have to do with Bitcoin’s overvaluation?
Isn't it obvious? They are called Blockstream because they block the stream 😂
"Let's keep it fair
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNuGIlnW0AEYlV0.jpg"
The hype around the USD value of Bitcoin is a double-edged sword and could lead to its downfall, thats what small blockers don't get, if they want a settlement network for hundreds of thousands and millions of value in FIAT/BTC, they are cornering Bitcoin to be controlled by its FIAT value/market and whoever controls the FIAT, the only true hope for crypto is massive widespread adoption, Bitcoin Cash got it better with roomy blocks for usage increase with low fees, unpegging the value of underline token from its FIAT masters back into actual utility and adoption. Monero got it right with virtually unlimited scaling. Sure Bitcoin made many people rich and will continue to do so but it won't change the world with 1mb blocks. 
Remove the road completely IMO. We aren’t paying to maintain the road (larger blockchain)
21 cars, nice. Any more coded message? 
"Great tweet.  

If these sidechains work half as well as promised, we will all *want* to use them because they offer low fees and instant confirmations.  

If the sidechains suck, nobody will use them no matter what the incentive is, because we will just use altcoins that don't have those problems.  

You want me to use your thing?  Build it better than what we have now, don't fuck up what we have now to force me.  "
No 99%. While we have had one or two where users have cleaned up loads of low value inputs that would be pretty expensive to move on BTC as it’d have a much much higher tx size and thus fee than normal. But for the next few years, 8MB full blocks will be a rare occurance, and we can change a configuration file to upgrade as a network to 32mb max no hard fork. So while probability drops long term, it should average out to 99% to get confirmed in the next block for a long time and manny if us hope t9 keep growing blocks if it shows successful and healthy
I'm Welsh so that don't fly!
"Like I said, **you are not USING it**. So stop talking shit. Core's Bitcoin version is simply not usable.

And FYI, you can have bars of gold in safe... which is hard and expensive to move and you can'y buy anything in a shop with it... the way you hodl your BTC is no different. Its useless. Gold actually has use cases in industry and as jewellery, Bitcoin without being used as currency **has no use case any more** which means it can never be just store of value. You are simply delusional."
I'm English. Understatement is what we do. But I'm happy to upgrade from fairly certain to pretty certain.
I wonder if you'd write the same thing before the fork happened.
"My condolences ;)"
BTC value and fee price in USD are uncorrelated when block size is not restricted though 
I use it to store my savings. Is this using it daily, weekly, or monthly? 
Aren't fees paid in btc fraction? Fees are high because btc's value got extremely high. And a lot more people transacting.
It won't affect you directly then but it could have a big effect on the price.
Oh I see. I guess unfairness of fee paid is an argument against it. So is not actually reducing fees all that much.
DAE sense a huge Eternal September effect in certain threads recently? It's like the argument clock rewound to 2012. 
Absolutely. Nothing is guaranteed.
I am not too worried about the USDT thing. I have the private keys to my BTC
What I meant is that grant-meaccess's idea was flawed, in that it implied that divestment in BCH was driving the rise of BTC. That makes no sense as BCH has been rising faster that BTC lately so investment is pouring into BCH and not flowing out of BCH.
Below, and you said that the only anti Segway arguements you heard were limited, so I presented 2 more. I wasn’t specifically referring to censorship resistance but I do see some danger in having ranks of tx
If this is how the Bitcoin community is then I hope you've invested your money and lose big time. Perhaps you already have and that's why you have such a terrible life.
I think if you replace “5 years” with “about 6 months” you might be onto something. 
Okay but what other currency let’s you buy low and sell high? That’s not a store of value. That’s some crazy money printing machine! Not complaining because hey, free money, but if bitcoin will ever be taken seriously, then it should be stable in valuation.
IMO seems like BTC will be more like gold and BCH or something else will be the currency as Satoshi envisioned. 
"$7000 was the value that 1 btc was recently valued at. Because of the nature of bitcoin, what's on the stock market are groups that invest in bitcoin for you, however they often charge high fees for this service, which means that in a dollar equivalent; you are paying a firm $1.40 to buy a dollar for you. 

Bitcoin is valued as a currency rather than as a commodity or firm, so it won't be traded on the stock market, rather it is traded like currency on exchanges. That $7000 amount that OP has mentioned is the amount you would have paid for 1btc at the time."
"I would agree if there wasn’t a contentious HF in the way.

Somehow everybody forgot."
That’s not really a relevant comparison. $25 million of extra buying pressure can - and most likely will - increase the market cap by a lot more than $25 million.
That week yes. Not that day.
So the technology behind bitcoin cash is good enough to be used as trading currency? Let's say bitcoin legacy is gold from the old days, its now used for storing (+ increasing value) and doomed for use due to scaling. Then bitcoin cash is the new digital valuta we should be using to buy/sell stuff?
What about volatility? Do you see the volatility going down? I don't think people would use it for everyday transactions if the coffee you purchased last week ends up costing twice as much today 
No, it's not.  BTC is the reserve currency of the internet.  There is literally no chance of B2X succeeding, because every exchange runs on BTC.  Good luck Garzik.  
That's not what I said at all.
I manage a tattoo shop that accepts bitcoin (and other cryptos)
"At least in the case of Bitcoin it is, because Bitcoin's only primary value -- the values from which others are derived -- is as the premier/better currency (medium of exchange). If Bitcoin cannot be used to transact, it would be worth nothing as soon as people recognized its uselessness. If it becomes less and less useful for transactions, its real, primary value will decline or even vanish (given that it is in competition with many other currencies), and then it will only be a matter of time before people realize they're all locked into a bubble. Its popping could happen at any time.

On the other hand, if Bitcoin continues to be the best medium of exchange, then the secondary (side-effect)  ""store of value"" value will be secure, because everyone can be confident that it will be valued/bought far into the future."
Who accepts bitcoin core?
lmao yeah cause if you aren't a redditor you dont understand the difference or issues at allllll.  Man Reddit is conceited xD
It's just not actually true, though. 0-conf transactions may be reliable if the blocks are reliable, but that just has not been reality. In fact, the only reason why it even pretends to be reliable is that the transaction rate is so low. This is a case where the difference in activity on the networks makes you think Bitcoin Cash is working better when the reality is that it's just not being stressed at all.
Haha. Tether. Sorry.
The big issue here is the control that one company has over the narrative, since they control both of the main bitcoin forums and promote their own self serving view at the expense of free discussion. This is a really unusual situation, especially since the philosophy of Bitcoin is censorship resistance. It's very unlikely the same thing will happen with Bitcoin Cash.
It's got the name, dawg.
"Now that the people who fought the scaling changes core wanted are out, BTC can implement it's developers' goals.

There's a good chance fees will come down."
How is this being upvoted? Did everyone miss the lavish spending during every previous bubble? Newly rich people spend more than anyone.
i agree. fuck ripple. BTC gold. BTC cash for purchases.
"Everything's a bubble. 

Look at the housing market, it crashes every 20-30 years sometimes sooner, then slowly works it's way back up.

BTC is the same, I predict it'll crash massively once it starts passing 10k, as many of the larger holders will start cashing out. Then eventually it'll repeat with rich people buying thousands of bitcoins low, then selling high once the price raises again."
LOL
Be honestly, I didn't expect that Bitcoin hits $7000 so fast. So 10k until the end of this year doesn't seem something unreal XD
">And Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the political issues that Bitcoin has

Yet."
Yeah. But, who knows what happens next run.  I just don’t want to underestimate those “common investors ”. 
If only the price moved in a straight line.
I've been buying stuff with BTC since 2013. I'm just more conservative with my spending of it. Once it is mass adopted the price will be more stable and it won't be moving at the rate it is now.
">Bitcoin Cash has an 8MB blocksize limit currently, compared to Bitcoin's 1MB blocksize limit. 

This is untrue. with segwit BTC limit is 4MB of weight

You will not get a non biased perspective from anyone regarding BCH and BTC . I am biased towards bitcoin so keep that in mind as I explain to you the differences -

**Bitcoin (BTC)** -

99% of developer/specialist support

Far more hashrate - http://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

Larger community of users

99% of merchant support

Far less mining centralization

Far more node decentralization

Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.

Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)

LN wallets we are testing right now -

http://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2017/10/12/test-blitz.html

https://medium.com/@JimmyMow/announcing-zap-a-lightning-network-wallet-47622acd89fb

-----------------------------------------------------


**B Cash (BCH)**

One of 7 altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin

Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security.

Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.

Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9230 which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit

Still has not balanced UTXO costs and no plans to do so.

Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA"
It might surprise you then that Blockstream is funded by AXA.
* crickets *
"That doesn't surprise me, given how often I hear it repeated here. Why does that matter? What leverage does that give them exactly? They've already gotten the funding and traded equity for it; the most leverage they have over any core developers is to threaten to use their board control to fire them and force them to take a different incredibly lucrative software development role in another crypto startup.

This is a non-issue."
"There are two sources of income on the blockchain, block rewards and transaction fees.  Since fees are voluntary (donations), they are an inconsistent source of income, so miners are incentivized to mine as fast as possible for the block reward.  

As a dev on an open source project, you don't get paid for making code, so in order to do so, they had to find a way to get a cut of the transaction fees (miners will refuse to give up block rewards).  How to do this? 

They have to code in an entire new layer of code to provide additional services (LN, sidechains) to users.  But they have the same problem of inconsistent source of income; plus donations are low (b/c average transaction is low -> buy coffee!).  So they refuse to raise the limit of # of transactions possible to develop a fee market (high fees for faster transactions) and then grab a cut of the higher fees by offering a ""discount"" to use their special layer 2 service.  "
"It's an ongoing testnet environment with 2 years of funding.

Not just one test."
Yes, artificial congestion is an example of an attack. It not an implicit function of Segwit. Even without artificial congestion, if people found Lightning Network or other second-layer, fee generating services valuable, that is ok.
You're unnecessarily implicating the lever with the attack. If Lightning was bad on its own merits, you could describe that without resorting to the attack that used it as leverage.
That’s point of failure would be the Sia network then? Now we must relay on that network to be stronger than bitcoin....?
"SegWit is part of the attack, basically a misdirection tactic to stall fixing the damage caused by the attack, but also a move to facilitate the next part of the attack plan, Lightning.

Again, if Lightning was any good, it wouldn't need all that dishonest bullshit to be accepted by the community."
"so store the blockchain on the Sia network

problem solved"
No one said they aren't making good fees today. It's just too premature. Plus, the concern has always been longer term. Blockstream clearly is trying to divert fees to offchain layers so they can profit. There's no contradiction, you idiot. 
I live in Thailand, so crossing the street is really something to fear :D
"People who have been mining for that long of a period of time have earned so much through it that it's beyond their concern. This isn't people who are dumping their Bitcoin for BCH, this is people who are so damn wealthy from Bitcoin that it literally does not matter. Big money can move mountains without breaking a sweat, they can take a tiny portion of their wealth and totally crush anyone who isn't on the same order of magnitude in a given area.


Those are the voices that are making these Bitcoin Cash movements. They aren't people who have anything to lose from it. They are people who are so big that they can use that leverage to say ""We're going all in on this other thing"" and drown out all of the little guys.


It's easy to stop caring about things when you're so loaded with them that they no longer have value to you."
"> Blockstream clearly is trying to divert fees to offchain layers so they can profit. 

As evidenced by the zero off chain transactions they have made money on. Ok bud."
Why would LN fees be basically zero? At a minimum, there is the time-value of the funds involved that would need to be recovered by those participating. Add to that any risks associated with regulation that hubs may fall under due to their role as money transmitters.
Great so I hope they keep testing but this is far from a done deal. It needs to be proven first before you claim victory. 
"The fees generated by artificial congestion were part of that attack; forcing people to waste money and use Bitcoin less are definitely not within the purpose of Bitcoin, as you put it."
Agreed. Equally, claims that it doesn't propagate, etc,  also need proof - and there currently is none as the testing is not completed. So best not to state those kind of claims as fact.
