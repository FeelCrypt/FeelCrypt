"Nice! You have enough for more than 2 beers now. :) Please go back sometime and buy a pint for a yourself and a friend or stranger on us with BCH!

...Now let's see if we have enough chutzpah to get a round for the whole bar ;)"
It‚Äôs worthless crap
"How is that supposed to be funny? 
Each time you make such stupid comment, Bitcoin Cash grows stronger."
"That is a possible scenario yes. Here in the US it should be deductible from any other capital gains passive income you might have, I believe. I left it out as it doesn't pertain to capital gains, which was the poster's fear. 

Cool thing is that you can do tax loss harvesting though. Instead of making purchases with a falling currency, you can just transfer to another currency that's also down and have a capital loss you can carry forward to offset your later capital gain."
Hah! So many dipshits here have sent me BCH. Gonna immediately convert it back to actual bitcoin, lolol.
It‚Äôs worthless crap
It‚Äôs worthless crap
"For the record, I am human and downvoted you and this thread. BCH isn't bitcoin. Bitcoin has a market cap of ~$200 billion. BCH is a joke of an altcoin that some early bitcoin investors are using to manipulate new money in the crypto space to their advantage.

Now downvote me quick to try to hid my dissenting opinion."
Shouldn't you have paid the bar person?
It‚Äôs worthless crap
It‚Äôs worthless crap
"More hash power is not better security.  More proportional distributed hash power does.  Asics cause less distributed power over the nodes, reducing security and making the possibility of 51% attacks much easier.  It's not an unreal possibility for an advanced tech country to manufacture a great deal of powerful asics and bring them online at once with more than 51% of the hash power.

All coins have this weakness.  Any small coin that's POW could be destroyed with a single mining farm being pointed in their direction.  POS is a bit harder, you have to assume that a single actor can get more than 51% of the coin, which could be harder if there's passionate believers in the coin."
That beer is now worth 3x more or less

"I came for the beer, but upvoted because you all just taught me about chaintip. Game changer. ;) Thanks!"
"As we like to say in Australia - That's not a slowdown, **this** is a slowdown!

Bitcoin Core losing [200,000 TXs/day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#3m) over the last 3 months is a slowdown!


"
It‚Äôs worthless crap
Well, what are you waiting for? Go spread the love! u/chaintip
I don't hold Bitcoin cash (but would send you trx (don't laugh) for a start? Sry, learning...
That is not bitcoin. 
are you sure you're not here for some sort of attention or help
Nope :)

"Absolutely. BTC should succeed on its merits of high fees and artificial congestion not on the effectiveness of its censorship and deceit campaign. If you defend BTC, hold BTC, contribute code to BTC, trade BTC,  or are an exchange using BTC as a base pair, you condone the acute censorship and deceit and the harm it causes. 

For the good of all crypto and reputable business practices, it is important that BTC fails. "
It was not light ale beer in that cup. What the fuck is wrong with you
High five! Buying strangers beers with BCH. Gotta love it. You know who would really love this? /u/tothemoonguy
"Best way to get BCH is to earn it! Sell goods and services for BCH and solve both problems at once.

I'll tell you what: Buy something you were going to buy anyway. But buy it with BCH. (Preferably in person). Post proof, ping me, and I'll tip you, just like I did here."

We heard you the ninth time.
Nice trollbot army. Scared much? Jeez these BTC shills are getting increasingly pathetic.
How many user names do you have?
"> More proportional distributed hash power 

You misspelled botnet."
Lol
"I only commented on the downvotes because the upvote count used to be a lot higher and is now down randomly all of a sudden. Bots are a likely explanation.

Anyway, BCH is already the 4th largest crypto by just about any metric after 6 months in existence. (And that's if you count Ripple as a crypto. Arguably it's #3.)

BTC on the other hand, is losing market share fast. Have fun going down with the ship!"
Wonderful! Shoot yourself in the foot and increase our transaction count at the same time. Good luck with your broken centrally-planned token.
"How is that relevant?

Are you saying it's more important that BTC fail than BCH succeeds?"
"You drank Pee. Obvious light ale joke?

Okay, I see you're new to drinking. That's OK"
That would be really great üòÅüëå
Thanks for the info :-)
Yes, everybody smokes there
He was asking about the BitPay Visa Card I believe, not Tippr bot, but thanks...
"For a really good beer in a major city, it's not too crazy. Prices would be similar in BK/NYC for the good stuff. LA too.

Now, you could argue that all major cities are overpriced in everything right now, and you wouldn't be wrong. But it's comparable to other similar places in the world."
How does the payment work?
Well, it's a good thing you didn't buy a cafe-au-lait while in Paris, otherwise the core trolls would be all over this posting as to why Bitcoin was never meant to be used to buy coffee.
Same, I‚Äôd love to use BCH but I have just about no money to put into it

Belgian beer as well. They have pils, witbier and IPA and maybe some other stuff that i'm forgetting. 
Can‚Äôt go out with glass cup, that‚Äôs why
u/chaintip
So amazing and Bitcoin Cash will be the top 1
Same brewery as Duvel, but sweet instead of bitter. Was my favourite beer back when I still drank alcohol... 
Ehh, it was about that time when I came to the conclusion that asic mined coins should die.  Still of the same conclusion. 
 Bitcoin cash is dead tho lol!!!
"Your news of Bitcoin Cash's death is greatly exaggerated. 

The OP bought a beer with Bitcoin Cash. "
Ta gueule connard
"A)  Bitcoin Cash doesn't segregate its witness data and its blockchain includes Satoshi's Genesis block so Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoIn like Bitcoin Core. 

B)  Why would any merchant accept anything other than Bitcoin Cash when it is the only coin designed to be a global currency. 

ed:typo"
No, just Bitcoin cash
Username checks out. The real mistake though, is that you can no longer buy beer with BTC. And that's not going to change anytime soon, if ever.
You're just renting it. :P
Probably that, and to learn how to put crypbit in my block chain
Why does it come in a plastic cup? At 7 euro i would expect a nice chilled thick pint glass with a mini umbrella and a colourful coaster
"That seems pretty silly. You still come out ahead even after capital gains tax. For instance, consider these scenarios:

Scenario 1: You put $7 into your bank account and pay for a $7 beer with a debit card. Ending balance=$0.

Scenario 2: You put $7 into your BCH wallet. It immediately rockets up in dollar value to $17. You now owe 30% in tax on the $10 gain (which is actually unlikely, especially after deductions etc.) You now effectively have $14 to spend. You buy a beer for $7. Ending balance = $10

You still win, even considering capital gains. Change the numbers however you like. It still works."
You pay the beer, the beer sleeps with you, then you go your separate ways.
There is no limit to core supporters dumbness
Both!
The best beer I ever drank!
"We used a Bitcoin.com wallet and I sent him the payment.

You definitely should check it out"
The beer was really happy to receive the bch üòÇ
"Yay for accepting BCH, and i plan to visit. 

but they should be ashamed of serving beer in a plastic cup in a bar. Especially a Belgian pillsner (primus). "
That's silly. The only way any crypto is going to go up in an sustainable fashion is if people actually *use* it. Spend and replace. That way you can have your crypto and use it too.
Yes, beer tastes 3X as good when you buy it with BCH. Afraid of missing out on gains? Simple: Spend and replace.
Bartender uses a mobile wallet (bitcoin.com)
That's great news. I thought all those crypto cards were dead :o.
You just use a BCH wallet. Download one from Bitcoin.com or similar. You're set up and ready to receive in a matter of seconds. That's it! Could it be that simple? Yes it is.
Are there still people in this world that are unaware of Belgian beer? What a shame. Lambic is a dying art in Europe.
I‚Äôm all for adoption but btrash? Meh üòë
Do they accept any other alt coin?
What do you mean go out? Out of the restaurant? 
I see Belgian beer, I upvote
shit, this is expensive
seriously? a plastic cup? 
Did you find it or did it find you?
Sorry the truth hurts üí™üèΩ

What's wrong with really efficient and specialized computers? More hashpower with less energy consumption and harder to hack from the outside. More environmentally friendly and secure against attack, no? 
What did the beer do with the BCH after you paid it? We should probably be more worried about sentient beer. :p
[deleted]
I'll start doing that when the United States adopts crypto as an actual currency. I don't want to have to pay capital gains tax for buying beer. And I'd also need a quick way to exchange usd for crypto. Coinbase takes for fucking ever. And gemini isn't an option in my state :/ It's so frustrating. 
"Yeah pretty much
You start with the BitPay wallet app, either BTC or BCH or both, add their Visa card to the app too, then add funds in USD to the card‚Äôs balance from either a BTC or BCH wallet now, it‚Äôs easy and cool, then swipe your card anywhere Visa is accepted..."
[removed]
And I thought you have some sense of humor >D
"3: I put $7 into BCH. It drops to $5. I purchase a $5 beer with it and I then can claim a loss on the transaction... hmm 

I guess that only works until I've lost a certain amount right? I don't know how much you can claim in capital losses. "
Whoah! Looks like this thread is getting brigaded hard by downvoting bots too. Man, those BTC trolls really are some desperate sore losers at this point.
The person running it will take a percentage. In the UK the ATM's charge around 5-8% on deposits and withdrawals, as it's at a festival I can't imagine there would be many deposits, perhaps a few (people don't know they have cameras on them and assume it's a totally anonymous transaction) but it'd mostly be withdrawals. Is probably being used a lot more than you might think :) 
"Sounds like Germany is not too retarded as well, true :-) 
Does that apply to taxation of surpluses from stock-trading as well? (holding 1 year+ -> 0 tax)"

Yes, there are good things about Denmark and the danish people, but most of the politicians in parliament are incompetent idiots. "
