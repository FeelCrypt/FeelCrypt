"Why wait? If you want to bet on a hardork go and buy BCC.

You don't want to because it is a stupud idea with only some miner but no users behind it? Oh, ok. It seems to me the is a hidden moral to this story, I just can't point it out clearly just yet."
There is a difference between breaking a verbal promise and locking in a BIP and refusing to implement parts of it. Either go through with it or dont signal it. Thats not asking for a lot.
Hey man after the hardfork dm me and i will give you a good price for my coin on the old chain.
"What do you mean by ""governed by fiat""? 

Core developers brought us this far, I don't see why would anyone want to replace them until something proven better emerges? Even then, it will probably be some other blockchain technology, not forked from Bitcoin."
