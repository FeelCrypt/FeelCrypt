Dude, you need to check your eyes. Mining today is less centralized than _2014_. 

If you're talking about the want for _moar nodes_, people need a reason to run one, and no, it's not Lightning. Grow the economy, get more businesses into the space they'll run more nodes. The end. Nothing else will suffice whether you have 100MB, 1MB or 10kb nodes."

What did Bitcoin copy from Bitcoin cash?

Transactions on the LN are very different than those on chain. It is not a way to scale the blockchain.
"Sorry, but this is really basic bitcoin. A ""miner"" is hashing only a few things.

1. Merkle root of tx's
2. timestamp
3. nonce

trying to get block hash below a certain difficultly... you'll see the block hash will have a massive number of leading zeros.

The pool operator will paste the winning nonce + timestamp + merle root on to the transactions that make up the merle tree, and broadcast to the network.

Miners are paid (in a share based model) where if they satisfy a certain difficulty level.

Say the difficulty is 100B.

Say you mine a block with difficulty 10M, even though this isn't a valid block, the pool will give you a ""credit"" and you will get a portion of the next block they find."
How can you do that without a dangerous hard fork? How do you determine consensus?

Here's a thought, if we weren't vilifying anyone with a genuine need for pain meds and if they didn't cost so goddamn much, then people wouldn't turn to heroin or other street drugs...
Some of that was on Silk Road. People tend to have the misconception that Silk Road was just drugs. It was not.

Silk Road wasn't absolutely, 100% bad. There was a sliver of good in it for some people, but you can say that about all sorts of bad stuff. And really, Ulbricht was taking a commission. He took a commission on heroin. That's terrible."

There are no other options and we've been to many different places. But she should just suck it up and learn to live in the agony of a live nerve being mangled?   

Would you like me to remove one of your teeth and pike around in that live nerve and then tell you to just deal? You'd be begging for euthanasia...  "
"**Silk Road (marketplace)**

Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Initially there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction.

No journalist nor law enforcement agencies ever documented those things on Silk Road because they did not exist on Silk Road. A lot of internet ""journalists"" these days tend to repeat other sensationalist nonsense without fact-checking it, and no law enforcement agents involved with the Silk Road case have ever stated that such items were sold on Silk Road either; just go read the court documents. Go on, we'll wait. $100 worth of BCH here for you too when you can link us to the sections of the court documents where it's stated that such listings existed on Silk Road."
You saw it. Everyone saw it. Why can't anyone put together enough evidence with all that documentation?
">Yeah they did, they may have sold, and may have been deleted -- I wasn't an admin.

Who did what? Vendors sold those items on Silk Road? You're still wrong, I'm afraid. Again, as I requested in my previous comment, please provide us all here with a link to the government's prosecution documents (and specifying the location of the text in those documents) which mention listings for pedophila and murder for hire being sold on Silk Road. I'll give you $100 in BCH if you can do so - there's literally a $100 incentive for you to discover the actual facts here!

>How about you just google the search terms and find where journalists have been talking about it.

Are you seriously utilising sensationalised articles by so-called ""journalists"" who conflate ""Silk Road"" with the ""darkweb"" as your source for stating that such things were indeed sold on Silk Road?! That's rather absurd. You'd be far better informed if you read the actual Silk Road court documents; you can use Google to find those too. ;)

Here's a link to my reply to another user explaining *why* such things were not sold on Silk Road, apart from the fact that they were prohibited of course:

Evidence used in a court of law needs very clear lines -- witness testimony, or even screenshots aren't enough to prosecute on in something like this as there are outs, whether that be other admins, corrupt federal agents, and a slew of other things. Drawing conclusions from firsthand observation is definitely different than jumping to conclusions, but courts of law are finicky that way -- and lawyers have a way of using loopholes and bullshit to both prosecute, and defend.

Take this for example: Lets assume that there is a bug discovered in the Bitcoin protocol that will allow 41 million bitcoins be mined instead of 21, and it requires a hard fork to fix. But then the community is divided, because some believe that 41 million is better, so they don't go along with the hard fork, they prefer the 41 million version.
