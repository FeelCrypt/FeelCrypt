r\bitcoin is leaking...
Great plan, galaxy brain.
Yes, dammit if you buy bitcoin you are trying to kill it.  Don't buy bitcoin idiots.
"Ironically, yes, if I was planning to kill or suppress Bitcoin, I would buy a shit load of it to manipulate prices.

I would also get the miners under my boot or on my payroll, and regulate the fuck out of any exchanges until they were my bitch.

Then I would bribe, threaten, jail, or do whatever I feel like to control the development team to make sure it can't grow its userbase as anything more than a speculative investment on 3rd party exchanges, which I now regulate.

Then maybe I would also censor the fuck out of the largest bitcoin forums, dev mailing lists, and spam up twitter to control the narrative, just to make sure no one with more than half a brain and one eye talks about my evil bullshit."
