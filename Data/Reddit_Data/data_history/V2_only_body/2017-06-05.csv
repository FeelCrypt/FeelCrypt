"The ""original"" Bitcoin software didn't mine them, but the fixed limit of 1MB has always been there, from the functional beginning.

Your attempt to conflate the early discussions of the pre-release software that ..  oh..  No, you aren't, are you? You don't even know about that.

I'll wait for you to find the actual reasons why it's been 1MB *from the beginning* before I bother further.
"
"> You don't have to do that. You can continue to use Core ... Just change the 1MB to an 8MB or so.

No I can't. I can't expect EC to maintain that limit, especially when miners are incentivized to create unbounded blocks.

> I expect so as well. This has also been further explained.

Funny how some things Satoshi said you're okay with, but when he said that heterogeneity is bad in node software.. well.. clearly he was wrong about that?

"> 1) Because of the capacity limit, average fees required to make it into a block have gone up what, like 300% or more in the past 6 months? Even more if you factor in the price increases. There is no good justification for this when the block reward is 12.5 BTC and we are sitting at all time high prices per coin.

300% above a tiny cent value due to early block space is still tiny. Right now, a transaction of 225 bytes only costs $2.45 for *immediate* confirmation. Why don't you try sending $100,000 to Luxembourg and let me know how much it costs for you to exchange, then wire that money using *any* normal fiat method? You are complaining that a global consensus system of autonomous monetary currency is .. **too expensive** at $2.45 USD? lolol

The justification is, as you well know, very simple. It is the rapidly reducing subsidy. Obviously. At some point, fees must replace the subsidy. You are arguing for *less* fees for miners, and thus less security for the blockchain.

> 2) The block reward does not need to be entirely replaced by fees for at least the next 7 - 10 years, maybe more especially if the price keeps going up. Why now when the industry is just barely starting to mature?

It's been 7 years already and fee markets and fee handling didn't exist up until recently. Fee signalling doesn't exist. Client-accessible marketplaces mostly don't exist. Your 7-10 years is complete nonsense, pulled directly from your ass. The exponential increase of hashrate itself is all that you need to examine to disprove your imaginary figure.

> 3) A restrictive capacity limit is not necessary whatsoever to allow fees to eventually replace the subsidy. This can and will happen naturally as the network grows. The easiest way to replace the subsidy is to process more transactions. More volume = more BTC earned. Profiting off of volume is literally one of the most basic ideas in business.

This is contradicted by actual studies which show the complete opposite. You are *witnessing* the organic growth of a fee market right now. This *is* the natural outcome of a fee market coming into existence. But we're still only paying $2.45 US to include 225 bytes in a globally-distributed consensus-driven network of nodes, and *you're complaining about it because apparently you have zero interaction with actual banks for amounts larger than a Starbucks purchase.*

> 4) The idea that nobody will bother to pay fees if there is excess capacity makes no sense at all. If that were the case, why have users had no problem paying fees for the past 8 years when blocks weren't full?

Studies say you are lying.

Also, I have nothing financial whatsoever to do with Blockstream, troll.

> You are complaining that a global consensus system of autonomous monetary currency is .. too expensive at $2.45 USD? lolol

A lot of people in the world survive off of less then $1 a day. Most other people live pay cheque to pay cheque. So yeah, way too expensive. Oh wait bitcoin is only for the wealthy that want to move around $100K on the regular... dumbass.

> Obviously. At some point, fees must replace the subsidy. You are arguing for less fees for miners, and thus less security for the blockchain.

Uhh, no, not at all. I'm literally advocating for MORE fees for miners, by way of volume instead of ridiculously expensive transactions. Businesses that sell commodities make money off of volume, not on jacking up the per-unit price as much as possible. Literally economics 101 man.

> It's been 7 years already and fee markets and fee handling didn't exist up until recently. Fee signalling doesn't exist. Client-accessible marketplaces mostly don't exist. Your 7-10 years is complete nonsense, pulled directly from your ass. The exponential increase of hashrate itself is all that you need to examine to disprove your imaginary figure.

The 7 - 10 years or so figure comes directly from that fact that in 2024 (7 years from now if you know how to do math), the block reward subsidy will be at 3.125 BTC. By that time fees per block should be about equal if not more than the subsidy. Right now though such a fee ratio is not needed, especially with the recent price spikes. And yes, fee market has already existed in a lesser form for all of bitcoins history. 

> The exponential increase of hashrate itself is all that you need to examine to disprove your imaginary figure.

Are you seriously denying that somewhere around 2024 the block reward goes down to 3.125? Bitcoin 101 dude, these numbers have literally been known from day 1. 

> This is contradicted by actual studies which show the complete opposite.

Please link to said ""actual studies""

> You are witnessing the organic growth of a fee market right now. This is the natural outcome of a fee market coming into existence.

No, it's what happens when there is an artificial cap on supply of block space in the face of competing demand. This is very well known, even your Blockstream gurus admit this (and they wanted it!).

> But we're still only paying $2.45 US to include 225 bytes in a globally-distributed consensus-driven network of nodes, and you're complaining about it because apparently you have zero interaction with actual banks for amounts larger than a Starbucks purchase.

haha yeah ok then. Sure buddy.

> Studies say you are lying.

Again, link to said studies. Not that it's necessary, you can look at the public blockchain data yourself and see that indeed over the past 8 years, the vast majority of transactions have paid fees, even when there was plenty of excess space. I guess you never heard of the minrelaytxfee setting huh?

> Also, I have nothing financial whatsoever to do with Blockstream, troll.

Where did I claim that? Projection much?

You are straight up ridiculous my friend. See you in another month!

They are not, which is why if they receive the right signals they will fork themselves away from core.

lol @ design parameter installed and written ""in stone"" (Satoshi's words) being ""a bug.""

"Not even sure what you are getting at. 1MB limit wasn't added until mid 2010, that's a fact. Yes it requires a hard fork to get rid of, we already all know that hence the past couple years of debate. Anyone with a brain can see that it was not actually intended to be a permanent piece of the economic model, just a spam limit for the early days. You already know all this though so I don't need to keep repeating myself.

See you in another month!

"
"This the part where I mock you for redefining the immutability of hard fork consensus parameters for one constant but not another. Whether it's MAX_BLOCK_SIZE or MAX_SIZE/2, the result is that now, thanks to Satoshi setting the parameter *in stone* the constants are equivalently hard-fork-required consensus changes.
"
"If it was supposed to be temporary, then why isn't there a clean upgrading functionality in the code instead of a totally hard-fork-required, disruptive constant the way there is for new opcodes?

Satoshi himself described the nature of this code as ""set in stone."" The quote you are relying on to pretend it was a temporary measure has been debunked completely as the opposite.

"> Adherence to the 21M limit is not done ""because the original code is canonical"". It's done because it's a good monetary idea. That reasoning in no way implies that the 1MB blocksize limit should be adhered to. (The limit wasn't even in the original code!)

That's funny, because a blocksize limit is similarly present—and *must* be present—for fees to safely replace the block subsidy.

And you're wrong about a limit not being in the original code. MAX_SIZE/2 was the ""original"" limit. There has always been a limit.

"So why didn't he just put in a hashrate-equals-blocksize like he did for opcode softfork NOPs?

"You can look it up on wikipedia.   DOGE has an infinite money supply.   So transactions will always be cheap by definition of the protocol.   ETH is already getting expensive.   

A good friend of mine stopped working in solidity because his contract costs were hitting $100 per transaction!   Sure it was a complex contract, but basically ETH is getting so pricey it's useless as a contract system.

A contract system cannot have the contract prices tied to a deflationary currency.   To do so is absurd.   Thus both ETH and ETC are absurd.

DOGE is absurd *by design*.   It is intentionally silly, and that keeps the price low and that means it will always be useful for small value transfers."
