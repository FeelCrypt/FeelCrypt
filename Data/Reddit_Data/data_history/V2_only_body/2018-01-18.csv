Which shouldnt be a case for a business account. If they cant accept such large transaction, they should hard cap the limit for the customers. 
The Finance department is currently working on the issue. 
Really, thank you for this :) my first start at crypto 
I actually know someone that made a really good point like you did. They are actually giving all the power BACK to the banks.
the fact thay this got 4 downvotes shows the perils of the reddit voting system.

"You are correct.  The best tools will not see the best gains in a speculative market.  I think they will still be safe bets, even if not the biggest returns.  Most people with skin in the game just want to make money from it and while I do enjoy easy returns in what appears to be the best gambling opportunity of my life time (hard to make bad picks in this market!) I would also be stoked if we just changed the world with useful technology innovations even if there was no money to be made and value was stable.

That being said, nothing will be stable in fiat value unless backed by fiat and therefore centralized, so a roller coaster it will be, and value keeps going up on finite things that have lower emission rates than adoption, and we're still in early adoption times, so market will continue to go up inevitably... and if stable value is out of the question, better up than down, so, so be it!  I think the good tech will be more likely to do well over multiple years though, while shitcoins will come and go.

In the event of another actual bear market (like 2014) I expect a lot of subpar alts to lose a lot of market cap to bitcoin and the good alts that have good tech for their use cases (while everything goes down for a while) but I don't know if such a bear market is going to happen any time soon.

2017 was altcoin boom, with a lot of people reliving early Bitcoin gains (or experiencing them for the first time if they missed out on early Bitcoin days)

2018 I'm hoping will be the year that decentralized exchanges really kick off and go mainstream.  Time will tell.  2018 could also just be a continuation of the alt boom."
Staaaahp
Lowering the interest rate keeps people from hoarding money. 
BCH vs BTC my opinion is that I'm not qualified to have an opinion about the security implications of LN or sidechains, that BCH is more practical right now, and that LN may or may not change that.  I also see conflicts of interest on both sides, but cannot know if either side is actually acting based on those interests or if they're just doing what they think is right.  I'm content letting the market decide and seeing how things pan out.  I'm passionate about privacy tech though because some people actually rely on it and I'd hate to see anyone rely on a false sense of security and have it fail them.
"Exactly..I'm telling you, maybe you might give them some more time, not as an investor, as you are right about the product development needs to fit the responsibility of being in top 15...but as a privacy coin enthusiastic.

That's my whole point. If you call them names and stuff like Ponzi, you give the impression of someone from Bitcoin folk, naming and trying to degrade Bitcoin cash because they fell threatened. I'm not saying you are, but the impression goes a long way as well.

"
"Stealth addresses and Tor is a step forward but verge is not only about that..even a child can tell that they weren't ready for such attention and market cap increase in the nov-dec period. Now everybody expects them to deliver a finished, perfect product, become a leading privacy coin in such short time, kill Monero etc etc? 

Look from another perspective in a larger time frame instead. Do you think you can really say xvg is a Ponzi scheme like bitconnect? You can say they have a long way to go, but calling them a Ponzi is definitely a bit exaggerated FUD and is the exact behaviour of someone feeling threatened imo. If you were a privacy coin guy instead of a Monero one, you wouldn't be so subjective.

"
"I know Tor and the xvg implementation. But yes, you are missing the main point of my argument.
Not offering a complete product or an assuring solution to privacy coin ecosystem is one thing, calling them a Ponzi scheme is another.

I hope you get me this time."
"A snowflake was the term given to social justice warriors, antifa, people who use identity politics, and the PC crowd for being whinny babies, easily triggered, and overall thin skinned folk that can't handle controversy, descending opinions, harsh speech, or really any speech that challenges their world view...... basically a special snowflake that easily melts..... some people say it derived from fight club, to try and paint the insult in a more pleasant light... but the way Tyler used the term was quite the opposite. 

Anyways it's funny when someone butthurt over an elected president is calling someone else a snowflake and supports antifa movements and illegal actions like they did with Ukraine when they supported literal nazis. You are are among brainless hypocrites here. Hopefully it's just downvote bots and not everyone is this fucking dumb."
so are you suggesting that stealth addresses and TOR = good enough, or are you suggesting that Verge has something else?

"All currency needs to have a central agency to prevent the value of the currency to spike. This is usually done by printing more money to get people to spend money rather than hoarding them. This is kinda difficult with crypto currency.  
Also currency needs some sort of backup in case of hyper inflation. Most countries have a large supply of gold, other currencies etc. In order to buy up large quantities of cash. Again, difficult with crypto currency.  
Since there is a limited supply of it, there will always be spikes, people start hoarding until it's starting to turn. Then everyone tries to liquidise their stock and the value crashes. When the pound was introduced in old England, it had the exact same issues.  
My guess this is just a mix of difficult to regulate and baby issues. "
"Again, says the snowflake so triggered they invoke Trump out of nowhere despite all irrelevance to the conversation at hand.

Why are you so angry? 
What gives gold its value? No store accepts gold.
I get what you're saying and my admittedly subjective opinion is that there are a lot of cryptocurrencies created not to innovate but to cash in on growth and I see little reason to believe that Verge is not one of them.  Any crypto that is supposed to be better for a certain use case should have devs telling you why, and the reasons that I see verge promoters citing is that they've done two things that have been done before, while a bunch of others have gone much further.  Maybe they actually want to make it a strong privacy coin and do things that haven't been done yet or improve on things that have been and I'm just not seeing it.
"there are finished products already.

stealth addresses have been in use for years

tor is far older than cryptocurrency, any cryptocurrency can be used with it, and many wallets have had built in support since before Verge existed

this is not subjective opinion, or fud, this is fact.

I hope I'm missing something!"

No clue, and not going to try and find out.
Especially if they aren’t financially educated. I was telling people about Bitconnect and they didn’t know what I meant when I said Ponzi scheme. 
I hope this fucking asshole got the shit rekt out of him. I hope he is completely broke. 
I've never seen the video for this, is it still live?
I do not downvote you, and yes -they had it coming, but have some empathy. They payed for their stupid choice already, do you think it's a human thing to point your finger and call them suckers? Haven't you made any stupid mistake in your life? How would you feel if *after* you made it, some random guy came and mocked you? I am sorry for them. I hope many of them would have learned the lesson.
Here have a Shitcoin Cash tip XD
Yep - and guarantee it’s the same bastards. 
Yes, hello, I'm here for my free money. Where do I swipe my debit card?
i was in bitconnect and ive knows it was a scam for like 3 months now lol. i actually got really happy seeing all the fucktards like myself threatening legal action xD im legitimately in a better mood than i was 2 days ago.
Ghost busters?
Sadly, this is actually a pretty well known psychological mechanism: it is easier to enter denial than accept you have been wrong about something so important the whole time.
"Its basically the common ponzi scheme. I ""Invest"" U$ 100 and I will have a 1% interest per day in an amount of X days ( I heard its about 200 300 days). Its very attractive getting money without doing anything. So people keep re investing and calling other to invest too."
As in every Ponzi, it comes from new people buying in, with no economic purpose to support valuation.
Unless your FedEx
"Its the """"""""Magic"""""""" of ponzi schemes. People get hyped and invest lots of money"
"> 100 BCC --> 500$

You buy 100 bcc for $500? Sounds like a scam."

Kinda hard to take serious though, I mean, Mark Karpeles is still alive, people said the same thing back then.
Is that real lol?
"and there will often be 'true believers' who get scammed again by same scammers. And scammers will target people who've fallen for scams before, they are known marks.  bitconnects victim list, with dox, will be worth a lot.  
who in their right mind would ever give their dox across the web?"
This video shows the mentality of people who get themselves scammed. Even AFTER he has been scammed, he can’t accept the fact that he was scammed.
"Yeah I can feel your sensitivity about the concept from the very beginning, that's probably why you value the quality of privacy coins, and what they actually DO bring to the table. And you're right about that. But Xvg was a 0.003$ coin in October. I feel like they weren't ready to be in the bright spotlight yet mentally and product vise. And we see those after effects  right now. 

I'm not saying that they will surely deliver something, but we should give them time to do so anyways."
Ahh I see now that I'm on a computer lol.
Thanks for your analysis. I agree with you, but I must add that a marketing/name/brand component has also to be considered. To put it simple, think of Betamax vs. VHS video standards: not necessarily the best product gains the market.

Ohhh.
well there was a guy said he lost his house, his car and his wife...
"The saddest part 24 hours later is that the coin that has gained the most (after, obviously, losing over 95% of its value first) is... Bitconnect. 

A Ponzi scheme that has already popped *is gaining in the crypto market*. 

The number 2 gainer is Dentacoin, which has also been claimed to be mostly a scam.

I didn't think crypto was a bubble but I may have to revise my stance."
"Notice the specific collection of hype men/women who come from 3rd World countries. The one from Vietnam even stated in his ""speech"" that his people were poor,""...poorer that you. But we can do it!"" Then notice how there were very few people from richer countries, and the guy from Europe confirmed that fact when he was talking. So, the only conclusion one can make is that Bitconnect was specifically targeting people who were the most poor and desperate above all others. If that makes you feel sick, don't worry, it's because you are mentally healthy to some extent. "

Yeah, monero guy..so your love of privacy coins is the reason why you are almost always in r/monero...try other subs too. It may alter your biased perspective.
"No I pointed my finger and yelled ""scam"" as did many others prior to their downfall. They rebutted with ""fuck off with you FUD!"". So no, no empathy from me. 

If someone told me I was about to make a mistake, and my response was, ""haha fuck you"", and I suffered from that mistake, that is my fault. They can laugh all they'd like."
Jesus, what a shit show
... thank you? Though it appears that I haven't received it yet.
"Monero guy?

let me list you some better privacy coins off the top of my head than verge:

Zcash, zclassic, Zen, Zcoin, PivX, Monero, aeon, Particl, sumo, Komodo, and NAV.  There are undoubtedly more.

I like privacy coins period, am all for competition in the space, and Verge simply does not compete.  It has made two small and rudimentary steps towards privacy but neither of them are new."
Hes just a piece of shit.
"At this moment its not private anymore (but the comments are blocked) go check if you want.

If  ...! It did become very large with a lot of solo miners, but not that large. His prediction of server farms with specialized hardware became reality sooner, which is zero problem. Other than you he never claimed that users with shitty hardware should run a node. 
"Now for what reason you are selectively ignoring the part of the text that said ""**If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes**, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes"" at the same time that you're enforcing another part convenient to you?

">If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we’ll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.

**100.000 NODES!**

He still understands that we need A HUGE AMOUNT of full node to keep all this shit working

"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

"I read the whole post on the link, the olnly problem with it is that it is a [straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) apart from that, nothing wrong
**********
The problem you seem to be blind about is that if core had just raised the block limit to 8MB, the system would stack again exactly how we are now in 1-2 years, when it reaches more than 2.5 millions transactions/day, or 30 tps


Then what? Increase the blocksize again? At the cost of fewer and fewer full nodes and a weak centralized network? We believe this is not worth it, cause, if increase the blocksize is the solution to all scalability problems, we will end up with blocks of 10GB every 10 minutes and a complete useless network (for that)


Increase the blocksize IS NOT the solution for scalability"
There is by far enough information on that post. But I can only encourage you and alikes to stick with the bullshit of the cripple coiners. I don't want them to raise the limit and make 0-conf a useful function again. Wouldn't be good for Bitcoin Cash. 
"> Educate yourself

>- Basically the main problem with RBF is it encourages people to do double-spending - something which is supposed to be totally prohibited in Bitcoin.

>- Full RBF was designed to support sending the same bitcoins multiple times to different recipients

I could, if you provide me TRUE informations, not this (lie) misinformation"
"It seems that you are the one who haven't read them, cause they don't explain how the network will run without people running full nodes

Not mining full nodes, I mean network active full nodes, like the 10k full nodes Bitcoin has"
"You’re ignoring the fact that the miner node would be grossly overburdened if all other nodes directly requested the block from it. So would the internet connection. 

More importantly, how would other nodes know which miner has the new block?  

The miner has to “broadcast” its new block to the rest of the network, and hope that it gets adopted as the next block in the chain."
"Miner has incentive for his node to work fast all the time, his salary depends on it. 

Merchant has incentive for his node to work to check doublespends, but he can wait more than a miner

Non-mining node has nothing to lose, spam the network, delay tx, dont broadcast, just hold a connection...

Miners connect directly for a while now, they have seperate network for fast block trasmission"
"Miners have something to gain by acting dishonestly, but full nodes don’t.  There’s no reason for a full node to “spam” or delay transactions.  They’re not getting paid. 

More to the point, the protocol is resistant to “Byzantine Failures” of the sort you describe. There should be no need to trust either miners or full nodes.

As for miners having their own network, can you post a reference? Presumably this is something set up by a few miners/pools working together? Unless you’re talking about the pools themselves?"
Can't really use BCH unless the exchanges allows BCH trading pairs. Until that happens - BTC will be the main source of wealth accumilation . 
Man, i bought into bitcoin in 2011, sold after mtgox crash and silk road bust. I just got back into crypto this past December after I realized that no, crypto had not died, in fact it was flourishing and perhaps we can still overthrow these shitty banks. It makes me sad to see theres now 1500 coins and a civil war between bitcoin and a bitcoin fork. I get it, but it doesn’t make me any happier that it happened. I wanna live in the alternate universe where they implemented all the changes that make bitcoin cash better, to good ol bitcoin, my first crypto love!

And bitcoin legacy is no-solutions to immediate problems. How can it survive when it’s cheaper and faster to send actual gold? If you think BCH has no right to the bitcoin name, then you reaaaally don’t understand forks or oss. 
"Yes, I claim BCH Is exactly the same as Bitcoin with a higher block size, and I'm asking you to tell me the difference you see, but not only you didn't list a single technical difference but you started to talk about scalability solutions and off chain which are not integral parts of what Bitcoin is.

As far as I'm concerned the fork that changed Bitcoin was the one that introduced Lighting Network support."

You have still not listed any difference. And about your question it really doesn't matter, as nodes mean nothing to the network and mining already requires specialized hardware. But since you want to using the average price of two transactions in BTC now you can purchase enough storage to run a BCH noche por the next couple of years. BTC is useless now, and with 1MB blocks it will be forever, no matter how much you try to push off-chain solutions simply aren't reliable or useful.

At least for xrp, you don't have to open channels lol! If you want fast ""lightning"", we have tipprbot here.

OMG you couldn't pick worse alternative to lightning than premined shitcoin owned by one company. Use Google and in 5 minutes you will find out it the diff between lightning network the open source protokol and lightning labs the company which has obviously a CEO. An you should start believing in toothferies because lightning works. If it didn't nobody would need to be warned that it is still beta version. Same as all Bitcoin is.
Isn’t core just the repository for code??
Or, you know, because BCH is closer to actual bitcoin (by technical definition) whereas the core client has a restricted block size, SegWit & RBF, and has consequently become something altogether different.

Problem lies in malicious entities trying to control Bitcoin for themselves by attempting to centralise the mining, code implementation and leadership by forking off and trying to steal the identity of the original Bitcoin. 
Orders of magnitude cheaper AND orders of magnitude cheaper?!?!  Wow!  I hope they are also orders of magnitude cheaper.
"Also, if you go to two different merchants using different lightning nodes, you have to open separate channels to use on both merchants, causing fees to double.

Also, lightning equipments cannot be hosted by individuals, it has to be centralised by companies.

Also, lightning will require to follow AMLA/FATCA laws in America, so a normal person cannot host lightning nodes and perform KYC for all the people who connect using their nodes.

Btc is basically a centralized coin."

what's going on in this thread?
congrats! more trolls
Do you have a good article to recommend on the differences between the two and the reasons for the fork to a newbie like myself ?
Those losers don't understand that bad publicity doesn't exist! 
Ya. Because people don’t know what they’re signing up for. That’s how shams work. The twitter account is a misrepresenting sham.

How many of those followers are real? 
"**since the Twitter account was purchased by Roger Ver**

ftfy

Make whatever argument you like about why BCH is 'superior' to Bitcoin. The fact is, Roger Ver has an army of Twitter shills at his disposal, and he purchased that Twitter account to shill BCH as the *real* Bitcoin. There are also mounting concerns that he is responsible for clogging BTC & ETH networks with empty transactions just to make them seem slower than Bcash.

If it were truly superior, it would stand on its own merits. It hasn't. With incredibly low adoption, it is already slower than two turtles fucking in the snow in a pool of molasses. Not buying it. Thanks."

"> There is no ""official"" Bitcoin. There are only different versions of Bitcoin that should be judged on their utility.

"Number of followers by itself is meaningless, nobody should gloat over it.

When you read this thread and realize that the tippr bot seems to work better than the lightning network. What a funny feeling
Truth always wins in the end
Why is this in the BTC subreddit and not the BCH sub?
Eh, followers are cheap. Don't be fooled by anybody touting twitter follower count.. it's a mostly useless metric. 
Why is Twitter so filled with bitcoin core trolls? It seems like every post Ver or @bitcoin make have 99% Core trolls in the comments.

I believe in time people will adapt BCH for their daily transaction needs and BTC will become an asset like gold which is hard to move around. If you’re using multiple wallets and need to move stuff around frequently, Bitcoin Cash is one of your best bets.
 
Is this due to the Cobra effect or the Streisand effect I'm confused.

Lol. Considering the account was bought it seems like a good chance the followers are too
I always wondered who runs that twitter account? And grats on getting the push form an official source, hopefully the bitcoin shills can take this as a sign that BCH is as legitimate as bitcoin and has a true potential to overtake it in transaction (that actually go through in a timely manner) volume soon. 
After spending a few days learning about BCH I’m a believer. I kinda knew was crypto was, but in reality I stayed away from it just because I thought it was useless. BCH is what I want crypto to be! I just wanted to say thank you to the community and how great you represent this currency! I think I’m going to buy some next Friday!

If core wanted to change the vision of Bitcoin they should have chosen a new name for their project. People looking for Bitcoin the peer-to-peer electronic cash system are finding Bitcoin Core which is now a settlement system. People are rightly confused and core are to blame for it.
Could you elaborate on exactly how is Bitcoin Cash different from Bitcoin.
"The differences is how each attempts to solve the scalability problem. BTC (i.e. Bitcoin, or Bitcoin Core) attempts to use off-chain scaling methods (like Segwit or Lighting Network), while BCH (i.e. Bitcoin Cash) increased the block size.

In my personal opinion, BCH should also work on off-chain scaling, since stuff like Segwit has several advantages besides just the increase in transaction output. Also in my opinion BTC network is so clogged that's impossible to use, and until they increase block size (which they won't) will continue this way."

If LN becomes as shit as it looks like with huge government regulated hubs then yes, tippr will be objectively better because even though they are both centralized atleast with tippr both parties doesn't have to put up money to receive money and both parties don't have to pay exorbitant on-chain fees to settle and start a channel.

Anytime there’s an obscure yet repetitive inside joke on reddit, assume it’s a meme
"I think it is predatory to sell your relatives on crypto. You have to be honest with them about the volatile nature of crypto-currencies at least if you do. I have let my dad and sister know about my holdings. But I do not pitch it to them. Bitcoin at one point earlier today dropped over 50% from the all-time high while i was sleeping. And the alts pretty much all dropped even further down.

My dad is content with just sticking with mutual funds and my sister is content with just sticking to real estate. The volatility of crypto is too crazy for them to handle. My dad can't understand why I'm not even mad that my blockfolio dropped a shit ton in value. I had paper profits, now my paper profits took a hair cut. Basically it. That profit wasn't even real and it doesn't become real until you sell for cash or goods and services. If I sold my stack, I had no way of knowing what the top was anyways. I could have sold my entire stack too early and then have a difficult time buying back low. Day trading in that way is risky. I day trade but only in a very conservative way where the risk of making the wrong move is very low (but still possible). I'm not gonna get mad over money I didn't actually lose. I've cashed out my initial investment a long time ago. I am hodling because the crypto market could have another bull run one day. Just like how it had another bull run after a 2 year dark age."

Most of the discussion there are about their portfolio gains/losses as if their coins are their most treasured accomplishments. I'm not saying cryptos are not a good investments that will yield to profits, but cryptocurrencies are beyond that.

"Buying cryptocurrency as an investment is legally gray. 

Accepting cryptocurrency for goods/services instead of fiat is explicitly illegal. "
"Can you share what quikwallet does, this is the first I'm hearing of it, or any of the vendors/partners listed on the website. 

Also, while investing in crypto is legally not defined, accepting crypto is lieu of fiat is explicitly illegal. What is your perspective on that?"
I thought crypto currency is an illegal tender in India?

Incorrect.
For now businesses have to try and toe the line. But with critical mass, it'd be impossible to make crypto illegal without some kind of fallback. See: South Korea.
"Awesome! $2.5 u/tippr 

If you don't mind, do you see BCH as complementary to the BharatQR system or a competitor? Not knowing the system I suppose it's complementary and the merchant will never know about BCH, that is, you will never see 5% discount for payments in BCH. "

This is great news for BCH !
So you can now pay for clickfarm services with BCH? Great news!
Yes unfortunately we'll need billions if we have to fight the banking system, so we'll have to build on top of BharatQR. BCH will be converted to INR in real-time for payments similar to crypto cards - oh we'll have a card as well!

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

Have you read the conversation we've been having? Are you off your meds or something? Is this your first day outside of a padded wall safespace? Is the weather getting a little too hot for snowflakes?

If you can't stand the heat, then you better chill the fuck out. 

With each reply you've posted here you're getting more hostile; you are the one escalating the situation, **THIS IS YOUR FAULT**.

I'm sorry to say, but they've lied to you, you're not special, you're just ""*special*"". Women don't need people being assholes in their name; by being such a spoiled brat, you're hurting the fight for equality, you're a living caricature. Go do research, there is a lot of lies spread by SJWs to make  you do their bidding. SJWs don't fight for justice, they don't fight for equality; they say they do, but if you actually study what they do in practice, they're fighting for increased privilege and for the right to oppress those that don't kiss their ass.

You're scared of being on Reddit? I'm scared on being on the fucking planet Earth, where there are idiots like you with significant influence over politics, the justice system, and even the tech and entertainment industries have not escaped the invasion. You're worried your feelings will get hurt online? I'm worried I'll be beaten to death by a lynch mob in the real world just because of what is between my legs.

I don't assault people; what I'm doing here is reacting appropriately in a conversation with a belligerent asshole. You see these groups of symbols on the lightbox in front of your face? These are called written words, they are a way to communicate information. By calling information ""assault"", you're belittling victims of real assault.


It's a funny thing, you guys at the same time worship victims but also do a hell lot to harm them. You wanna know something? I don't believe you guys really care for victims, you just want to use them as shields and  pretend to be victims yourselves to get special treatment.

Btw, did you know there is [a Wikipedia article about you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)?"
"You said ""instant and almost free payments between parties"" and then list use cases that apply to almost no users. The average person reading your post believes that LN will save them from high fees. There are obviously potential uses, but it is not a panacea."
i'm a man and i'm a victim right now of your bullshit which is motivated by your gynophobia so your gynophobia is also harming a man right now but that's not what you meant
Can't find anything, can you?
Dude, are you sure you're not off your meds? Sometimes it looks like you're replying to someone else here...
Well.. of course sending money and losing it while doing it. yours and tippr are completely different things. These are seperate services. Each run by a different single person everyone knows, which don't have to do with the technology. Is that now your argument FOR THE LIGHTNING NETWORK? Please dude.
"*Almost free after you pay a base layer fee and lock your money into a centralized high liquidity hub.

Based on current average fees, Bitcoin requires ~750 subsequent LN transactions to make the initial base layer fee worth it. If you use median fees its about 3000 LN transactions before you break even with just using BCH in the first place.

People like you are the reason that Core was able to change Bitcoin in the first place."
Help for what exactly?
No worse than taking credit cards over the web today.
In the same regard, you could say that you have to monitor the Bitcoin network to see if a there is a published LN transaction that is not the most recent. If you detect this, you would need to outspend the opposing transaction's fee to ensure your transaction gets in the block instead of theirs. But even if your transaction has a higher fee, there is nothing that ensures that the miner chooses your transaction, just as there is nothing that ensures a miner doesn't choose a higher fee double spend transactions. In both cases, you have to trust the miner to have a particular policy and behave a certain way.
In a reliable network, zero conf confirmation is cheap.
I like LN. The mistake by Core was to kill Bitcoin adoption and growth before LN was proven sound, tested and ready for production. 
"Based on our little conversation here, you seem to be the kind of person that causes real world harm (and I don't mean hurting someone's feefees, but actually fucking up people's lives), all the while saying you're doing good. Either due to direct malice, or because you're another victim of their brainwashing.

Either way, the solution is to expose you to the truth. Worse case scenario, you stubbornly refuse to listen, but others will see you for who you really are and will be less likely to join the cult.

Back when I was following things more closely, I didn't realize I wasn't just gonna be learning, but I would need to be teaching people as well; that, together with my lack of organization resulted in me not keeping bookmarks of the thousands of important pieces of information I saw, and I don't have the spare time anymore to browse thru thousands of pages looking for specific links, back then it would take a good part of the day just to keep up with what had been posted since the previous day. But while I don't have links to specific things handy, there's a documentary that has been highly recommended, it's just the tip of the iceberg, but covers quite a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzeakKC6fE (that's the official trailer, with links to purchase/rent it in the description, and I guess you might be able to find it online for free somewhere)"
But you can test in the testnet! Do not put your money in trash, try to know (in testnet)
thanks for this summary
Why does /r/btc even care about LN to begin with?  Why not focus attention on 8MB blocks?  Just sayin'
Yes, although the fix hasn't been deployed yet. I think it's going to go in as part of the next scheduled protocol upgrade.
We might use 2nd layer solutions down the road. 
"The average transaction fee was over 30$ a week ago. I didn't check since then. It is now ~23$.

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html"
Agreed! The tech is cool, but hinging the future of BTC on it is ridiculously stupid.
Probably because most alts are still traded for BTC because there are not as many BCH pairs.
It costs about $6 right now during down times (about once/day overnight) - or about $20 at any time - to send a Segwit Bitcoin transaction and get a first block confirmation. Where are you getting this $30 FUD number? Hard to have an honest conversation/debate when people either purposefully inflate numbers or are intentionally ignorant. 
while you were sucking ver's dick and csw fistfucked your ass
thank you!! :)
You knockabout clown, you.
I'm sure there are some women involved, (at least one for sure).
And that same site has the average BCH fee at something like 50 cents. Is that accurate? Technically yes, but it's incredibly misleading. People and businesses overpay transactions fees allllll the time. BCH can you get transactions confirmed for under a cent, so I don't then tell people it costs $.50 to do a BCH transaction. Same concept for Bitcoin. Just be fair and accurate is all I ask. Stating facts that are blatantly absurd if you don't have context isn't cool.
"If transactions ""fall out"" of the mempool regularly you have to then estimate the future to decide if it's likely that that fee may ""fall out"" and not confirm sometime in the future; allowing the inputs to be replaced by a future fee. Significantly more work is required to make that determination."
"Hey /u/starkbot. The mistake of Blockstream is to prematurely introduce the fee market, killing Bitcoin growth and adoption, and then irresponsibly deflecting responsibility to LN while it is still under active development! 

When LN is ready please consider supporting BCH as well."
"Lol, i thought this was going to be the ultimate solution to BTC's scaling?

Now there seems to be in-fighting regarding LN as well? God help us. "
"We don't need any SJWs involved in Bitcoin, they destroy everything they touch, including their own movements. Women are free to join, but they shouldn't expect any special treatment; they'll be just another member of the community, held accountable for their decisions and actions just like everyone else; if they can't handle being treated like a grown up, let them crawl back into their moldy safe-spaces and the embrace of their self-destructive victim cult.

People's genders shouldn't matter; the fact you're freaking out just because someone said women aren't special, suggests you've been drinking a little bit too much of their koolaid. By being such a hypocritical bigot, you're tainting the image of the very movement that is so precious to you; it's because of assholes like you that people have grown embarrassed of calling themselves ""feminists""."
"one use case is exchange-exchange bi-directional transfers. They will do these 750 transactions in 2 seconds. 

another use case is something like pay per second/minute services like camshows

there are endless scenarios where something like LN makes total sense vs spamming the mainchain (and much much faster and cheaper)

and you refer to me as a reason core changed bitcoin? don't be delusional, asshole. This is a new account but check my history if you want. 

it's not all black and white. Being a ""on-chain"" only maximalists is just as toxic as being a core ""1mb4eva"" maximalist. "
i been in the game since 2010 too so you dont have to tell me. 
ok well you're making me feel personally uncomfortable do you care that you're harming another human being eh
Well said.
i'm of course referring to how crypto is like 95% male
"dude.. 

second layer is great for many use cases like sending money back and forth between entities like exchanges for example. 

WHAT IS NOT OK is to have ONLY layer 2 as a means of transacting. Most people here agree on this. BTC core is fucked because they are making L2 the only way to send pretty much without huge fees. It wont work. 

Yours.org and u/tippr are something like L2 for BCH albeit centralized"
"No. For the following reasons:

[1] Linus Torvalds did not market the distribution to you.
[2] The bug was NOT deliberate and with the intent of causing damage.

However in the case of LN being rushed you have the following:

[1]  The knowledge that LN is not ready.  You have evidence of this via the twitter thread.  Thus you can show *intent*

[2] LN Labs would have committed intent to defraud the public once again have the knowledge that LN is not ready.

The key difference in your strawman and LN is *intent* to market an inferior product that causes harm to the public.

  "
"yea so a merchant has to *monitor* the majority of the mining nodes and detect when the transaction is there. 

Bitpay have proprietary algorithms to do this. A regular full node does not have this capability"
its not about the cost of the transaction that prevents double spending zero-conf accepting merchants
Until a transaction is in a block a double spend is always possible. Someone can broadcast a transaction with a given fee to the network and then send a transaction spending the same outputs to a different address directly to miners so the rest of the network doesn't know about it until the next block is mined. It may not be happening a lot now, but profit maximizing miners can decide to assist double spends in this manner at any moment. 
"For the revocation transaction, you actually have a lot more time to get your transaction confirmed. The contract is set up so that if the other peer pushes an old channel state, he has to wait for the time lock to expire before he can claim the channel funds. But you can access them immediately, and you can use his channel funds to pay for the transaction fees. This will get you confirmed quickly, assuming that your channel was opened with funding greater than N-times the current next block fee.

I guess one thing to note is that if the peer received ""stuff"" in exchange for payment, then the max fee you can set before losing money is equivalent to the (initial channel funding sats - total sats paid by peer in). One way to mitigate this would be to reject payments for stuff if the max fee exceeds some multiple of the next block confirm fee.

As far as the miner not including your revocation transaction, this would be unlikely to me since you'd be putting such a high fee on the transaction. The miners would have to collude, since if one doesn't pick up your tx, then another one should."
