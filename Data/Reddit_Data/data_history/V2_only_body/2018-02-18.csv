"You may have misunderstood what i was getting at. It's really not that far-fetched of a conspiracy.


A basic idea of these payment channels would be payment processors. Your credit card is your account. You pay the vendor via their terminal or online payment gateway.

CC company forwards said money to the merchant. CC takes their cut along the way.


So Payment channels.... and here we are again."
"Dont try to move the goalposts. You were defending a statement about *blockstream* accounts. If you want to equate opening a channel with opening an account with a CC company, be my guest, just dont forget you control your own funds at all times, which is completely unlike CC, where you trust 3rd parties.

Now, tell me about these blockstream accounts."

"No, it does much more than that. It criticizes people for genuinely recommending or discussing products they like. From the about page:

""/r/HailCorporate is to document times when people act as unwitting advertisers for a product [example A] as well as to document what appear to legitimate adverts via native advertising.""

They are straight up criticizing people for discussing interesting stories about products they like, and for recommending inventions that have genuinely enriched their lives.

Is there potentially undercover paid marketing happening in anonymous forums? Sure. That is a tradeoff of anonymous forums, so reader beware.

But even given that reality, a poster's activities can be paid for out of profits and still be considered useful or interesting by the end reader.

I prefer paid marketing efforts to be identified as such, and to know who is doing the typing. But I can't criticize the content on that basis alone.

Roger Ver, for instance, stands to benefit as BCH grows market share. But BCH supporters are correct to point out that this fact does not negate any of his points or observations.

Similarly, people who make a living helping promote a brand may very much raise interesting or worthwhile points in reference to that brand.

"Sorry, but you are wrong:

> the private key is not always online.

**Yes it is.** When you send money via LN you need to sign new transactions for your 2-by-2 multsig onchain address. No access to your private key, no signatures.

> The money is not locked to that channel, it can go on any channel. [It is available for on chain transactions]

Yes it is locked and no, it can't go to any other channel and it is **not available** for on-chain transactions.
The funds are locked up in a 2-by-2 multisig onchain.

It can only be transferred between the two parties (on-chain or via LN) as a direct payment or routed payment for third parties.
The only way that funds can leave that channel is by closing the channel and settling on-chain.

You are probably confusing basic LN operations with the LN-clients **autopilot**-feature that will maintain channels for you. This doesn't change the basics of how LN works though."
Which Rick's point are you debunking, if any?
Cool story bruv. Can you show me how to get a cold storage wallet for LN?
It isn’t called “Rick is thoughtful.” He just reacts.
So there Is still a risk of using it what if the channel I open with is compromised? 
"> Unproven technology. Unproven that it can scale. Unproven that it won't evolve into a hub and spoke model with high centralization. Unproven that regular(coinbase) users actually care about the LN(hint hint they don't).

"You do understand that routing payments for third parties can rebalance your channel?

> I don't think LN proponents see the net receiver perspective

Probably because the ""net receiver perspective"" is less restricted if you route payments.

Edit, example:

**Z <-> ... <-> You <-> Merchant <-> ... <-> Y**

You continue to pay to the merchant until your channel is exhausted/unbalanced. You now cannot pay the merchant anymore (unless you happen to have another route to them).

Y now pays to Z and the payment is being routed via the merchant and you.

Your channel with the merchant is thus rebalanced and you can start paying the merchant again."

"> you lock up your funds for a specific merchant. You can not use these funds for anything else

**This is blatantly false.**

You can use your funds to pay anyone that your merchant has a route to (including yourself)."
"> In this case, you lock up your funds for a specific merchant.

No you don't at all. Your wallet has 5$ still in it, this can be spent with anyone. 

You load your wallet, and then open and close channels as and when needed. 

If you don't need to open a channel (as a route exists) then you just spend what money you have in your wallet.  "
"I'm not talking about gmail. There are other providers

"No I'm arguing that the market chooses simplicity and cost of use when there are multiple options out there, i.e. look at VHS vs betamax. If it's btc (without LN) vs bch, bch wins. If it is LN vs bch, bch also wins, since it is the simpler solution, and already is dominating 14% of btcs market. 

You want some real problems, how about the fact that this super complex system will introduce a plethora of bugs that will lose people money, and the fact that it's extremely complex will slow adoption into pre-existing wallets to a halt. When coinbase implements it you have won, my strong hypothesis is that they never will, and thus other coins will take the lead."
Again, the private key is not always online. A hash of the private key is, and it's a one way has function that is only shared with those you have opened a channel with. 
You would then have to show how it is biased.

Bcash is garbage bcash is a malicious alt coin tryung to steal bitcoin name by blatant fraud and spreading of lies. 
You don't have to keep ALL the funds in the channel before you close it. I am not saying there are no risks but Rick's comparative knowledge of the space would fit under one of Andreas' toenails.
I wouldn't be opposed to implement LN on Bitcoin Cash for narrow and niche use cases although I am very likely never gonna use it myself.
Why does it have to do with Bitcoin cash?
You do know the private key kept in the network is a one way hash of the actual private key don't you? 
"I'm an investor, I focus on what I believe will have the largest market cap long term, which deals heavily with the end user experience. The technicals to me don't bother me so much as long as they are not subtracting from the user experience (which LN seems like it will do)

There are other projects that interest me more technically as well."
This is a complain you see a lot on the test net.
"Exactly. 

LN is not even ""officially"" released on mainnet and can't be as mature as Bitcoin is at this point. It has (known) drawbacks but also a lot of potential.

Let's focus on the trade-offs between the advantages and the drawbacks."
"I agree that central hubs will provide liquidity. But they won't do it *for free*. A bank doesn't lend you money for free.

And they can't manage the risk by just taking a cut of transactions. Because then, they could suffer from liquidity attacks by people opening channels that are not used.

Somebody have to pay for the credit risk of the $5000 USD in my example. "
I can't believe btc fans are now *asking* for **centralisation**
"> That is why it needs central hubs to provide this liquidity.

and you think this is a good idea?"
who is downvoting the truth here eh? 
"> bitcoin

No it isn't... it's called Bitcoin Cash."
You do understand that channels must be funded and become exhausted? I don't think LN proponents see the net receiver perspective. Only the spender perspective (where you provide liquidity for free).
Btw email is a terrible comparison. Do you have to insure your email server? No. Do you have to comply with money laundering law with email? No. Its just not a good analogy for Bitcoin.
No, but email is not censorship proof, private or decentralized. One would assume these are important qualities of money. 
Email was adopted because of online email clients. That is the point. If online email clients were illegal or not safe would everyone be using them?
"Lets make this simple. Regulators don't suddenly start to regulate certain crypto transactions because they can interpret their own rules in such a way that they can argue that maybe LN tx falls under this definition. It doesn't work like that.

If regulators see a need to regulate they regulate. Either they use old regulation they can apply, or they create new, but in any case *they need to see a need to regulate*. If they see a need to regulate they will simply regulate. Its not like suddenly a system of hashed timelock contracts with some clever protocol design on top changes their view of crypto and they go HAH! Now your in OUR domain! Its simply an idiotic notion.

Sure, they can make it illegal to run a LN node if they want to. But they could just as easily make it illegal to run a normal node. That doesnt mean that

1. they want to
2. they can enforce it"
IOTA requires parties to be online validating transactions in order to stand a chance at getting future issued transactions confirmed. Nodes will require incentive, which may come in the form of transaction fees.
"> I disagree with you for one as a user I don't want to have my wallet online 24/7 because the best security is not being online at all. My wallet is offline most of the time. Also I don't leave my phone online 24/7 either. On chain transactions can still occur even if I'm an offline. I can obtain my receipts when I choose to come online.

You don't need to be online 24/7, you need to be online when the other party is trying to send you money. But of course it is a new constraint, but one that allows a massive amount of secure transactions per second.

> As a merchant, I'm planning to market items accepting Bitcoin Cash, I can choose to use a third party, Bitpay, or directly accept payment via my address.

You can still do that.

> Also I don't want to tie up my funds in a LN node requiring 2 on chain transactions especially incurring BTC's high fees.

This is what people said about Bitcoin as well and it turns out that it's a matter of adoption. Once enough people participate in LN you won't think it's ""tied up"".
 
> 2) If LN doesn't solve routing then there is absolutely no need to use LN.

As long as LN is able to find one practical route to the destination, I am fine with it. Doesn't need to be solved perfectly for all edge cases.
 
> 3) The correct answer is True. There is a liability therefore your answer is deceptive.

Where is the liability? You never lose control of your own money. Nobody else can lose your money.

> 3) LN weakens security because LN will open the door to a bank run because there is not enough space on the blockchain for the miners to settle the LN transactions.

A crypto bank-run would cause the same problems with or without LN. The only option to prevent it would be unlimited block space, which has its own set of problems.

> LN is a white elephant and is useless as a technology because it fails to satisfy the Bitcoin use case. The LN may be intellectually stimulating to the developers but it is useless to users.

Practically unlimited amount of secure transactions per second is the holy grail of crypto-use cases.
"
"> There are so many problems

Such as?

> not to mention the main problem of adoption. It's a pain for people to switch platforms, using the LN is asking for users to use an entirely different system. If you think adoption of segwit was bad, wait for the DoA adoption of the LN.

Arguing that a technology is not useful because it is currently not or to difficult to be used was the default argument of people hating on Bitcoin and crypto in general. We saw how that turned out."
Bitcoin has been working for 9 years, we've barely witnessed what the lightning network can do.
BCH hasn't changed in its relative worth to bitcoin though. So i don't know why people presume its going to take over. Trends to date suggest otherwise.
Because it's then biased towards favouring BCH.
"In this case, you lock up your funds for a specific merchant. You can not use these funds for anything else, as they are locked up. That's the credit risk.

But your example is very unrealistic. Do you expect to open individual channels to all the merchants you use? And divide and lock up your funds in different channels?"
"such a system would work better on a coin that has low fees and no congestion. but then that begs the question: if a coin has low fees and no congestion, why would you need a ""lightning Network""?"

"> No I'm arguing that the market chooses simplicity and cost of use when there are multiple options out there

I actually don't see much differences on the UI side. Scan the QR code, press pay, done. But with LN you don't have to worry about double spends.

> how about the fact that this super complex system will introduce a plethora of bugs that will lose people money, and the fact that it's extremely complex will slow adoption into pre-existing wallets to a halt.

Again, you sound like those people that fear Bitcoin. Why are you so afraid of new technology? If there are bugs, people will earn money by exposing them. The network and the potential rewards will grow over time. Just like it was/is with Bitcoin."
"
>No, you load your wallet. The LN address associated with your wallet holds the funds.

Lol believe what you want 
"Sorry, to me it is not clear what you mean by ""private key kept in the network"", and why it would be relevant to the discussion."
"> Your LN wallet has access to your private key,

No it doesn't. Your LN is seperate from your normal wallet. It has its own private key (that you have and own) and it offers one way hashes of your private key to other nodes, so they can route payments through your node as and when needed. "
"Being late is huge!! There are so many cryptos that are better than btc, bch, even eth, first mover advantage is massive, and LN has failed miserably at this point, it's not even production ready when the competition is already in coinbase! 

The myriad of reasons for the LN not becoming widely adopted are enormous. The only value proposition the LN altcoin has is that you can transfer btc into it, very weak if you ask me."

There is an will be no central lightning hub, and **that** is the FUD.

"Because the narrative here is that you lock funds to your channel. You dont. Funds are loaded into your wallet, and you open channels when you need to send funds to someone (if a route doesn't already exist). 

How do ye all not get this. It is so simple? "
"> 1) Routing unsolved. True, this must not be mathematically solved, but it hasn't been solved practically either just as shown in the video with the Russian telecom. If the Russian telecom went rogue, I'm sure there are plenty of malicious 3rd parties out there willing to invest to set up a hub only to have it wipe out funds.

**You are exchanging verifiable, cryptographically signed, valid transactions.** Please explain how this hub could wipe out funds.

> 2) You must look up the definition of custodian, from the moment you deposit the money (t1) to the moment you decide to use or withdraw them (t2), your money was under their custody. So yes, KYC/AML will kick in here just like they regulate all centralised payment processors today.

**There is no custodian because you don't give up control over your money.**

> 3) LN relies on a mesh network, and all mesh networks seen to this day have irreparable security flaws. Of course, LN can be the first big exception, but until I see proof I wouldn't count on it. And you can be dead sure that I don't want my money in a system that is bait for attackers.

People said the same about Bitcoin. **Turns out, you don't need to trust the nodes as long as everybody can independently verify that the signatures are valid.**"
You need to go read up on LN again. You have a lot of misconceptions about it.
[deleted]
"> If I open a channel each time I want to send money then I must do at a minimum one on chain tx per payment -- no better than the current system.

Yes, this is true, but the whole idea is that you won't need to open a channel every time you want to pay someone, because a route will exist.

> If I open a channel with more balance than needed (anticipating future payments) then I have locked up these funds.

No, you load your wallet. The LN address associated with your wallet holds the funds. The channel is opened, and you route payments over it. The channel stays open, so money can be routed over it when needed. The money is not locked to that channel, it can go on any channel, on any route. "
"> And if you do need to open a channel, then you commit, or lock up, funds to that channel.

No, this is not how it works. The money gets send to their wallet. The channel stays open, and money can get routed through it, in both directions if and when needed. The money can also get routed elsewhere. "
"There is a difference between when bitcoin started and now, there is competition, and bch has the headstart vs the LN, you must be a fool to not even consider that it might pull ahead of btc entirely.

I'm a realist when it comes to new technology, when on-chain fees of btc start going to $20-$80 again, you can be sure people will start jumping ship more."
"> Again, you sound like those people that fear Bitcoin.

"Rick states that the private key is kept online. It's not, it's a one way hash of the private key (so other nodes can pay through your node and sign a transaction), but they cant steal your funds, as they have a hash of the key, not the actual key. 

That is how I understand it works anyway.  "
"ooh, OK, I now see where the misunderstanding is.

I'm pretty sure Rick meant ""online"" in the ""hot wallet"" sense, not ""public ledger"" sense. 

Your LN wallet has access to your private key, obviously. Your LN wallet is also always online (or, at least, online for significant periods of time). When somebody hacks your PC/phone, they can get to your private keys.

This is contrasted with ""cold wallets"", ""offline"" and ""air gapped machines"", where it is a lot harder for the attacker to sneak in their attack code to the target machine (but not impossible, check out stuxnet for an impressive example)"
"> There is a difference between when bitcoin started and now, there is competition, and bch has the headstart vs the LN, you must be a fool to not even consider that it might pull ahead of btc entirely.

Let's stay focussed on the ""technological flaws"" of LN. ""Being late"" is not one."
Yup, the experience is very similar to just shapeshifting your BTC into something else, except the something else actually will work, and is completely on a different chain. Sidechains, free-market style.
"It's different, unless you assume customers have direct channels to merchants. But that's called payment channels, not LN.

The hub closest to the merchant must lock up BTC in advance in the channel to the merchant. Settlements can be done every day (lots of on chain fees), every month or every year (huge and expensive risk locking one year of turnover in a channel). 

LN introduces credit risk. And it's not free."
"> How will you achieve this without others ~~hubs~~ locking up [a total of] $5000 USD worth of BTC [across all] channels ~~a channel~~ to you?

FTFY. And you don't."
regurgitating buzzwords tells me that you have no idea how any of this works...
If LN being late is your only complaint then it seems like I have more issues with LN than you do.
You will understand the problem if you try to be a merchant who is actually making money and want to settle your profits on chain.
"> Decentralized immutable censorship resistant

Those are Bitcoin properties. You don't need LN for any of those."
You aren’t allowed to cast shade on the LN or BTCore on /r/bitcoin. They aggressively censor dissent/FUD.
"I gave you way more issues than it just being late. They all add up.

If you need me to summarize them again:
Unproven technology.
Unproven that it can scale.
Unproven that it won't evolve into a hub and spoke model with high centralization.
Unproven that regular(coinbase) users actually care about the LN(hint hint they don't).

Point is, there are tons of uncertainties (you must at least admit this in some regards) and that is an extremely reckless decision to be the only path going forward on a multiple billion dollar network."
I said exactly what i meant above. 
[removed]
Just as you are?
"> That money is not available for on chain transactions. If I need to pay to someone who does not accept LN payments (or a route cannot be found), then I cannot do that.

Again, not true. A LN wallet will be able to pay to both LN wallets and normal wallets. They can even determine which is which from the address (as the wallets have different formats). 

[Here is a good video, by AA that clears up a lot](https://youtu.be/c4TjfaLgzj4). It is only 20 mins, but worth a watch. "
"It's because astroturfing faked discussions on r/bitcoin combined with censorship is just that effective at dictating opinion.

When people feel they belong somewhere they often put down their guard with their critical thinking and tend to follow along with the group opinion. With group opinion in this case being completely fabricated through astroturfing with fake accounts."
Not in the slightest. Just statists: whatever benefits them at the moment. No principles
Calling a central lightning hub centralization is FUD and baseless?
And if you do need to open a channel, then you commit, or lock up, funds to that channel. The other party still also have to commit funds to it, and will probably demand a fee for this.
thank you
yes
Yeah he’s not supporting it just pointing out how it works. Put your pitchforks down.
"wtf is your problem?  I support big blocks and dont own any btc. 

That doesn't mean you need to stay ignorant on how LN supposedly works. 

It's cool tech but I think it is stupid to bet the farm on it. 

besides what i wrote does imply centralization so thats a bad thing!
"
I don't think you understand LN at all. Maybe go read up on it again?!?!?
I'll take that as a no.
I'm really struggling with this. Surely I'm missing something. There's no way the lightening network is as retarded as it seems at first and second glance. There must be more to it, there just has to be.
Agreed.
So LN has its own private key that you deposit bitcoin in that is still always online still a risk
"You don't understand LN! You don't lock any funds.  You load your wallet and send money along channels. The channels stay open so that money can flow through them as and when needed. 

How can you all not get this? "
"Let's assume you are a merchant, and you want to settle once a month on chain. You expect $5000 USD turnover per month through LN (though, you can never know this number for sure.)

How will you achieve this without other hubs locking up $5000 USD worth of BTC in a channel to you? (And no, multiple channels don't change anything, they just spread the risk but increase on chain fees.)"
I believe you misunderstood what I wrote. A big hub will not lock up funds to anybody in the receiving end for free and just charge by the transaction. Because it's a risk that the channel will not be used/exhausted.
[removed]
"If I open a channel each time I want to send money then I must do at a minimum one on chain tx per payment -- no better than the current system.

If I open a channel with more balance than needed (anticipating future payments) then I have locked up these funds. They are not available for other on chain transactions, e.g. for funding additional channels.

2) If LN doesn't solve routing then there is absolutely no need to use LN.   You might as well do your transaction on chain and it is peer-to-peer.  Bitcoin Cash guarantees that your transaction will be in the next block and it fast, reliable and cheap.

3) The correct answer is True. There is a liability therefore your answer is deceptive. The hubs provides a temporary loan by forwarding its money to the recipient.  The hub then clears the loan with the sender funds and charges the sender a fee for the use of its money.  Because the hubs is now in the business of monetary exchange it comes under the purview of banking regulations and legal liability.

3) LN weakens security because LN will open the door to a bank run because there is not enough space on the blockchain for the miners to settle the LN transactions.  Hubs will compete to have their transactions cleared thus raising the price of on chain transaction to such a level that individuals can only afford to do LN transaction and only through a hub large enough that they can afford the on chain fee to have their transaction cleared.

LN is a white elephant and is useless as a technology because it fails to satisfy the Bitcoin use case.  The LN may be intellectually stimulating to the developers but it is useless to users."
Major problems are not minor details. :)
"Andreas and all these people who talk about Lightning Network always assume that every person who will use it is a software engineer or some other software geek. People want convenience which means online wallets managed by companies such as Coinbase.

Andreas admits that exchanges won't run lightning wallets because KYC laws. That means that people will have to run them locally. That to me seems like a disaster for adoption."

People are already doing that! Transactions are less than they were 2 years ago. Good job core! /s
"> I'm not sure I get the claimed custodial aspect of LN. Extending the logic used here, when you open that channel with somebody, they are just as much opening that channel with you. Why then is only one party the custodian? I don't feel like this claim holds up, but of course, that could stem from a misunderstanding.

I am making the assumption that for the most part, one party will be providing an ""open a channel with me"" service. Regardless of who chooses to open and who chooses to accept, there will always be an offer-accept sequence, even between friends.

Since people who use this service need to deposit funds into the opened channel, regulators will regard this as falling under custodian-of-funds regulation.

Do use email in 1985 you had to have system engineer skills. Is it still hard to use email ?
I have been waiting for this episode since Rick announced it in his last video. Looking forward to it!
Awesome video. Rick, you should also post this video on Dtube, Steemit and Yours.org.
"> If a merchant wants to receive money on LN, he must convince a node to lock up money even before he has done a sale. 

This is completely false. 

If you are a merchant. And I am the buyer. I open a channel to you for let's say 10$. I buy something for 5$. That 5$ goes over the channel to you. You give me the product. We both have 5$. We leave the channel open, as we may trade again, or we may use the channel as an intermediary. 

Where is the credit here? "
"Thanks for the great video, Rick. I have another showstopper for you:

LN introduces credit.

If a merchant wants to receive money on LN, he must convince a node to lock up money even before he has done a sale.

First, the merchant must guess his turnover. Let's say $5000 USD the next month.

Then he must convince a node to lock up $5000 USD worth of money in a channel to him.

This is almost like a loan. The merchant will have to pay the interest on this frozen capital. Even if he doesn't get a single sale.

On top of that, you have the fact that a merchant must buy/get BTC before setting up the channel, and all the on-chain fees.

This is such a horrible deal for a merchant. They will never choose this expensive and risky mess over BCH.﻿"
That is why it needs central hubs to provide this liquidity. The merchant won't need to do what you said necessarily. 
Yes, you start by opening a channel, which is done with an on chain tx and costs money.
Honestly segwit with batched sounded more promising than LN even despite its huge flaws. Now people are betting their livelihoods on this LN scam. Unbelievable. 
Sounds a bit like IOTA as well?
"> the routing problem doesn't require just any route, like the internet, but a route with sufficient liquidity for your transaction. The larger the value, the less likely it is to find a route. 

This plus the fact that routing patterns change after each payment (because channels might become unbalanced in the desired direction) is one of the actual valid concerns that apply specifically to LN.

Talking about lack of adoption, IRC being insecure and that you need KYC/AML even though nobody risks losing money just distracts from LNs inherent problems."
"Very good point!

And yes, I totally enjoy hanging out randomly. I live very centrally in Berlin."
Thanks for the kind words! <3
"You know that not only the Devs of the ""BTC fork of bitcoin"", but many others are working on Lightning implementations?

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-isnt-crypto-adding-lightning-tech-now/

They must be all wrong..."
but what does this have to do with bitcoin cash?
Lol wait until bcash i mean roger or jihan decide to add lightning network and see how fast you bcash people all of a sudden love lightning network.

Question, does he support BCH? Because if he does, his opinions have to be taken with a bit of salt.
"**Must  be online to receive**

True, but it's not a showstopper. Merchants who would tend to lose business during a connection outage probably also wouldn't risk maintaining their own Bitcoin node and would pay a third-party anyway for that service (BitPay, ...). If you receive money as a private person you probably are going to have a LN wallet on your phone which is regularly online to receive a transaction eventually.


**Routing is unsolved**

True, but not a showstopper. Routing does not need to be solved in the mathematical sense as long as it is good enough for the LN use case.


**Legal liability for nodes**

False. You don't deposit money with a custodian. The other party does not control your funds, you do. If you want to take your money out, the other party can't prevent it. If regulators want to regulate multisig and smart contracts, then preventing LN won't stop them.
 
**Reactive security**

> IRC is a mesh network. IRC has bad security. LN is a mesh network. Therefore LN has bad security.

False. Instead of a logical fallacy, how about describing an actual attack?"

Thanks, I plan to!
"There are so many problems, not to mention the main problem of adoption. It's a pain for people to switch platforms, using the LN is asking for users to use an entirely different system. If you think adoption of segwit was bad, wait for the DoA adoption of the LN. 

Moreover, since the btc fork made their so called solutions optional, many services never have to implement the LN or segwit, and just promote bch instead. You're dealing with a losing system."
">If a merchant wants to receive money on LN, he must convince a node to lock up money even before he has done a sale.

That's not true. The merchant can open LN channels and route payments, which will move funds from one channel to another. Then the merchant can accept payment on the unbalanced channel. As they pay their suppliers or send to an exchange via LN, it will create additional capacity for them to receive on their channels.

> Then he must convince a node to lock up $5000 USD worth of money in a channel to him.
> 
> This is almost like a loan. 

Except it's entirely *unlike* a loan, since the merchant has no legal or physical ownership of the funds.

>On top of that, you have the fact that a merchant must buy/get BTC before setting up the channel

No, channels can be unilaterally funded. Like for instance when you create an account with a payment processor..."
"
Is it true that with LN, I need money before I can get paid money ?"
Oh I love it Routing is insecure ... Explain tor you douche.  
Well said.
There is another showstopper. Big node hacked. 1MB(well 2,3MB or something like that with SegWit) chain will not be able to close channels in time...
Awesome vid, keep em comin 
Why? 
Most people support BCH because of lightning/core. 
"It's actually much worse than he says, the routing problem doesn't require just *any* route, like the internet, but a route with sufficient liquidity for your transaction. The larger the value, the less likely it is to find a route. Furthermore, imagine you open a channel with your buddy, but he's offline when you'd like to pay the coffeeshop he in turn has a channel open with. Congratulations, you're SOL! Especially SOL'd if an on-chain TX fee is high enough to justify lightening in the first place.

TL;DR the lightening hype is the stupidest shit I've ever heard and is what drove me to bitcoin cash.

P.s. Rick, I don't live too far off. Do you ever hang out with normies like me? Meetups or what not? Stammtisch?"
