That's a quarter million dollars! You should make a police report, not sure if that helps.
Crypto isn't anti-government, it's just decentralized
This isn't about crypto it's about an exchange
You know Blizzard couldn't even get China to shut down the illegal World of Warcraft theme park.
that is some big time bullshit okcoin are trying to pull on you, hope you throw the book at them, literally
What business is it of yours? Do you really think that anyone with more money than you must be up to no good? 
i bought bitcoin 5 years ago and never sold much.
Yeah, this is the risk you run when investing in a unsecured currency backed by no legislative body

no, only okcoin and me had access.
You thought wrong dinkus.
Yeah your post got deleted. What did it say?
They really are the worst of the major exchanges. I don't think they are stealing OP's money, but their entire company is plagued by general incompetence and dishonesty.
These funds are locked up for months now due to the PBOC lockdown.  They were worth just a fraction of it  when I deposited them.
Indeed
I just made two comments saying the same thing.  
I haven't heard this rumor. Have people been saying this lately?
"> I think the rumors are right. The chinese govt is covertly confiscating bitcoins.

*They did the math.*"
This sounds the most logical. No dragons or dinosaurs, but the logic fits. 
"From their persepctive he looks like a chinese citizen who is now trying to say ""nah, I'm totally this european dude."""
hope so.  97 bitcoins isn't worth destroying reputation of major business.  
"To me, it looks like someone has hijacked OP's account and was able to successfully social engineer the support into changing the name on the account.

Now, why that hijacker wouldn't have already been able to Withdraw the coins, I'm not sure. Two-factor maybe?"
"they had a dispute with roger ver and to settle it they used fraudulent documents which the usa proved:

That's a good idea too but I just meant you shouldn't rely on being able to recover something from a burned house.

You're welcome."
Thank you. 
"It is ok, some people belong out xD

Using potential danger of hodling on an exchange as an argument for not using btc, is comedy. Maybe learn to use it before you 'invest', you know, due dilligence and stuff.


@op: Hope you make it, but also hope you learned not to hold your btc on an exchange..."
You shouldn't have a single point of failure like that. Paper is fine but you should keep it in more than one place.

I'd argue that they've grown from a small fortune to a large fortune just recently. Good luck getting those back!
"Truth.  It was a known risk and this is not even a unique account of it.  

Say various exchanges/miners/businesses have figured out the percentage and method of theft, and they're doing it.  

It's just obvious."
I can confirm

It does seem that they are shorter in bitcoins than in manpower, given that they provided like 10+ hours of customer support for free already but I am nowhere close to getting any bitcoins. 
[deleted]
So you're shorting Bitcoin then right?
97 bitcoins! Wow! Just sue them or say bye bye to your btcs
cross post in /r/BitcoinMarkets
I was verified!  
WHY would you trust a third party with a quarter million dollars! ?
looks like you must have chinese name to have that much coin with them
It looks like someone has had access to your account.....
OKCoin CEO wanted a new lambo...can you really blame him lol? Free money.
These transaction limits at the exchanges are a trap.  If you ever send coins in and don't get properly verified you can't get your coins out.  Never send coins in until you are fully verified.
Welp, looks like I'll never use or recommend OKCoin 
"oh man why put so much bitcoin in just one exchange. And of all exchanges, why okcoin.

I think the rumors are right. The chinese govt is covertly confiscating bitcoins."
"What the fuck?  /u/Okcoinbtc /u/OKCoin_Jack /u/OKCoin_Alfred

Why do this to this person? I think its time to have this **translated** and spread throughout asian bitcoin forums (8btc etc)."
Sad that posts like these need to happen before action is taken. 
"Serious question, why do you have 97BTC, (+$270K), on one exchange?    
Are you a trader?    
    
I am not knocking, I am just curious as to why you need so much on a single exchange."
Why the hell would you have almost $200k on an exchange? 
They are making so much more than this, so trying to rob people doesn't seem practical. Occam's razor says they are swamped like every other exchange and have hired an army of new support staff who don't know what they are doing, and something went haywire on their end. A lawyer in China contacting them could set things right, and is probably worth it given the amount at stake.

Why do I get the feeling this type of crime is going to be more common.. 
they are locked up for months  (because of the PBOC lockdown)  and grew to a small fortune just recently.

I will do this.  I will get my lawyer on it on Monday. 
Where do you have that kind of money from? How do you own that much? Fishy
Yeah having 90BTC on an exchange is not smart at all. 
Your Bitcoin is gone, deal with it. What a wonderful currency, isn't it? What are you going to do? Sue? Don't make me laugh.
Oh, and now you want help of Police? I thought crypto was anti government. Laughable.
Thanks for the warning.  I hope they come to their senses, and I hope you get your coins back.  They are offlimits for me, but really no different than most exchanges.  Obviously there may have been reasons, but most folks should NEVER keep this much bitcoin on an exchange.  Too many things can go terribly wrong.
