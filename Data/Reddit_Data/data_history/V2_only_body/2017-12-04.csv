"""The purpose of this meeting is to discuss winning the banking community over to government control, directed by the bankers, for their own ends""

This is a quote by historian Gabriel Koko, not directly from James Forgan

"
"This should be posted in \cryptocurrency
Those are the peeps who need to understand this history. "
"You and me knows about them, just the fact that we are redditors in the crypto space probably gets us in the top 5% of people that knows about it.

I have introduced dozens of friends into bitcoin, some of them have 15x-10x this year alone. Yet, they don't know about the current problems or seem to care

"
"Andreas is all for using bitcoin for everyday transactions. He lives in bitcoin, not in fiat money since long ago. Thus, I can't picture him being happy with the current state of bitcoincore. 

However, given he is one of the main spokeperson for Bitcoin he has to stay as neutral as possible. Could you imagine if Andreas said he supports bitcoin cash?"
"**Hanlon's razor**

Hanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways including ""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."" It recommends a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for a phenomenon (a philosophical razor).

As an eponymous law, it may have been named after Robert J. Hanlon. There are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far as Goethe in 1774.

"> why would anyone post ONLY about bitcoin cash

I'm invested and excited. Despite the fact I hold many other coins too, Bitcoin Cash is the best sound money. Prove me wrong and if u're successful in that my, life will only improve

I've close to 24/7 leisure, but I don't interested in many other subs at the moment. I'm obsessed with crypto currently"
It's pretty ironic reading your initial comment. It's a space clearly designated for bitcoin beginners, yet you feel the bitcoin supporters there are preying on noobs by talking about bitcoin cash from bitcoins perspective. If anything it seems like you and other bitcoin cash supporters are the ones going where you don't belong and spouting propaganda to influence noobies, your behaviour is very well described by your own comment.
If you really believed in Bitcoin you would have already converted all your fiat to Bitcoin by now. See, it doesn't work like that. BCH is one effort to break out of Core's strangulatory grasp that may or may not succeed, but that doesn't mean someone who opposes Core shouldn't support it. That also doesn't mean you go all in right away. There is still a chance of a miracle for BTC, via a fork away from Core or Core somehow getting its act together, and if BCH fails we will just spin off again later. Core has to win every battle. We only have to win once. We have to keep powder dry for the long haul.
"> Instead, when asked about it he says ""it's not smart"". That doesn't really vibe with the narrative he puts out,

Would you say the same thing about someone who has half their money still in fiat, but thinks bitcoin is ""here to take over""?

I mean obviously the guy can't predict the future, so it would be retarded to go all in on bch."
Well that's fucking stupid.
Most intelligent and pragmatic people in this space hates Bitcoin core for technical reasons. You are obviously outside that subset.
"It doesn't need it, the point is that many kinds of experiments can be tried without crowding out and making impossible all the other ones.

Imagine Lightning works as Core thinks it will. It still costs 1 on-chain transaction to open a channel and 1 to close it.

Will that be cheaper on BTC or BCH?

BCH.

Lightning, if it works or not, will be better on BCH than on BTC, no matter what, simply because BCH works better as a cryptocurrency, works better because Core has hamstrung their own coin, on purpose btw, so they can earn fees off the lightning network. (And if Lightning doesn't end of working, Core is completely screwed.)

Sad that they would purposefully cripple bitcoin just to try to get rich, when this tech can improve the entire world if not hamstrung.

But it's okay, they were greedy, we're not greedy; the bitcoin mission to change the world is moving forward nonetheless, now in the form of Bitcoincash, for that I am glad at least."
"What you are trusting in Bitcoin is not the miners but the economic code that make it much more expensive and risky to cheat versus doing the right thing and protecting the concept. They did not spend huge amounts of money and electricity to try and cheat. There are much easier and cheaper ways to cheat compared to being a bitcoin miner.
As a full node, you can reject transactions for yourself, but you can't do it for anyone else as you are not choosing to mine valid blocks to make invalid blocks die in orphan chains. As a full node, the network does not really listen to your work without proof-of-work. As for validating your own TX, within a few seconds, all miners online have your TX picked up and into the mempool. It is fairly secure for most intents and purposes. Self validation is largely superfluous."
PoW is more secure: u have to burn so much energy again to rewrite the ledger
"PoW means it will set a base value of the coin at the minimum price of production. With hashing power based mining, it means the coins are actually backed by energy. The more energy it takes to mine a coin, the more valuable that coin is.
With PoS, it takes nothing to get a coin, the richer gets richer, it's basically a semi-ponzi scheme. The base value of the coin based on production is near zero,."
"Two big problems: coin distribution (ICO?) and ""rich getting richer"" too fast"
Did you link the wrong post?  Because that post is from july talking about the (at that time) upcoming BCH fork.  Doesn't mention dragonslayer anywhere.   
Actually it's a phrase I borrowed from the legal field. Means (broadly) if the source of something is untrustworthy the something is also untrustworthy. 
Nothing exists until it's released to production. End of story. Especially in this sector.
"As a non-american, even if you think Obama was a ""con man"", atleast people outisde of the US found that he was  capable president fitting for a country like the US. Trump is a twitter joke."

"The point is, 1GB blocks are not coming tomorrow. To get to 1GB+ block sizes, we first need to exceed 2MB and 10MB and 50MB etc... And by the time we get to the 1GB blocks, the idea maybe won't be as ""impossible"" as it seems right now.

Other than that, considering that I work with large systems, I know that what seems common sense is not necessarily right. Large systems can often be counter-intuitive.

What I know, is that multi-GB blocks are definitely possible, and not just in future, but right now. In future, sharding across multiple high performance servers might be required to run full node, but whoever will need to run full node will be able to. And because the network will be used by billions of users, there will also be more full nodes than ever."
You missed my point you triggered amoeba.
"Barack Obama was a con man. He's not like Trump at all. 

If you don't know that then you are uninformed. "
"The first paragraph indeed you are correct. Though it's still justifiable to say you should be given a financial/fee incentive to use LN for small purchases as this results in more efficient use of block space leading to greater decentralization. But indeed blocks must be big enough that its viable for everyone to use onchain transaction if they choose even if less practical and cost prohibitive for say a few dollars worth being transacted. 

The second paragraph is where you tout nonsense /r/btc rhetoric. There's 3 implementations for Lightning Network that currently exist and of which your can use. They are in development releases so you wouldn't want to use them for actual payments yet but if you really wanted to you could. That's not vaporware it's something that actually exists and can in fact be used, it's more than just a spec and a dream, it has been implemented. Even if we're a long ways from widespread adoption. "
Yeah. Now, I dug through the history, and man, bitcoin as a whole's history, is just replete will all sorts of controversies. It becomes a question of whether it can overcome all these negative PR.

Because sometimes beginners actually ask questions about Bitcoin Cash. You obviously haven't spent much time on there...
"Honestly, the cryptos that excite me the most are ones that are more focused on enterprise grade applications.

When it comes to everyday cash transactions, crypto could  be accepted everywhere, but its adoption will only really happen if its easier to use than a debit card.  I don't see how this will happen any time soon in the us, but it CAN happen in developing countries.   The fact that BCH is focused on developed, industrial countries in the west and far east, and NOT focusing 100% on places like Kenya (where people have been using phones to transfer money for years) is a testament to their ignorance.

"I didn't call him a scammer. I think he's just operating on another level from all the Bitcoin Cash fanboys. Bitcoin Cash fits a nifty narrative that is technically true - BCH is better for commerce right now than BTC. However, to not acknowledge that Roger makes a TON of money off of this but he's actually just doing it as some service to the community is just absurd. If he REALLY believed BCH>BTC, he converted all his bitcoin to bitcoin cash by now. Instead, when asked about it he says ""it's not smart"". That doesn't really vibe with the narrative he puts out, that Bitcoin sucks now and BCH is here to take over. He's a businessman - like he said, he was a multi-millionaire before Bitcoin. There's nothing wrong with that. But stop pretending that someone who brags about his wealth as often as Roger is doing this from the goodness of his heart."

"For the network as a whole, it does not really matter. Except...

Running a full node is the only way you can be totally sure noone else is doing anything fishy. A full node will do full validation. We want people to participate in this validation, because it helps keeping everyone honest.

Now, the BCH narrative is that only miners need to run full nodes. But if so, then only miners are verifying themselves! I am not saying all miners is dishonest, but aren't our goal to make a trustless network, where you don't *have* to trust anyone?

Now, everyone is of course free to trust anyone they want, but the only way *you* can fully be self-dependent and verify as much as possible, is to run a full node. And full nodes will reject non-valid transactions. Don't we *want* non-valid transactions to be rejected?

I am not saying everyone should run a full node, I am saying it should be a goal that everyone *can* run a full node if they want to."

No that's disingenuous comparison, not even Roger Ver has 100% of his wealth in crypto. Obviously he has fiat. 

We are talking about someone bagging out one crypto and claiming another crypto is superior, yet still continues to hold majority of that ""OTHER"" crypto.  /u/chazley makes a very rational point.

"This makes zero logical sense. Here's the difference when Core ""wins"" vs when Roger/BCH ""wins"": Core releases Segwit, userbase can decide whether or not they want to use it. If you want to continue using legacy bitcoin, great, do it. If you want to use bitcoin with lower fees, use segwit. Roger/BCH doesn't get what they want so they steal bitcoin's protocol and make a new altcoin to get what they want. Consensus vs. a hard fork to get your way. You tell me which is better for a coin that is supposed to be decentralized."
"Ok first off, why ignore the first half of my previous comment that had nothing to do with that analogy. Nothing to do with fiat.

Nokia was big like Bitcoin once....
"If it works as claimed, it could contribute to many use cases, while also not preventing other uses cases. That's a net positive. And since it would work better on BCH than it works on BTC, why not, that just proves BCH is better than BTC even at Lightning, due to cheaper transactions and more capacity.

Nothing is necessary in BCH. But Core is making Lightning necessary on BTC by artificially constraining the blocksize and forcing high fees on everyone."

In a PoW system, that only directly reflects the viewpoints of the miners.
Nokia was/is a company.
But if it's unnecessary that means it is redundant. You say it would work better for some things but don't provide any examples. I think you just are saying what you wish is true, or trying to make bch sound better than it really is.
[deleted]
Which is why a fork attempt with 85%+ miner support failed, right?
I don't, consensus does. You might recall the fork?
"> But if it's unnecessary that means it is redundant.

Use cases can coexist without being redundant. There are a lot of kinds of transactions that should be on-chain, and why you want to retain cheap and abundant on-chain transactions.

And there are use-cases for Lightning as well, assuming it works as they claim it will.

Lightning is not a complete replacement for on-chain transactions. If it were, they wouldn't need anything on-chain at all and could dispense with bitcoin entirely and just sell the lightning network as the new payment system and who cares about bitcoin.

Maybe that's their intention long-term, who knows.

But Lightning introduces layers of trust and human intervention that do not exist on-chain. So Lightning is not a complete replacement and never can be. On-chain is trustless and permissionless, but lightning is not. Sometimes you don't care about trustless and permissionless, sometimes you do. Different use cases, not redundancy.

> You say it would work better for some things but don't provide any examples. 

E.g.: the obvious ones, buying your daily coffee or any kind of repeat corporate payment; settlement between banks, between credit card companies, etc. All the ""in system"" stuff, that is, Lightning is probably going to turn into a great way for the legacy financial system to integrate with cryptocurrency in some fashion.

> I think you just are saying what you wish is true, or trying to make bch sound better than it really is.

It's not a claim that BCH has cheaper transaction costs and more capacity than BTC, that's here and now. Those same things are a plus with Lightning too.

Lightning requires an on-chain transaction to open or close a Lightning channel. The 3rd world person can afford to spend a penny or less to do this using BCH with an on-chain BCH transaction.

They cannot afford to do this now with $5 transaction fees on BTC and with Core wanting fees to go ever higher.

It's pretty straightfoward.

The only theoretical question here in all of this is whether Lightning will end up working as they claim it ultimately will. A lot of us do not think it will. But the worst is that if it does, BCH is still a better venue for Lightning to run on top of than BTC is, because the property of the BCH chain are superior, both in cost and capacity.

Fair enough. It was kinda unclear to me which fork you were originally referring to. There have been multiple forks for BTC within the last 4-5 months.
"Mining was the most centralized in 2009 when only Satoshi was mining and knew how to mine. Though, pools only will grow from here into supercorporations, the whole world will be aware on this business model and some entrepreneurs will always be ready to pick up the slack.

I'm no expert and I don't know if you are an expert either.  But I also feel like something >1mb would be good enough for now...Though I also understand the slippery slope that one day 8 won't be enough and one day 16 won't etc etc until it's too cumbersome to stay decentralized.  There has to be another solution or it wont last forever.  I don't have a strong opinion either way on the short term because I'm not a computer scientist or programmer or anything.  But to scale to huge transaction amounts like 10s of thousand per second, it seems common sense that simply moving up and up to 1gb+ block sizes won't work.

Care to explain where you're confused.
You are trying to do with a comparatively shitty computer what miners are doing with warehouses full of processors. Part of the bitcoin concept is that you don't need to trust anyone as the mechanism for settlement and transaction are currently protected by $750,000 per hour of computing power. Ultimately, if someone is trying to cheat you, it is harder for them to beat miners validating than you validating on your own node. non-mining nodes are pretty much useless.

I'm not sure what makes you think that you speak for all network participants.

> It's a poor comparison.

It's really not. For instance I believe in c ryptocurrency, I think it is objectively better than fiat. I think it is the future. But I don't know for sure. So I won't go all in, I'll keep some of the ""bad"" money just in case.

"I never understood the argument (except from the point of view of large egos on both sides). From my point of view increasing blocksize is a good idea and a more efficient arrangement of the blockchain in the form of segwit is a good idea.

Not for nothing, while I don't like team BCH, their persistence and use of their resources could be why BCH succeeds- but don't fool yourself- this is their project. "

Those two figure heads behavior is what killed Bitcoin Cash for me. Sorry.
Yeah, rBitcoiners read it and isn't censored.
I'd assume that sub does under it given that every single altcoin addresses this issue. It's only Bitcoin that has legacy 1 MB blocks. Everyone else came later and foresaw this problem. 
My theory is that Coinbase knows something we don't about operation dragon slayer. There's already plenty of things that could crash BTC like Bitfinex/Tether, CME shorting. When the price crashes miners switch to BCH crippling the already congested BTC. Then on January 1st Coinbase releases BCH to customers like they said would.
"The core problem is that Bitcoin discussions are inherently highly technical and mostly subjective. For true discussion you need a person who is: a) great developer b) master cryptographer c) has substantial experience with crypto currency development d) is objective

Just a) & b) eliminates like 99% of people from being able hold productive discussion on Bitcoin... and then you get FUD like ""24 terabytes to support Visa network's peak capacity"". c) & d) are tricky when you get to that 1%... because if developer has experience with something, it's hard for him to be objective. You see that with current Core Dev team.

Long term it'll keep being information conflict - trying to spread ""the truth"" and reach some kind of consensus. The only thing that comes to my mind is to maybe build some kind of FAQ and point people to it when certain topic comes up. Like you don't need to guess what block size is needed for Visa network's peak capacity... simply watch this video in which /u/Peter__R and /u/thezerg1 explain details regarding scaling:

https://youtu.be/5SJm2ep3X_M?t=3m10s

There you can see that current codebase can't scale beyond 100 tx/s ... meaning that ~33MB blocks are MAX. With changes /u/thezerg1 made to codebase (multi-threaded queues and intelligent locking) you can get to approx 500 tx/s (which give you 165MB blocks). All this tells you that from codebase pov we are still far away from giga blocks.

As for Visa level capacity - Peter Rizun was talking about 4 billion people x 1 txn per day ~ 50000 txn / second. That brings needed block size to 16.5 GB.

Now - I doubt many people will put effort to even read this condensed version I've typed... let alone do their own research. Or get into scenarios that do not align with their subjective view... like how Bitcoin doesn't really need to support peak capacities, as transactions can stay in memory pool... average txn count and it's trend is much more important than one time peaks.

TLDR: Point people toward places where uncensored, productive discussion happened that answers their Qs. FAQ would help.

EDIT: Ho Lee Fuk... only now read that [piece by Coinbase CEO](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)... didn't know he was that pissed at Core Devs back in 2016. Any idea why the hell Coinbase / GDax doesn't already have option to trade BCH? I know they said Jan 2018... but considering how little faith Brian had at Core dev team one would expect he would be doing way more on his end."
Or maybe Barack Obama circa 2008? Hope and Change!
Please share it in r/Cryptocurrency
On chain scaling isn't a solution, not a viable one. This misunderstanding is what comprises the base of BCH supporters, those lacking a technical understanding, and those who missed the BTC boat and look at this like a get rich quick scheme. BTC provides censorship resistance, while BCH is working hard to buy a cup of coffee....NCH is Ver's project, not a revolution... if it has, there are no users, blocks are less than 60kb in size.
Is it true bitcoin by block stream is developing bitcoin to be faster in the future ?
Post of the month! Thank you for writing this and hope you crosspost to other crypto subs!
Why is it Coinbase understands the problem so well, but did not immediately support Bitcoincash, and still has not announced BCH trading on their platform? 
"What can be done to counteract the false information flooding reddit (particulary /r/bitcoin, etc?).

As one example, I saw a user on /r/bitcoinbeginners claim that the block size limit would have to be 24 *terabytes* to support the Visa network's peak capacity. Unless I'm wrong that transaction capacity scales linearly with block size, then that estimate was off by orders of magnitude."
"Roger ver was on the most recent crypto voices podcast and it was definitely an eye opener for those not involved in btc since day one. 

On one hand, I do want a very slow and deliberate to change platform, just like you don’t want the fed changing monetary policy each day. 

But, Ver’s interview definitely lends some credence to that there has in fact been 3-4 years of slow deliberate debate, that’s ended with confusing reasons from core to not move forward in a few directions "
"Saying scaling was ""unsolved"" and now it's ""solved"" because 8mb is higher than 1mb is pretty disingenuous.   It's not like core devs never considered simply raising the block size.  They decided that wasn't a good enough solution and rejected it.  "

"I hope u/memorydealers sees this as something constructive.

You have to accept that Roger as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" - that's a powerful image and moniker... He has been featured in some bitcoin movies and plays a very very very important psychological role. Now, I really see him as a visionary of sorts, but the video tarnished any logical, practical and technical debates. 

Will non-technical people remember the saliency of 1 MB blocks vs bigger blocks? Maybe. 

Will non-technical people understand Segwit, Lightning network, others and why they are bad? No, most people will see the outburst. In the same way that teens used to focus on Justin Bieber (rather than his music), in the same way that people used to focus on the Kardashians, you get my point? 

You're right, bitcoin cash is a worthy cause. But Roger overshadowed it. His personality somehow, through some lens, became synonymous with bitcoin cash 's identity? Could that perception be changed? Yes, and no.

It becomes a matter of statistics. Say 70% will see the video, and the core announcements/propaganda (as you will), they'll focus on that. 

Who was that investor who had 3 qualificatory questions for a startup? Anyway... 

First question almost always is, **""who's behind the project?""**

Not everything is logical. While Bitcoin cash is or could be the ""real bitcoin"", you cannot help people asking, ""Bitcoin cash's main proponent is Roger Ver"". He did what? Lemme see the video. Oh no. 

I would respectfully suggest him hiring somebody who would handle his social media presence, refrain from responding to troll-baits on social media, focus on delivering a message rather than attacking the other camp, focus on delivering the product. 

Just 15 to 20 years ago, people didn't care about Microsoft CEO's Steve Ballmer's antics. The critics and haters loved it, but the Microsoft team just worked on the product. There's XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10.... What made Microsoft what it is, is that they cared about how the product Microsoft Windows could make people's lives better. We really should focus on how bitcoin cash could do that.

If **Bitcoin Cash** really is true to its promises - **the product has to speak for itself.** The product has to speak for itself. It's the product and the message. 

In my country, the Philippines, the most convenient way to acquire bitcoins (BTC) is only through 1 or 2 websites. Both transact in BTC. I tried sending 500 pesos worth to a friend, in BTC. The fees ranged from 350 to 400. The fee is more than 50% the amount I tried sending. Now, we need bitcoin cash if we really want to create an impact with bitcoin, how do we go about this? How do we, third world people acquire bitcoin cash without having to acquire bitcoin (BTC)??? 

Solve that, focus on the product, focus on the message - everything else will follow.

These things turn people off of /r/btc and that unfortunately leads them to visit /r/Bitcoin. One notable example of this is that almost every post on /r/btc has to do with BCH and not BTC. 

Do our part, speak up be reasonable think objectively and then we can have reasoned rational discussions on this sub about Bitcoin making it a viable alternative to /r/Bitcoin, but in the meantime /r/btc often just picks it's boogie men and rants about /r/Bitcoin without having objective discussions. 

Like seriously try and talk about how Lightning Network is a good innovative thing on this sub and the we need both onchain and off chain scaling and you'll find yourself get downvoted by a bunch of partisans that think Segwit is evil and HTLC are some how magicly centralized and that everyone must be buying their coffee onchain.

Bcash is something related to Zcash. Much more often Roger talks about Bitcoin Cash, and he is excited about Bitcoin Cash just like he was about Bitcoin prior to scaling overheat. Tool to free the world, that's the reason. I'm with him on that"

The Core view has changed completely from what it was in 2011. No one back then even imagined we would have high fees. Or rather, some did but we called them buttcoiners. The buttcoiners didn't come around, instead they kept their skepticism but their jealousy at Bitcoin's success got to them. Some of them decided if this Bitcoin thing is going to stick around they might as well bend it into their own buttcoiner vision of how it should be.
"This is where they are wrong. This solution is at least good enough for now. Even more, I'd say increasing block size should be good enough forever, provided protocol is improved to handle that (for details, see this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0rplj8wSR4 note the author and the date).

If they don't know how to scale before it's needed, they already don't have the aptitude to even think about perfection.
They want a big chunk of the Bitcoin pie. At the cost of loosing most of its value, yet it's still a damn big pie.
">You need person who is: a) great developer b) master cryptographer c) has substantial experience with crypto currency development d) is objective

Bitcoin Tabs has plenty of a, about zero of b, and about zero of c. Bitcoin Cash has fewer of a, plenty of b, and a lot of c as well as significant numbers of non-c.

"The whole point of Bitcoin is triple entry accounting. Triple entry accounting is what makes widespread adoption of Bitcoin a threat to people who make their money by taking advantage of the corruption our current double entry financial system allows.  

Segregating the signatures from a transaction removes garuanteed triple entry accounting for that transaction.

Allowing transactions to be processed off chain removes triple entry accounting. 

The high transaction fees and crippled network through-put are simply being used as a way to force BTC transactions onto a settlement layer, thus removing triple entry accounting and thus turning BTC into fiat.

The only thing that makes Bitcoin valuable is triple entry accounting.  That is the only significant thing distinguishing Bitcoin from fiat.

The BCH split was executed to preserve triple entry accounting, and thus Bitcoin.  "

Neo and icos are not the same. China banned ico, not crypto and certainly not NEO. And vitalik will have no legal problem because he cant stop people scamming through ico with ethereum platform as he doesn't rule over what people do. Criminals are using btc to save their dirty money, should we ban or arrest btc dev? And when criminals are buying guns with $ should we ban $? And no alt wont disappear because btc evolve. Paying coffee with btc would cost around 10$ for a 1$ coffee. Btc will never be a daily currency at this point but a store of value. Whatever early adopters with no financial knowledge, just massive luck, think. Nobody's gonna buy btc at 10k+$ just for daily use. But they might use ltc or grs or vtc or anything with cheap fees and faster tx. Even if btc was a 2 seconds tx currency with lower fees, they would still be too much for daily use
If you can't handle BCH users not enjoying you being seen as a community member you might be in for a difficult future.

erm....
"I saw it, yes. You're taking his words out of context. He said he was a self-made millionaire before Bitcoin to show the interviewer that he doesn't need Bitcoin to succeed for financial reasons. The interviewer was basically telling Roger that Roger was just trying to use Bitcoin to get rich. Roger's response was appropriate for what the interviewer was doing throughout the interview.

Roger has said since the beginning that his interest in Bitcoin is in its ability to circumvent government censorship and to end war for good. It's not to get rich. That's the difference between Core and its supporters and Bitcoin Cash and its supporters."
"> Neo and icos are not the same. China banned ico, not crypto and certainly not NEO. And vitalik will have no legal problem because he cant stop people scamming through ico with ethereum platform as he doesn't rule over what people do.

China banned exchanges, AND they banned ICOs from being promoted in China.

"And then its not valid anymore?

I dislike that whole thing just as much as I dislike Blockstream and /r/Bitcoin censorship stuff."
I mean, I need to eat.
Bezos makes most all of his money from AWS, the profits from Amazon are pitiful in comparison. You are actually being forced to use AWS all the time.

Well I can see you are coming from the core perspective but to me as a Bitcoiner we did not fork it's Blockstream with segwit that forked from us. BCH is the Bitcoin I signed up for in 2010. When it comes to the future of a coin it's a lot about network effects BCH has that. I keep seeing more and more people converting to BCH as Blockstream keeps failing it's project with fees going up. The future of a project also depends on who's willing to support it personally Blockstream made Bitcoin a corporate coin for me and I won't support that and I imagine most people wouldn't want to own money that a corporation controls. 
[deleted]
"It was sarcasm, but the fact that all visible Bitcoin Segwit supporters are somewhat ""strange"" is clearly visible.

1) LukeJr believes the sun orbits the earth

2) Adam Back wants companies to use tabs to keep track of transactions

He made extraordinary claims and then retracted. End of
"One corporation has a business agenda that requires that all dissenting voices to their takeover and subsequent crippling of BTC be quietened. Whether it is Jihan Wu, Craig Wright, Calvin Ayres, Roger Ver or others, they all find themselves subjected to the same treatment: a torrent of abuse starting with a few Blockstream employees and then miraculously picked up and perpetuated by large numbers of sockpuppet accounts on social media .

Did you know that Rick Falkvinge was a child molester? No? Because this is what is now stated as fact by the same accounts. 

No difference. Just smear campaigns exploiting whatever weakness they could find in big block supporters and distort"
Or maybe they don't have a business case that would prompt them to judge him too quickly? I personally don't think there is a case, either way
At the time, they were. 
"> There is a difference between compromising your values and doing the polar opposite of those you oppose.

"And you make shill accounts with no history talking nonsense. Who is paying you?

Anyway, it’s not only his coin. You’re free to buy some. I have some. I know many other people that have some. I also know that many other people are involved with bitcoin cash and it’s development. you know, the original way bitcoin was designed.

Bitcoin cash (and the original bitcoin before segwit) was a grassroots movement, not some corporate takeover by Blockstream to piggyback their block control mechanism into the original bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is simply what bitcoin always was, without the 1MB block limit. Nothing more nothing less :)

You cannot discern between boasting and reacting to someone who is talking to him and talking over him in a belittling manner. Roger is always talking in a respectful manner to people in these debates and he gets treated like shit. He puts up with that, most of the time, but once he started peppering in insults, Roger is trying to communicate to him... Look buddy, you don't even know what you dont know
Ya but bitcoin has gone from 5 cents to 11000 thousand and I guarantee you a lot less people know who roger ver or anyone like that is than you think. There's not even 100k subs on here and this is the only reason I have heard of him. 
"Is there an evidence thread for this tantrum?

I'm a newcomer to both subs and they both seem ignorant in their own ways. It's really hard to tell up from down."
"Maybe the third option is ""a retard""."
Okay that’s great. But he needs to learn how to not react emotionally. Did you see the interview with him and the Core Dev? He cursed him out and flipped him off and also came off as whiny “I made a million dollars before Bitcoin”. He was very unprofessional 
Oh snap
"Yes. You have basis for that. I find it funny, for example, how some youtube posters with no history to speak of and all the signs of being generated on the spot, seem to post harassment and about ""bcash not being bitcoin"" in non-crypto videos of roger for example.

What I don't get is why you have to put someone who either intentionally ruined their reputation or is a conman there in the mix. That one is obviously not blockstream's fault so you discredit your argument."
"Perhaps. It doesn't matter to me what they think though. I like those two, and I dislike him. 

CSW doesn't care that I think so, so why should you?"
And the appearances of a clearer hind vision seem to imply that their failure was in getting hacked and robbed from, not by being corrupt and stealing.
He wishes.
Downvotes from puppets is my payment, but if Roger is interested is paying me to bash /r/Bitcoin I wouldn't complain.
"Just as bad, if not worse. ""elimination of the state"" 

Yeah, Ill take the state anyday over multibillionaires like Jeff Bezos raising a private army to kill anyone that stands in his way. He probably wouldnt even need to raise an army, just use kill-bots and droids at the rate technology is progressing/already at."

"> Cheering btc while spitting on alts lile nobody is working on their tech beside btc dev? I also support btc but still recognize tech like ETH or NEO.

I am a strong supporter of Bitcoin BTC. I do not spit on Alts, instead, I prefer to make a case of why Bitcoin BTC will regain market share from Alts again.

With new scaling solutions on the way, more privacy, etc, some Alt Coins will no longer be needed, and others will drop in value.

I do not personally like Ethereum, because so many scam ICOs have been launched on the Ethereum platform. I think that Vitalik will face major legal problems in the future, because these were launched on his platform.

NEO, I do not understand why it has value, as it was launched as being similar to Ethereum, but for the Chinese Market, which has banned all ICOs!

I agree that he's done very much for bitcoin, so I respect him. Only thing I can't understand is why he is so angry and emotional most of the time. If I had his bitcoin account, I'd be chill af, spreading happiness and love all around. I haven't seen him like that, rather the opposite.
"While I agree with the OP and praise is deserved, any business man is sure to take some heat. He's just gotta brush it off which he has done well so far. My only issue is that Bcash naming, by responding to it has fed the trolls, whereas the approach of ignoring it was probably a better tactic as we will have the last laugh with adoption.

In that recent video where he issued an apology, I didn't think was necessary but ultimately it shows the human side of him which I can appreciate.

*edit for grammar"
"Its easy to claim to be a libertarian when you're a multi millionaire, just like its easy to claim that beauty is only skin deep when you're a super model. 

Shouting at someone and deriding their business, because you were already a millionaire before you bought bitcoin, shows that all this posturing is just that, posturing. He doesn't give a shit about you really, money matters to him more than ideals, despite what he says in a slick pr interview. "

"I respect /u/MemoryDealers - but I also understand why a lot of people don't like him. His passion often puts him in positions where he spreads himself thin. Mt. Gox video is a great example of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0

It should be noted that he later issued an apology video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIJ_jpmwzo

But of course, look at comments on the video and see how many people accepted Roger's apology. I personally do understand Roger (easy for me since I lost $0 on Mt Gox). If anyone should be villainized there - it's Mark Kerpeles.

The long term problem is that Roger seems to repeat this mistake often. Like that recent debate with John Carvalho - I still ponder wtf was that about. John obviously trolled with ""BCash, BCash, BCash"" and yet Roger flipped out because his arguing for decency of discussion went nowhere. Worse yet, Roger switched to ""I'm millionaire, so I'm smarter than you"" route while in parallel acting completely childish. Of course, when everything was done - Roger issues another apology video.

So all-in-all - I really wish /u/MemoryDealers focused more on his strong suits and harnessed his passion in productive ways. He is obviously genius-level investor... even people who hate him don't deny that part. But he definitely needs to do away with childish parts of his characters and taking cheap shots... long term that kind of stuff hurt him way more than people he was aiming at.

EDIT: Speaking of that debate... I love this follow up video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKnAiPI9NJc ... ""Stupotika"" ;)"

Roger Ver is both greedy and corrupt.
But think... Are those really mutually exclusive?
and mt. gox is solvent!
but he's a self made millionaire!
i used to like him, but the way he started talking about his money... thats a very odd way to say passionate 
"Yeah, people seem to forget this came after at least four years of wrangling trying to get the BTC devs to join us here in the future. If the normal Bitcoin users are frustrated, I can't even imagine how annoyed Ver must have been, there he was a cryptocurrency diehard pushing BTC adoption everywhere and the very development team working on the coin seemed to be intentionally driving it right into the ground at Blockstream's behest.
"
He runs a subreddit called r/btc and yet when I look at coinmarketdesk, btc refers to one coin and this sub seems to support a different one and oppose btc. I held before the split, still hold all my bch and I for one think both chains have people doing excellent work. But the existence of this sub seems very duplicitous to me. Bch seems to be an excellent product. Why then should this sub not be named r/bch or r/bitcoincash?  This advertising method reeks of low self esteem. Social engineering is supposed to be the opposite of what crypto is about. Crypto is about privacy and independence. I separate Ver from bitcoin cash. I believe bch is excellent. At the same time I think the marketing of it by some of its advocates is really sketchy. I think he should change the name of this sub if his reputation is his first concern. Otherwise, he should understand why the damage has occurred as it is sensible. 
wonder why he hasn't started a bcash bounty campaign
His lashing out shows his true character though. Look down on people in the porn industry and only take criticism from millionaires. His apology doesn't fix this. The bcash crap is a childish thing to get worked up about. Would've been bigger just to ignore it.
Bcash...  lol.
"Yepp.

He worked so hard to divide the bitcoin community and pump bcash. I'll give him that."
I personally dont like ver or jihan, but i do like what BCH actually is.
If only his talent matched his passion.
Demonizing leading personalities is quite common political strategy. Roger Ver choose this role himself, I am sure he knew what will come. 
Serious question: what has he done for the bitcoin community?
And he’s smart enough to not need a Patreon even though he has been in BTC for years
"Well, someone coined the term ""Bitcoin Jesus"". Hardly surprising it would be polarizing when he gives up on Bitcoin BTC and realizes that steps have to be taken to create a Bitcoin that doesn't suck and isn't at an active threat of death spiraling the way BTC is. 

Nothing ilke that is going to go without a lot of people getting worked up about it. "
He acts like a child and lets not pretend that there wasnt a coordinated effort to straight up lie to people about what is really bitcoin and what is not. He knows better and he chooses to market his project. Maybe he is a decent guy but his ideals and execution of those ideas sucks.
In a sense he really is the Bitcoin Jesus, right now he's being crucified by all the people who chose to reject the bitcoin white paper.
"I agree so much! He's been around since the beginning and has put his money where his mouth is, constantly fighting the good fight for BTC to be successful. There's a reason he and most of the initial ""founders"" of the project have switched to Bitcoin Cash - this is what BTC was meant to become. For anyone that wants to learn more, read the book ""Digital Gold"" documenting how BTC was created and eventually became the global superpower it is today."
Why do people talk about Roger Ver and Jihan as if they're demagogues or the scum of the earth? The only conversation that should really matter is the merits of BTC vs BCH
"I'm with you. Roger is doing and has done a lot for Bitcoin.

I respect and admire him."
He sold firecrackers on Ebay he's literally ISIS
also isn't he a self made multi millionaire?
"There are legit reasons ... skepticism of Roger Ver is healthy. In crypto, you shouldn't put trust in anybody. Roger's character got out of hand in that interview - even though the interviewer was being a prick, you need to remain calm if you're promoting something.

Roger Ver has been in cahoots with Craig Wright someone who claims to be Satoshi.  While the jury is out on this one, it looks shady when he's also hanging out with Calvin Ayres, who was listed as a wanted man for sketchy things.

Roger Ver encouraged people to invest in Bitcoins at Mt. Gox.

You can try to debunk these if you'd like ... but don't think Roger is being altruistic in ""helping"" Bitcoin. Rebuttals are welcome"
"it aint complicated.  stop calling it ""bitcoin"" and the hate will stop. "
"Every day as I learn more about Roger's past and following his online activities daily, my respect only keeps growing for the dude. 

Everyone with a head screwed on knows there is a coordinated attack on every Bitcoin Cash supporter, be it a person or a whole company."
"Who wanna Bitcoin to be censorship-resistant would inevitably become the enemy of the censorship.

It's Roger's honor to be one target of the smear campaign."
"When insulted, his go to insult was bringing up the size of his own bank account. That's what they call ""showing your hand"".  No altruistic, voluntarist whatever, would ever do something like that. It's not something he can take back. "
No one in the community that is a public figure has more passion that he does.  He has my support. 
Let's remember this guy came to bitcoin because he is a voluntarist and a libertarian. Bitcoin's goal was to put financial sovereignty back into the hands of the people to fight against tyranny and make freedom flourish in this world. This is why I love him, he is a modern-day hero just like Satoshi
Yeah blockstream and the dragon's den have turned all the ignorant new people against him.  It's a pretty shitty situation that they've created.
The hypocrisy of the BTab trolls claiming Roger has manipulated the market, while they are actively engaged in a FUD campaign against BCH is almost comical.
He doesn't get the hate you describe. It is manufactured by a handful of people using sockpuppets. The same applies to Jihan Wu, Craig Wright, etc. Anyone who publicly oppose Blockstream is submitted to this puppet show of fake hate and unpopularity. It is a joke
"The truth will rise.
They can't debate about scaling, so they just attack individuals."
True 
When I saw him crying on youtube about wars...that's when I got serious about cryptocurrency.
"I don't know him but his actions and words have increased divisions within the Crypto community more than any individual I know of.
Doesn't make him worthy of hate but he is a very rich guy who thinks the world needs to fall in line with him and his beliefs. It won't."
It's one thing to be passionate and another to be toxic. In other words I'm fine with him supporting Bcash but trash talking Bitcoin and their supporters is not necessary.
Let's be honest, he's been a quantum douche about it in then manner he's gone about it. I respect him for going after what he believe in, but doing so in the manner he has guarantees blowback. I also think he's a big boy and doesn't really care. If he's an emo pussy, then I'd feel sorry for him for a number of other reasons. Let's not forget, he's likely made 100s of millions of dollars off the chaos he's created. I think he'll be fine.
Never, ever feel sorry for a billionaire.  Believe me,  he does not feel sorry for you.
"There's literally 2 types of people who hate him with a passion:

>Paid trolls and sockpuppets

>Losers who are desperately looking for approval from the above / the feeling of belonging to a group

I don't think any of the 2 groups deserves his attention, he should really learn to ignore them instead of letting them get to him."
I find the way people are so attached to Ver and so vested in his emotional well being in this sub really weird. Especially considering most people here probably don't know him personally and he probably doesn't care one bit about anyone swooning over him in /r/btc. I mean I saw someone in another thread asking him if he's been getting enough sleep. Seriously? You can certainly support the guy's stance but this is abnormal. 
I like Roger. The one I cant stand is fake satoshi. Roger should stay away from him.
This is the guy who predicted Bitcoin since early days, I'd follow him anywhere
"He's getting hate and mockery *because* he
> has really done a lot for the bitcoin community

Agree it is disgusting but it says more about cultural decline than about Ver.  I hope he does not care and will not let any of that slow him down.  I think he is more on message than Andreas, who for all his expertise can't put 2 and 2 together regarding small blocks (or won't).  This space came into being to upend fiat banksters.  Roger said in a recent video that he is in St. Kitts.  If I were in St. Kitts I'd be relaxing and not caring."
He really did a lot for the Bitcoin community and I would go even further and say he did a lot for the cryptocurrency scene in general. I don't think he deserves the hate he's been getting, but I have to admit that I don't agree with all his positions and sometimes I believe he could express himself better to avoid getting some free hate.
Or you know, try not to idolize and follow people like it was intended by Satoshi.
That community is simply toxic. They will demonize anyone who don’t agree with Cores official agenda.
I support Roger, the amount of shit he has to deal with is crazy
"He is getting hate BECAUSE of what he has done for the bitcoin community. The same happened to plenty of others before Ver.

The hate is coming from the blockstream/digital currency group/AXA alliance who have an agenda of destroying bitcoin by twisting it into a centralized payment system they control."
"The absolute state of /r/btc on December 4th, 2017.

"
Haters gonna hate, don't care. Bitcoin cash will be the 2P2 exchange currency of the Globe. "
If your reading this Mr. Ver, you’re the man. 
i totally agree. After researching a little history of the direction of BTC, it is clear to me that BCH is truer to the real Bitcoin. Roger said once that BCH was forked to save Bitcoin. I believe the ridiculous troll comments are of two camps 1. Paid by those that have a vested interest in breaking Bitcoin (Blockstream/AXA/bankers etc.) and 2. Those that bought into the drama and sold BCH when it forked.
I am a small blocker and I completely agree. It seems a lot of people, especially new people to this space, have no idea who Roger really is. They just love to jump on the hate wagon. Roger has done more than most to promote bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. He is a friend of the community and should be respected. He didn't earn the name bitcoin Jesus for nothing.
he's a hero
If that's how you interpreted why he brought up his wealth, you're a compete retard.

when you watched legacy bitcoin become corrupt and broken, you'd be upset too
You must be new here. Roger Ver was the main figure speaking out against blockstream turning bitcoin into an unsusable p2p currency.
He had enough money to chill and relax before bitcoin came into being. Bitcoin is his personal agenda which is why he is so emotional about it. It goes way beyond money.
While I do support Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and am myself a target of /r/bitcoin paid trolls, I have also never thought about it like this and you have a point. If I was a billionaire, I would be chill... he is too angry/emotional.
"> His project is now a store of value and not anything like the peer-to-peer cash-like system

You are projecting the shortcomings of BTC onto BCH right now. 

I've been noticing a lot of trolls doing this lately. You guys are losing this battle so a new tactic of yours is to obfuscate the truth by projecting exactly what your problems are onto BCH...So anything bad you say about BCH...it is true of BTC..."
You need to step out of the way, you are a bad advertisement for the whole of cryptocurrency and are dragging down BCH which needs more mentally mature community members.
He's not the most talented politian, but I buy his passion
"thats a very subjective point of view.    
i strongly disagree. Roger Ver has been a driving force for Bitcoin and continues to be. he is a valuable speaker for bitcoin (cash).    
if you dont like him - fair enough.    
you dont have to."
"> He needs to step out the way

Why? I like his passion

We were all expecting it to come from outside sources.
No, that would be Theymos who has divided the community.
It is necessary if the other side as that way. He who takes the high road in war is the one who loses.
Ver is a straight up salesman sometimes I cannot believe how many people just eat it up. The inclination to immediately give him the benefit of the doubt seriously is reminiscent of t_d and for as much shit as this sub gives to core subs for censoring or negative reception for speaking against core, you will get downvoted to China for sharing anything critical of Ver. The dude is nuts. 
Should I only feel sorry for people who feels sorry for me? Are you criminally insane? What kind of backwards unsound logic is that?
"That's the kind of ""we are better and want to be martyrs"" attitude that prevents pragmatic thinking.

"You really need to read more rather than post while so uninformed.

"Read this:
https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7haa6p/bitcoin_divorce_bitcoin_legacy_vs_bitcoin_cash/
to see what he has done for Bitcoin. Anyone who made money from BTC should be grateful to Roger.

Roger hates the government.  Roger saw Bitcoin as more than just an investment.  He saw it as a way to shrink and weaken the government.  Because BTC can no longer do this, he's supporting BCH."
"Just like when Vitalik mentioned inappropriate porn to make a completely separate point, Roger mentioned his success in business to make a completely separate point. 

That he should be listened-to and respected because he knows what he’s talking about when it comes to a product succeeding in a marketplace. 

That was the point he was making, but just like with Vitalik, low-IQ sheeples can’t think that deeply and latch onto the wrong thing. "
He may not be the best spokesperson or good under pressure. I don't read too much into the statement other than he was feeling personally attacked (and responded poorly). I will say that Ver should probably chill a little bit. He doesn't have to prove himself to anyone.

They are afterall a more likely candidate for reproducing success in other ventures due to their track record.

Anytime I hear white paper or ""Satoshi's Vision"". I immediately shut down."
"No a whitepaper per se, they reject freedom of choice

They deny freedom of markets to choose open blockchains' name, they deny freedom of miners to run any software whatsoever, they deny competition in a form of ""Bitcon vs altcoins"" etc. **They're statists**"

Your use of the term ""in cahoots"", which implies shadyness, but don't describe in what way exactly they've been ""in cahoots"", and what would make it worth using that expression.

You also claim it's shady that he's hanging out with Calvin Ayres, who was a wanted man for ""sketchy things"". What were those sketchy things? A healthy dose of skepticism in this case makes me wonder: if the things he was wanted for were that sketchy, why wouldn't you say what they were?"
">  Roger is being altruistic in ""helping"" Bitcoin

but he is still helping bitcoin, even if he is doing it for himself, especially so since it only shows his greater dedication towards it. 

Now take someone like Greg or Adam who have bad mouthed Bitcoin, Satoshi, and bitcoin's design more than once, who rejected bitcoin when they learned about it, who have been misleading others through specious, and ask why they are involved with all this and what they have to gain. It doesn't seem like they even care if bitcoin exists or not. "
Craig Wright gets all the hate and rightfully so.

Similar to this one for Bitcoin Cash, I've noticed.

"Roger is shady as shit, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Debate is healthy for Bitcoin. Roger does a great things fostering that while promoting crypto in general.

However, when you rig an algorithm to print more coins out of thin air (similar to a central bank), buy a bunch of cheap coins, then pump the price, and create a bunch of bagholders that will never recover, that's not a very cool thing to do.

Hopefully Bitcoin Cash starts to develop a roadmap and their phantom development teams step out of the shadows. Having a philosophical competitor to Bitcoin is healthy to the environment as no one has a monopoly on good ideas. I look forward to seeing what innovation comes out of Bitcoin Cash. "

That's the reason the BTC die-hard troll army are now after him with pitchforks and torches. 

After a lot of propaganda and lies, they've branded him as a traitor to the cause over there, as opposed to trying to save the Bitcoin brand with a coin that adheres to the whitepaper as much as possible. BCH has a modernized DAA and larger blocks, and that's about all the differences to the original AFAIK."

Then I look at how they work, and if I came here from 2014 and looked at them both there would be no hesitation in saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, and legacy bitcoin is not really so much anymore"

Its prudent to point out the hillary crew used the same tactics against the DT.
"I could only give it a quick glance, sorry.  It seems that he makes a highly simplified mathematical model of mining, in a highly unrealistic scenario (two miners), and concludes that the two cannot drop down to one.

I don't see how one can apply that conclusion to actual bitcoin mining. 

Suppose that he removed all references to bitcoin, mining, and resources, and just described an hypothetical abstract game of two players with those mathematical rules.  I suspect that the proofs and discussions would remain just as correct and consistent.  If that is the case, I would say that the paper is just a result (or maybe a simple exercise) in abstract game theory, with no relevance to bitcoin.

In reality, the forces that push mining towards concentration include the lower costs (hence higher profits) that come from economies of scale, better deals with suppliers and utilities, greater leverage with local governments, wider choice of locations, etc..  It seems to me that these forces will continue to exist down to the two-miner endgame -- and may be even stronger then.  Did the author model those forces in the paper?"

"Ignoring the paper entirely, and thinking only about the real situation:

+ Ostensibly, it is unlikely that the number of pools will drop to less than 3.  If there are only 2, one will occasionally have more than 50% of the hashpower, and then the public reaction that happened in the GHash.io might happen again, forcing that pool to split.

+ On the other hand, nothing really prevents the same people from owning or controlling pools that comprise a majority of the hashpower; or the forging of secret agreements or cartels with such power.

+ If there are only two independent groups owning most of the hashpower,  it is in their interest to make an agreement to reduce their hashpower while preserving their proportions.  

    For example, APool has 40 EH/s, BPool has 60 EH/s.  APool and BPool could agree to cut their hashpower by 50%, keeping their relative market share.  That is equivalent to them merging into one pool and splitting the revenue 40:60.   After the difficulty readjusts, their revenue (in BTC) would be the same, but their costs would drop 50%, so their profit would increase, maybe even more than 50%.

    The lower difficulty could attract other entrepreneurs to set up pools.  However, unless these new pools are quite large, the cartel could drive them out by reactivating their dormant hashpower for a while.   (They could also simply orphan all the newcomer's blocks, but that would be inelegant and might soil their image...)"
"> This could mean 100

The correctness of the bitcoin protocol depends on mining being distributed over a very large number of **independent** anonymous miners.  That assumption is required to make the key assumption plausible: that a majority of the miners (counted by hashpower) will care only to maximize their chance of winning the next block's reward and fees.  

100 independent miners is already too few for a network with 1000 users; definitely so for a network with 1'000'000 users.

20 *presumably* independent pools are totally too few, for any number of users.  If the top 4 pools (all Chinese) formed a cartel, they would have a majority of the hashpower.  The top 6-7 Chinese pools would have about 2/3.  That is not a decentralized system anymore.  I am quite sure that, if Satoshi looked at [this chart](https://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=4days), he would immediately conclude that the experiment failed and the bitcoin protocol does not, after all, solve the problem it was meant to solve.

(Before you say it: the individual miners do not get to see the contents of the blocks, and don't know what mining software the pool is running.  Most of them  do not care about ideology and politics, they care only about the pool's payout and other technical details that affect their profit.  If the pool decides to implement a soft fork, they will not notice and probably will not care.  If some pools form a majority cartel and decide to use their power for some plan other than selfish greedy mining, that plan is almost certain to also benefit their mining members; so actual miners are more likely to migrate *to* the cartel pools than away from them.)

> if you compare all of his writings to BTC and BCH you will see that he does not describe BTC + 2nd and 3rd layers + LN + smart contracts. He clearly states that the block size will increase as there is greater demand.

Yes.  But he also does not describe the non-mining relays that were inserted between miners and clients after he left, and which thoroughly break the protocol's key concept and security arguments.  

And he also assumes that traffic would grow much less than 50% per year.  Which has in fact been mostly true, apart from the lump increases due to drug traffic, mixing, and gambling.  But that is heresy to the small-blockians, who want ""Visa level adoption, quick"" for the price to ""go to the Moon"" -- and thus let Greg take over and wreck the system, just because he promised just that."
Even with the context?
I'm surprised you've been on reddit this long and don't know what /s is. It's used at the end of a statement to denote that what came before it was sarcasm. 
"Further to my other comment, you gave me an idea once that in the future -- when the block reward went to zero -- that if fees were ""too low,"" then a single miner could buy up a bunch of hash rate and set a minimum fee for next-block service.  If the fee was reasonable, many users would just pay it to avoid the risk of slow confirmation.  When I read this paper, I thought that perhaps Dimitri's framework could be used to model the no-reward end-game for bitcoin.  "
"He actually models the _N_ miner situation and then studies the 2-miner situation separately.  

Your criticisms are similar to one of the reviewers of the paper, who felt it was rather ""empty"" game-theory that would apply equally-well to many scenarios.  

Anyways, I thought it was still quite interesting because I see the underlying results holding even when the other forces are included.  Bitcoin mining will likely never be a monopoly, but it will always be ""centralized"" to the extent that individual miners still retain a degree of pricing power."
"> set a minimum fee for next-block service.

The top 4 miners can do that now.  They could announce to everybody that the min fee will henceforth be a flat rate equivalent to (say) 0.10 USD/kB, plus 0.2% of the total output value minus obvious return change.  

That would be a soft fork, so a simple majority of the mining power can force it on everybody, with no voting or debate -- including on the other miners, because their blocks will be considered invalid by the majority if they contain transactions that pay less than the new mandatory fee.  

Any pool that fails to enforce that new fee policy will see his blocks ignored by both the majority miners and by all clients and services, and will have no revenue.  Its member miners would  immediately flee to pools that enforce the fee.

The majority cartel could even enforce the new min fee immediately, without telling anyone.  But of course they will want to announce it and give at least a couple weeks advance notice, so that the other miners and wallet developers can implement the new fees too."
Comedy gold.
Of course not the CW is a television network it's not like it's Satoshi Nakamoto.
To successfully mine a block you need to provide proof-of-post-it.
A few days ago someone posted about exactly this happening to physical gold when it was still the main store of value, people sent paper IOUs to each other instead of gold. The 'gold on paper' system failed and gold reserves don't accept it anymore. Same will happen to counterfeit bitcoins and vaporware shit tokens.
this system will work for bcash too.  No segwit needed.

"Yes and that's awesome for his own business and your day at the bar. The important point then is the moment when he gets tired and you need to pay your tab. And when it's 60$ then I still wouldn't want to pay 6$ fee which is like 10 of what I owe to Ronald. Why would I if there is Cash or Bitcoin Cash? 
Would really like to visit this bar by the way! "
"> This argument has been made again and again and it assumes that the said ""mining cartel"" is going to slash its own throat to forge a chain that pays less than mining said chain.

And this response has been offered again and again, equally based on an unproved assumption: that there is no change that the cartel could impose that would make more money for them in the long run than sticking to greedy mining on the current chain.

If six  known fixed mining companies was fine, Satoshi would have said so.  But then there would be no need for PoW and all the rest.   His solution was only worth looking at -- only deserved to be called a ""solution""  -- because the *essential* hypothesis of thousands of independent anonymous miners seemed plausible at the time.  

> You only need enough decentralization to avoid censorship.

Bitcoin now is useful only for illegal payments, and only because they don't care for ""decentralization"", only for ""lawlessness"": the willingness to process payments without regard for KYC/AML and without possibility of seizure/blocking by law enforcement.  That is what is euphemistically called ""censorship resistance"" by those who love bitcoin only because it provides such service.  

But while lawlessness is almost a necessary consequence of decentralization, the latter is not necessary for the former.   If it were, then bitcoin would not be used by that population, because it is obviously not decentralized.  Fact is, they do not care at all whether there are 10'000 miners, or just 6, or just one.  All they care is that the miners will process their transactions, no matter what they are.

The totally centralized Liberty Reserve (LR) was totally fine for that market, until it was shut down.  In fact, it worked infinitely better than bitcoin.  They switched to bitcoin only because there was no replacement for LR available.  For them, bitcoin is just a ""LR 2.0"" -- slower, clunkier, more expensive,  less reliable than the original, but the only thing they have now.  They will switch again to a centralized LR 3.0 if that becomes available.

">Because people are expressing their opinion that Bitcoin should remain peer to peer cash as Satoshi wanted... 

You know what, that's a good point. Satoshi also wanted proof of work to be based off of CPU power not GPU power. If you're going to claim Bcash is the true bitcoin because it follows what Satoshi wanted then all GPU mining must cease immediately. CPU minng is the only true proof of work as per Satoshi's white paper.  "
In r/btc. Isn't that the point in this thread?
Now we're going around in circles... we're back to the point I made that /r/btc was a protest against /r/bitcoin, so of course it's often talking about /r/bitcoin.

Incorrect. See what satoshi said about specialized hardware.
"It can be any party that wants to provide a channel and make *n* off of each transaction. 

Anyone is free to do that, the barrier to entry is only as much as you want to put in the pool. 

The channel/pool/network can be across any number of parties, and transactions can traverse across multiple channels to find their destination. (Sound familiar?)

This approach enables micro and nano transactions at billions of transactions a second. Something entirely new. "

Because most people here see btc as a take over by blockstream.

huh. weird.

no, Adam literally said that since LN isn't ready, just keep a tab with the shop.
It's the most obvious, straightforward solution with no actual downsides. So painfully so that you have to turn bullshit into an artform to convince people that their solution - that one day they'll be able to pay through the nose and jump through a bunch of hoops to inefficiently tie up their money in multiple contracts - is better. 
It's not, it's by far the simplest solution that has the *immediate* effect of relieving congestion by increasing the maximum transaction rate
