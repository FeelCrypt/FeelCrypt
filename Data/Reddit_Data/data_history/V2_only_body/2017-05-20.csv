"> Sound money is THE use case.

so true.

reading through the comments here, you were the first to mention what Bitcoin does that Ethereum will never do. Sound money.

This is why i am a strong believer in Bitcoin, because we cant have 'alt sound money's'. only one. and that is the use case I was sold on. "
"I don't think TSLA has turned a profit in a single quarter since it was incorporated. Maybe once https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=TSLA. I'm pretty sure your overall impression of TSLA's business model is incorrect, though. Same deal with Uber, they rely heavily on investors and cut corners to gain market share.

Satoshi said a lot of things dude. He's kinda bailed, leaving us to fix this mess. I agree that price is driven by fundamental value _in the long run_. That's what I mean when I say the price will revert to the fundamental value when the speculative value crashes. It doesn't look like we're quite there yet, though.

Other than that I think we're in agreement: bitcoin is useful as a store of value because of the fundamental value provided by its immutability.

Bonus edit: people in Australia can pay their bills with bitcoin. Is that fundamental enough for ya? ;)

Immutability is insufficient for fundamental value.  The number 2 is immutable.  It has no economic value.

I don't think you would need to open and close a channel for every purchase. And even if you do, other transactions that don't will be put on the LN instead, opening up the main chain so that it becomes cheaper and easier for whoever prefers to make the transaction there instead. It's win-win no matter whether you prefer LN or raw transactions.

"The transaction malleability is a security threat. It is a fix for something that isn't an issue.

Scaling is something badly needed. Malleability is something many don't want and see as a bad idea."
"I agree. It's only that the OP made the assumption that disk space was the limiting factor for increasing the block size. I don't think so, as you can upgrade the PC you are using to run a node.

OTOH, it is more likely that you don't have control on the speed of your internet connection, which is the case for me.

BTW I'm more inclined to increasing the block size first before implementing Segwit, even though I'm still a noob."
This. 
"

From my understanding If I run a pre segwit node and recieve a  normal transaction is should be able to validate independently. 

What do you mean they will not be considered full valid nodes, what are the implications? "
They're working on the patent first. 
"Yes, I agree. By the way, it's quite funny how the inventor and creator of the Bittorrent protocol has such a hard time to understand the Bitcoin protocol. So hard he doesn't.

And I've never heard of anyone getting double spend attacked after receiving their first confirmation, so I think the 6 confirmation  caution is very exaggerated. I mean if you're unlucky and a reorg makes your block not count then the transaction is still there in the miners' mempools waiting to be confirmed again anyway. Just be sure the attached fee is high enough to be reasonable."
"Absolutely. It might conceivably make a difference to a pool that wants to be able to validate a block as quickly as possible but those guys aren't going to be worrying about putting their hands in their pockets for a couple of sticks o' 4G

The simple truth that's downplayed is that a non-mining node can actually dispense with a lot of stuff (connections, transaction forwarding, high bandwidth) and still be very sure that the blocks they are receiving contain valid Bitcoin transactions. Fewer connections does conceivably mean being more susceptible to DDOS (or potentially less if they do it right) but if you're receiving at least a block every ten minutes on average and it validates and the difficulty looks right, you know you're good (you may want to wait an additional block or two but we're all waiting for six confs anyway, right?) :) In fact, there's no actual need for a Bitcoin user to participate in the gossip protocol at all and if Bitcoin were more modular, we might have seen other options come about. 

They may not be ""doing their part for the network"" but if you're resource starved, I don't think others are going to mind too much. Just like leechers in bittorrent. Someone has to be the last person to receive a block or transaction. Realistically, there are going to be quite a few at the end of the distribution pattern anyway."
I think you are both right. Originally there need to be empty blocks because there would often be 10 minute stretches of time where zero transactions where broadcast. At this point, there is never that kind of shortage of transactions, so it's just miners choosing to mine empty blocks for a variety of possible reasons

"Fair enough. I just don't have much problem with people calling a minority fork an alt. I feel like we always end up drifting into ""Ship of Theseus"" territory if we think too hard about it though."
Bitcoin Core devs don't get this. They have a hammer. They think everything is a nail. 
Once those coins have been part of a segwit transaction at any point in history how are you going to validate and sign?  You can't because you don't understand segwit transactions.
I see your point about classifying it as an altcoin that's a Bitcoin spinoff. Personally I just think it's practical to make the classification separate the idea of a Bitcoin spinoff from the idea of an altcoin, because it makes it easier to write if you understand what I mean. Especially if you want to write it frequently. And since there's such a difference between an altcoin that has a different genesis block as opposed to an altcoin that has the same genesis block, I think its warranted to refer to those types of coins with different words.
Yes. There is a spectrum of security that is applicable through Bitcoin. Some people don't seem to be able to get their heads around that. For very large transactions, you probably want those 6 confirmations. For smaller and/or revocable ones, 1 or even 0 conf could be perfectly acceptable.
"I dont think that would be forked off. 

that just means they wont download the blockchain off your node. But you would still be able to sighn and verfiy transactions those would be seen as vaild. 

With a HF those transactions would signed and verified would be seen as invalid leading two creating two coins. 


You could say they would be soft forked. because they are sort of kicked out but not entirely.  

"
Sure. I would actually classify it as an alt that's a Bitcoin spinoff. Which I don't have anything against and I actually support the btc_fork if we can't get things resolved eventually.
You would be for slavery and working within the system back in the day. 
I don't trust claims from a side which is bypassing the established procedures for discussions of BUIPs. Core's procedure is proven compromised by BS, anything against BS will be rejected, so those processes are useless at this stage
Storage is less of an issue than bandwidth and block propagation though. Bandwidth varies for people around the globe and block verification time doesnâ€™t scale linearly IIRC. So many variables in play because increase in verification time and mining centralisation can lead to skewed incentives or a better chance to game the system which is why we're at a deadlock in the scaling debate.
I'm actually quite puzzled by the fight within the community. Who cares if segwit is activated first or blocks made bigger first? Why not just do both together if its such a big deal. Lets move the fvck on.
You are forked off the network.  Segwit nodes will see you as basically a non full node.  Just a spv wallet with full blockchain.  
Ha. I actually liked the Joey spinoff. But IIRC there was only one season of it so I suppose I was one of the very few that liked it or it would've gotten 10 seasons too.
At the rate storage tech is growing, it would take between 8 and 16mb blocks to keep pace.
How many times does it take to tell you that nobody is worried about hdd space before you understand? 
Or use a Intel NUC with a celeron processor. Also low power consumption and because it's a PC you can run the OS of your choice on it.

"> Bitcoin needs visa-level transaction throughput

Not now."
Of course not. They spent so much money paying off Luke Asshole Jr and the likes, if they allow bigger blocks, all their investments go poof. Now THAT would be ridiculous.
I really hope a big bock version of bitcoin forks off. I have no doubt the value of both chains combined will be much greater than today's value with the scaling debate over.  And the chain with the most value and utility will always be called Bitcoin.
At 6mbit you would still be able to handle 100MB blocks using only a quarter of your bandwidth!
"The Bitcoin protocol includes incentives to keep miners ""honest"".  If you think that these incentives are inappropriate because certain miners are incentivized to do something you don't like, then I suggest you come up with a proposal to modify the protocol.  For such a proposal to be taken seriously, it would need to analyze the costs and benefits of the existing protocol vs. the proposed protocol.  For such a proposal to have a significant chance of being adopted there would have to be a significant net advantage.

I live in a small town in Sweden an I have 1000Mbit connection for almost no money. My friends in a small village a short drive from here also have 1000Mbit. If you have shit connection then don't run a node. No need to cripple bitcoin.
Small blocks, small skin in game, small thinking. 
Good for you, but you understand that's exactly the point? A lot of people don't have that
Except people also have to share a whole connection between family members, that ever occur to you? Cripple your whole network for everyone sure...

"> Some people want a token without developer reversibility, infinite inflation, poor QA.

True, but how exactly is that relevant when discussing scaling to 8 MB/10 min?"
Excellent

That is a conspiracy beyond the moon landing and the flat earthers.
"Please ""enlighten me"" what are the other concerns?"
"What running a node from home has anything to do with scaling.

 In 9 years no one lost coins because its SPV wallet was tricked in any way.
What use have you to monitor everyone else transactions?

SegWit require you to download 1 MB+3MB of witness data to verify the blockchain. If you don't download the SegWit data, you are not verifying anything.

So, everything you said about scaling the blocksize is true with scaling using SegWit. The added problem is SPV mining is encouraged by SegWit because you could build a full block without knowing the witness data, as it is transferred separately after the block, so miners risk to pile up valid blocks over unvalid ones. It would be tricky to discover two or three miners had built their blocks on top of an invalid or unverified block.
Three miners could be enough to make the majority of the hash rate and could be unwilling to throw their rewards to build a different branch fully verified.

If you don't trust the miners with larger blocks, they become even less trustworthy with SegWit."
"20 megaBYTES /down  4MB up per second uncapped for  ca. 35U$ a month in Europe.
I can run 10 nodes from my home without even noticing."
sub blocks is an answer.  blocks are filled with transactions in real time, with a sub block issued about every 30 seconds.  when the time comes to publish the full ten minute block, the propagation time is dependent on only the size of the last sub block, because the rest of the full block was already agreed to.
"The funny part bring that running a node currently takes very little bandwidth. The bandwidth argument is just as bad. They are acting as if all the nodes are using some third world dial up connection.

Running a node is hardly noticeable compared to regular Internet usage. If you watch Netflix you wouldn't even see the difference in having a node."
Why not Bitcoin Cowards. They are so scared to scale.  
I don't think low spec hardware should be used for the internet money. This is money anyway, if you don't care about your money, who should?

I'm currently connected to 12 peers, if I continually send/receive 8mb blocks what is my monthly bandwidth usage? genuine question.
eh, I dunno. Some people want a token without developer reversibility, infinite inflation, poor QA.
">the rest of the full block was already agreed to.

Agreed to how? Blocks currently only get ""agreed"" because they come with a proof of work. Conflicts get resolved by whoever has done more work (i.e. the longest valid chain wins).

How does this work for ""sub blocks""?"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CFwy_DC1OQ

edit: it's still using proof of work.  a sub block has a difficulty target that would take miners less time to find.  so proof of work is used to organize little packets up until the full difficulty target is found and the full block is published, at which point only the last sub block needs to be sent."
"Segwit is fix for transaction malleability. Scaling and feature signaling are secondary benefits.
"
Of course it's not needed and it makes all future blocksize increases harder to implement.

"Sucks for those people. That in no way should be a determining factor though.

It is like saying that mining difficulty should never increase because some people still want to mine with graphics cards."
Thats $2, to open and to close.
Segwit isn't needed though. Segwit is an over complicated solution to a very simple problem. 32 megs of data isn't much at all.
What do you do when 8mb blocks are full in a year? It doesn't scale fool.
But segwit nodes will not accept those nodes as valid full nodes.  Go look it up.  They don't want people to know they get forked off like that but they do.  
You have the social skills of a wild monkey. 
"I think you must of mis read my comment **100MB** blocks! So 10MB blocks would use 1/40th of your bandwidth to verify all your personal txs should you wish to.
