The dude was profiting off of millions of dollars in illegal sales of illicit shit. He made his cellmate's bed, he's gonna sleep in it.
"has anyone been able to verify if Ross is actually running this twitter account?

edit: oh, i see...signed letter..."
Nobody even knows it is him and they are already trying to impersonate him, #deepcoinprotect Ross is giving away ETH ! [https://imgur.com/a/djo7r15](https://imgur.com/a/djo7r15)

A way in?

He writes tweets on a piece of paper and they write it for him.

The FreeRoss account has retweeted it.  I assume that's about the best confirmation we can get.
 Financial sector shouldn't be scared of blockchain, it should accept it. Crypto and blockchain is our future anyway. And blockchain technologies have already started to help people. Good example is CREDITS company: CREDITS offers a blockchain solution for human capital management to Andhra Pradesh Government and cooperates with a university in India [https://medium.com/@credits/creditsinindia-d4778592ff77](https://medium.com/@credits/creditsinindia-d4778592ff77) 
Yeah into the outside. We are all locked out here on the other side of Ross.
I assumed he doesn't have direct access but is telling someone what to write.
So basically he can't freely speak his mind unless it doesn't offend anyone. Glad to hear from him nonetheless.
"Such a sad situation. One thing about r/btc is the people here are much more philosophically aligned with my views on the world.   

We mostly agree Ross has been badly mistreated.  Maybe in a perfect world non-violent commerce wouldn't be a crime but at a minimum a life sentence in comparison to others is so drastically over proportional it's obvious it's political and to made an example of.  "
I am happy and honestly shocked that they gave him access to a computer
You think he'll use his twitter in an attempt to escape? I don't think so, that seems a bit much.
