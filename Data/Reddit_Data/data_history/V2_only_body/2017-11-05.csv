I can't recall the part where Satoshi mentioned Segwit.
"> shit on the low adoption of segwit and how it does nearly nothing

So we're admitting this now? You know for the longest time they shoved down our throats that segwit was a ""block size increase, full stop."" 

Remember that? "
EDA is compatible with the white paper, in fact. You should read it, eventually.
I actually think he's being sarcastic, if you look at the choice of words, he deliberately makes it sound over the top.
Fairly sure he's being sarcastic.
Which is hilarious because everything he said is true haha. 
this is a know troll, use RES to mark them so they are more obvious, then you can have more fun laughing at their suily attempts
Eda seems like something thats definately not in the whitepaper.
"Because it was called Bitcoin.

You know how some of you BCH supporters love to shit on the low adoption of segwit and how it does nearly nothing? That's because segwit is optional. You *can* use it if you want, but you do not have to. So it's Bitcoin with an option to use something additional. 

And I am very aware that BCH is closer to Satoshis vision than what you call segwitcoin is, but it does not matter. Bitcoin is something different than what Satoshi imagined. We can both cry over that, but it won't change reality at all.

Build Bitcoin Cash to something beautiful and then users, value and everything else will follow. Forget about Core and Blockstream. They are out running their own show that has **nothing** to do with Bitcoin Cash."
Because it’s bitcoin according to Satoshi’s whitepaper
"I have to ask if you've ever actually read the 9 page whitepaper, because you don't seem to have any strong understanding of bitcoin at all. 

come back after you read it and let me know your thoughts on your own comment."
"rbitcoin is just getting an influx of noobs when its price pumps.

These later get banned and come here when their dreams of escaping censorship are let down ;-p

> Can someone list the developers for BCH at the moment?

Yes. For the node software , it's the developers for BU, Classic, XT, ABC and parity-bitcoin - and hopefully others in future.

But there's really vastly greater circle of devs - who build wallets, faucets, mixers, exchanges etc. that are just as much 'developers for BCH'.
"
Because the truth is that the number of stupid noobs are much more than the number of people who can think independently.  In fact I think at this stage, the branding effect is much more important than the underlying technology, the reality have shown that which coin get the bitcoin name get most injected capital, no one cares about which blockchain it is
"I meant in terms of security (total hashing power) and a stable rate of return (consistent price gains), BTC looks better, right? I don't know tbh,
it would just make sense to me that coins in the original chain will always remain valuable."
Yes exactly, I'm just saying the tone changed after BCH.
What it is to be bitcoin is more important though. That’s what gives it real value. Consider the old buffet adage about weighing and voting. The price might suffer if the brand is confusing, but it doesn’t change the underlying qualities of bitcoin(cash). Indeed it just creates a buying opportunity!
Can you show me where he said we should restrict capacity to push people onto L2? Or that forks are bad? Or that users need to run full nodes?
Segwit adds unnecessary complexity. The good parts of it can be implemented without that complexity as a hard fork. You can find much more info about this by searching (my first goole result: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5jqgpz).
Introduction of a new attack vector
"Immense amounts of technical debt, a massively inflated codebase, and the fact it broke compatibility with years worth of developer libraries which need to be rebuilt to work with SegWit.

Better just to have none of it. SegWit is not required for Lightning Network or any other 2nd layer so Bitcoin Cash can and will do 2nd layer networks if it's a good proposition."
Bitpay would be big, maybe they waited the DAA to jump in.

What is type 1 communication? 
If nations fall, Bitcoin (and Gold) goes up. A lot.
"How does one quantitatively determine ""close"". Honestly not sure with segwit and EDA. "
As someone new to the BTC stuff, and stumbling across this thread, is there a synopsis of this stuff anywhere? As a new person in the game, I did the average joe thing of doing some nicehash mining, buying a few hundred dollars of btc on coinbase, and generally just reading a lot over on r/bitcoin. 
I though the tx malleability thing, which SegWit solved, is a problem for 2nd layer networks?
"EDA calculates difficulty by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. In that sense, it is in agreement with the whitepaper. On the other hand, SegWit is incompatible, see relevat text."
"Well I'm sure big blockers all have their own reasons, but for me personally, I try to do my best to keep the character assassination and slander to a minimum and talk purely about how core is deceiving people. 

Blockstream and Core have been deceiving people and lying to the community about scaling Bitcoin for years now. It is in my economic interests and my moral interests to help others understand the truth that I understand - That Bitcoin is supposed to scale on chain to reach billions of users as a decentralized peer to peer cash system, liberating us all from the chokehold central bankers have over our financial system, taking away their power to steal from us and manipulate economies to create wars etc., increasing our quality of our species. The world can be made into a better place, but I do not believe it can happen without reform of the monetary system, and I believe that reform may be found with scaling Bitcoin as originally designed. The white paper is even encoded into the blockchain, so all this confusion and debate is quite unnecessary. 

So that's my motivation. It's about wanting a better world, a more free world and financial prosperity for myself and for others. The anti-scaling propaganda is very powerful and it is standing in the way of that, and core is complicit with their deceit, but make no mistake, there are bigger forces at play. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/743qb8/is_segwit2x_the_real_banker_takeover/
"
Fine - but why bother with Blockstream and Core then?
If you wanna stick that close to the letter then EDA doesn't fit either, because it calculates based on median, not average.
The difference is people call Torvalds a bit of a jerk, but nobody says he's an antisocial troll with a history of sockpuppeting 
"So there is not a single developer opting to put his name on the project apart from this ""collective"" hand waving about dev teams that only tried to fork bitcoin in the past  failed and are now obsolete

the only person of the developer community that supported this crap is now pushing his scam ICO 

and trolls like you can't be bothered to show an empty github because... it would show that there is nobody technically capable of doing such work.

Gotcha. Now off back to roger boy, shoo"
To that I can agree. More people that are not interested in the big picture of bitcoin, but the price of the unit. Sad but true story.
Thanks. By how much did SegWit inflate the codebase, do you know?
he clearly said we should never have full blocks, but all you corecenter lvoers don't mind ignoring that
Really? I do not remember this, do you have a link?
bitcoin = whitepaper compatible, legacy bitcoin =!=
">  Isn't Bitcoin Cash the future of internet money?

No, it's the future of money. "
"Actually, it is. In the whitepaper, there is no claim that the algorithm must supply 10 minute blocks in line (that may be an impossible task), only a claim that ""difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour"". There is a question how well does EDA target the average (there is a better way, as it looks), but that does not mean the algorithm is not targeting the average number of blocks per hour."

I'm sure you've heard of a thing called Google. Stop trying to waste people's time.
Hehe I tried to be specific about why it looks like a better store of value, but if you insist on calling that demagogy I can't stop you :)
Money means people have stake in news flow so we see more anti-btc content than we used to and more FUD over price.
Yeah, good point.

"> perhaps this sub became somewhat more retarded

In what way more retarded?"
Historically, with btc, yes.  However, there are so many other variables that contribute to market gains/losses and things have been changing and continue to change for btc.  When the btc fork happens on around Nov 16th, no one really knows what the value of both will be.  One could dominate the other...the new one or the old one.  Could be they compete directly with one another so much that the price of both starts to drop and bch's value could start to climb.  I know that, historically, btc has been a reliable, sound platform and bch is a fork of that platform before all the segwit stuff was added.
"> BTC looks better, right?

That is demagogy. Bitcoin Cash exists since 1 August, time too short to make comparisons, SegWit coin exists for even shorter time. Before 1 August, they were one chain, no comparison."
lol wut
I'd be careful assigning blame on the stupidity/inability of new adopters. Theres probably a lack of transparency in the financial instrument and DEFINITELY a problem with the regulation of exchanges and information providers.
Are you referring to the white paper of the coin worth 7.500 USD? 
I dont think an algo thats supplying 1 minute blocks is in line, with the whitepaper.
Sure - but why bother listening to them? Isn't Bitcoin Cash the future of internet money? 
I dont recall where satoshi mentioned EDA either
Satoshi laid out the guidelines for which fork should retain the bitcoin name. Bitcoin is that coin. 
"SegWit partially solves tx malleability (SegWit tx are fixed, legacy tx are not), something which could have been done much cleaner and without the massively inflated codebase.

Tx malleability makes 2nd layer solutions easier, but is not a prerequisite. There are already solutions on the table to fix tx malleability for BCH anyways, it's just not a priority."
Do you have a link to the Github? I am curious about the rate of contributions, etc.
Exactly. And that is what 2X and Bcash are having. Middleman initiatives. First one coming from corporations, second one coming from miners. 
Why is this so important?
"Why? And I am mainly talking about the non-noobs. People that know about both. So why are the #s dropping here compared to r/bitcoin.   

Just like with 2x I don't see this majority everyone keeps talking about here.  Right now this looks like a minority chain, with minority support.

Can someone list the developers for BCH at the moment?"
"basically the entire community was behind the deign of bitcoin, given by the designer. This makes sense, they read about something and invested in it, they obvioulsy wanted to get what they invested in. 

Satoshi left Gavin in control of Bitcoin, Gavin decided it would be better for bitcoin if he wasn't the only one in ontrol and grabbed a few devs who were around and had done a few commits and gave them committ access. It turns out he did a poor job vetting them. A few years later these devs and the 20 or so regular contrinuters to core ( don't be fooled if people sya it has hundred of commiters, Most made one or two commits, found the people rude, and left never to come back) started to say they wanted to change fundamental aspects of Bitcoin and they didn't care what the community or data supported. They wanted to turn blockspace into a scarcity, to make blocks always full. Well Satoshi explicitly told us how to avoid that, so the community as a whole didn't want that, but the 2 main english speaking bitcoin news forums, btctalk and r\bitcoin, both started censorsing history, facts, and banning people left and right, most of the banned were earluy adopters and people who had knowledge of the system.

"Not that late at all, but I do grieve about not getting onto the Bitcoin train a year ago.

"Yip this is why I was able to invest with confidence. 

The developers were never in control. "
I guess I'm just confused at how the market has decided what is and isn't bitcoin 
Okay I’m REALLY late to the crypto currency game and I have $100usd to play with. Where / how do I get in?
Could you explain to me what part of Core Devs is corrupt? I'm not entirely caught up with the debate, but my understanding is that there's a large disagreement causing the fork, not any corruption.
"If BCH is so popular, why has this reddit gone from about 40% of the active users of r/bitcoin to about 15% of the active users at any given time. 

Shouldn't this new bitcoin cash be a bigger hit? "
I'd love to quantitatively measure the r/btc effect on market opinion, in the end the market decides all 
"In the beginning, /r/btc was creared as a much less retarded sub for bitcoin related content. Then, a new coin was born specifically for this sub, which means that the memes and motives changed and perhaps this sub became somewhat more retarded. 

BCH actually *is* a big hit. It's the second biggest coin, even though very young. Bitcoin is what it is, it's the oldest and arguably safest, but in no way usable as the next generation of crypto fueled day-to-day currency. Bitcoin had to evolve in order to actually be used globally as a means of transaction.

Bitcoin (""classic"") may continue to be the best *store of value*, but I think it's safe to assume that Bitcoin Cash is doing well in the market right now for a good reason."
Such gaslighting. Smacks of DGC talking points.
Thanks for the tips!
Your argument lost what little credibility it had right at the end there
Curious as to an example of said corruption?
"Last time i checked Bitcoin project was open source development software. If you don't like the software go write your own and call it however you like.example MyBestCryptoSoftware. You are nobody to decide what devs are going to write unless you contribute on GitHub and people like what you do. Other way around it is first stupid, second it is stupid and third it is stupid.
Question: What we will do if miners become corrupt? "
What I don't get is if Bitcoin Cash wants to be so different from bitcoin why didn't y'all just change the name to something different from bitcoin for fuck's sake
I think one thing the community didn't expect back then was the explosion of get-rich-quick people wanting to take a quick ride, and Silicon Valley sharks trying to twist Bitcoin at the protocol level (backed by media manipulation) for their own purposes. We kinda though the experiment will be long and drawn out, growing organically with commerce over a few decades, strengthening with every financial bust in the fiat world - the halving schedule that goes out to a hundred years implied as much.

Noobs hear about Bitcoin Legacy first
You are not late. I'd say you are among the first waves of early majority (https://www.ou.edu/deptcomm/dodjcc/groups/99A2/theories.htm).
as soon as people do any sort of research, they are drawn to bitcoin (cash) because it's everything bitcoin is while the legacy chain is not
"> Bitcoin (""classic"") may continue to be the best store of value

I don't see a reason to differentiate that one is the best for store of value.  BCH is every bit the same store of value as bitcoin segwit1/2 but it has the added benefit of being much better than the aforementioned as peer-2-peer currency."
this sub is much older than bch 
Or both 
It's important in the short term at least, people are going nuts over Bitcoin, specifically. Big corporate entities are putting money into that, specifically. If what is now Bitcoin suddenly goes off into left field and money evaporates, it could have a brutal effect on all cryptocurrencies and their future. 
I used to go to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency when I first got into this. It wasn't until someone from this group made a random comment that made me curious and start researching. Bitcoin will grow because everyone new to cryptocurrency will go there first and they censor everything. 
why?
And BitPay. Just imagine a seamless integration so I can just choose when buying stuff at Steam.

"Too much ""dumb money"" came into the scene (as you said) *and* too many people fall for propaganda when they think they don't. Not enough critical thinking and too much cognitive dissonance in the average r/bitcoin blockstream followers heads.

Many of them *hate* being proven wrong, they need to come to the conclusion themselves.

Theymos, Blockstream, they all knew what they were doing with the censorship and media control. Typical action from certain parties to be frank.

I've seen good intelligent people fooled, and stupid people fooled over the years, and both come back to the truth. If this was 40 years ago without type 1 communication they would've succeeded, but not this time :)"
"The fiat world is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. After all this time of massive manipulation the system is teetering. The derivatives bubble alone is in the quadrillions now - and that's all completely imaginary money backed by nothing.

But of course, the ""cryptocurrency world"" isn't a separate thing. If nations fall, it won't remain unaffected."
"> backed by media manipulation

"Oh, it matters quite a bit.  If the price went up due to pure greater-fool-theory (""aka speculative mania"") then all this talk about a ""store of value"" is just like the sales pitch of every other speculative bubble in the history of man.

If the price went up for some other more fundamental reason, like if people were using it as actual currency in droves, if companies were adopting it left and right, if it was transfiguring the way that commerce is conducted online — then that's a totally different story.

the purpose of bitcoin change a lot with segwit implementation though
"Well, people are using it as a store of value / speculative asset in any case. 

The whole issue feels like sports team rivalry at this point. Though I guess that's to be expected when people have chosen one side or the other and there are real-world consequences for them being right or wrong. Yes, we need to increase the blocksize a bit. No, that won't fix it. "
"Oh yeah.  I was talking with this other person the other day, he was quite concerned about the ""2X corporate takeover"", removing the power from the hundreds of Bitcoin Core open source developers cannot be a good thing he said.  I responded that if 2X comes the new bitcoin, most developers will probably continue contributing - the big problem is the 3-4 maintainers owning the github repo having veto power on any proposed changes and consistently vetoing any move to increase the block size limit.

"I don't know, I think you *can* compare btc with other stores of value. 

For example, gold, the classic one. Yes, gold is a physical asset you own, it's somewhere secure in a vault, etc. But buying gold is not too simple, and there might be some risks because you usually can't actually inspect the gold you own. Bitcoin risk may be higher, but it's a different kind of risk, and it's still very safe. The risk of bitcoin is mostly related to investors losing confidence, not any kind of attack or failure. 

Then you have just holding some currency/treasury bonds. Sure, those are also very safe, but then you're subject to relative devaluation. You can diversify to many currencies to an extent, but it carries a lot of bureaucracy.

The big one is bureaucracy. Few valuables allow you to move between states and have your wealth relatively safe and accessible. In some places you can dodge taxes, in others you can hedge against inflation. Is all of this worth $100B ? I have no idea. It is worth something though. Somewhere in the $10B-$7T range imo, so it's (by *it* I actually mean the aggregate market cap of all cryptocurs) price should be between $750-$500k, assuming no institutional crisis."
Either the price went up and everything else followed or everything else followed and the price went up. Doesn't matter. BCH isn't BTC unless everything reverses course (and who knows, it might).

"What utility does the U.S. dollar have? What utility did beads and feathers have?

All something needs to be a store of value or a currency is mutual trust that somebody will still want it tomorrow. 

Before you say it; yes. The U.S. dollar is backed by the U.S. government declaring that it has value. The Bolivar is backed by Venezuela in the same way. It doesn't matter without trust. In my estimation cryptocurrencies are better at garnering trust because it would take massive cooperation by governments to manipulate them and I just don't see that happening."
And imo the greatest risk regarding centralization is that of the development process...
I have two questions:  What, in your opinion is the benefit of running a full node.  And, hoe many people have been ripped off because they were lied to by their SPV wallet service's node?
Yes. It's ludicruous to suggest that every user should run a node, and the overwhelming majority don't anyway, even if you lower blocksize to 200KB. People who run nodes should have an actual interest to do so.
"And almost all of those places have business packages that cater to people who run websites. Seriously, we've been through this debate before, we can't stay at 1MB or 8MB because somebody out there has 512Kb uploads. There's a line to be drawn beyond which nodes can _only_ be run at datacenters, but that line is not at 1MB or 8MB or even 64MB.

In order to decentralize, increase the number of businesses who care and will pony up to run a toughened node - that's sustainable. You can't base a network off people buying RaspPi nodes, connecting it to their garage wall and forgetting about them. "
"It's a false narrative that block size will cause centralization.  It's also a false premise that Bitcoin will become a centralized paypal-solution unless every participant in the economy can run their own fully operational network node at home.

If you want to receive and verify the blockchain, you only need only some 4-5 gigabytes of inbound traffic per month with 1MB-blocks, multiply that with 8 for 8MB-blocks.

At the other hand, the centralization risk is very strong when there isn't enough capacity in the network for ordinary transactions.  People will be forced to keep their coins at the exchanges (featuring fee instant internal transactions, and reliable relatively cheap outbound transactions).

Lightning is a nice concept, but in reality if it gets popular we'll end up with some few (maybe just one) big hub that all transactions goes through, that's an even worse centralization risk."
"His point still stands. Bitcoin's decentralization shouldn't be based on volunteerism, and it isn't, that would be a weak security model. I guess thanks for trying to support the network, but once we have widespread adoption businesses will be running their nodes if necessary and paying the higher server costs. Decentralization is not defined by having every user run a node. There is a point where it is ""good enough"" and no takeovers/shutdowns are possible anymore.
"
"> I assume if you hodl a large enough amount or run a significant enough business to care about blockchain integrity, or actually have a large enough mining operation (you know, the only reason one should run a node; volunteerism is not a sustainable model)

Are you actually suggesting that individuals should not be running nodes?!"
There at a lot of places around the world where you would never be able to download 1TB a month. It’s not only America that has sucky internet.

Yes surely OP chose Comcast. Everyone knows ISPs in America are not monopolies at all..."

Maybe you should switch away from Comcast, dude. The rest of the world has heard of no such thing.

Also it takes $20 a month to rent a VPS that has way more bandwidth than that - I assume if you hodl a large enough amount or run a significant enough business to care about blockchain integrity, or actually have a large enough mining operation (you know, the only reason one should run a node; volunteerism is not a sustainable model), renting such a VPS or even a coloc should be easy enough."
Thank you!
While I agree with your point there is no need to attack the user for being a 'cheapskate'.
Then in a year or two all the sudden you need a 5tb hard drive to store the ledger... that is the problem. I’m running a full node right now and always have. It STILL uses nearly 10gb per day and I have 1tb per month limit. If I were processing 8mb blocks I would be over my data cap and have to pay 50 extra per month for unlimited. This is the problem with larger blocks and centralization. 
"""What utility does the U.S. dollar have?""

Are you serious? Well, for starters - you can BUY stuff with it. 

""What utility did beads and feathers have?
All something needs to be a store of value or a currency is mutual trust that somebody will still want it tomorrow.""

...and that trust comes from the fact that it is liquid. That you can spend it to transfer into e.g. a house or buy food etc. THAT gives underlying value. 

""Before you say it; yes. The U.S. dollar is backed by the U.S. government declaring that it has value.""

Fuck the government. The US dollar ONLY has value because it has utility. It is no longer backed by gold, so the moment people don't believe in it anymore and hence won't take it as payment (the chicken and the egg), it will tank. Big time. 
Bitcoin (legacy)'s problem is that it's underlying value in that it can be used as payment for various goods (utility) is eroding because of high fees. That will eventually undermine Bitcoin (legacy) as a store of value. 

""The Bolivar is backed by Venezuela in the same way. It doesn't matter without trust.""

That I agree with. 

""In my estimation cryptocurrencies are better at garnering trust because it would take massive cooperation by governments to manipulate them and I just don't see that happening.""

That is true. But as I said, a crypto with utlility will always win over a crypto with low utility and liquity. Bitcoin Cash (or some other alt with better utility) will win in time, if Bitcoin (legacy) keeps having high fees and low capacity on-chain. That is matter simple market mechanics and therefore will it's store of value erode as well in time. "

RBF was implemented by Core and there are several wallets supporting that kind of transaction that make it easy. Oddly enough, it was much more difficult when transactions cost a penny and confirmations took ten minutes.
I disagree, it is very much possible to double spend. 0-Conf used to be fairly risk free, it is arguably no longer so.
"I counter with.  

Lets add some bullshit code, Segshit which no one uses and people still pay the replace by fee. 

What a joke.  "
Your server can't handle a 32 MB block every 10 minutes? Maybe you should get a better server and stop being a cheapskate.
You clearly haven't tried to run a node, have you? My _home_ connection in a modest apartment can accept and transmit 256MB blocks filled to the brim every 10 minutes without breaking a sweat. Or do you just go by memes instead of math?
"If the lightning network ends up working (I'm maybe 70% convinced that it will) it will create channels wherein there is immutability on-chain without actually writing to the chain. Think of the lightning network as a protocol for sending bitcoin transactions as packets wherein if anyone stops cooperating then those transactions get written to the chain but everything stays in-channel otherwise.

I foresee LN being centralized; but if you don't like who you are ""banking"" with you can say ""FU"" and force the transaction to persist to the chain, simply by paying a transaction fee and they can't do anything about it - which is good enough in my book. I'm curious who the Visacoin will be; anyone with 100k or more Bitcoin that wants to be I guess.

My big concern is that opening an ""account"" with a channel requires creating a multisig address and depositing bitcoin on-chain... which means an up front transaction fee... which means someone with 500 Satoshi can't play (probably)... which is a problem."
It’s not that they can’t support multiple coins, it’s that they won’t support bad actors with malicious intent.
"Source?

I remember reading but I could use more info."
That’s how it is for a crypto that no one uses like cash... the REAL bitcoin is being used by an unreal number of people right now and has unprecedented exposure, they will need to scale no doubt and I believe we will be at that 1 penny 10 minutes place soon. But for right now a less than 30 cent fee for a less than 24 hour confirmation is great for the number of people using it. (Confirmations are pointless anyway since once the money is sent it’s sent, period. No way to reverse a tx 
Testing wasn't done on a 1GB block, they mined a 1GB block. There was no info on how long it took, the parse time, etc.

"> I just sent a transaction for 30c and got included in the next block

I just sent a small BTC donation - very small transaction and it cost me $4.50.  Even with that fee it did not get included in a block for over an hour. I find it hard to believe you are sending transactions for 0.30 and getting them in the next block. "
Show me your 30 cent fee transaction being included in the next block and I’ll show you my $5 fee transaction taking 16 hours on Thursday.
"Look at almost any block and you'll see wide variation, especially if you're not considering the sizes of the transactions.  

[Here's one](https://blockchain.info/tx/a4bf59bb25f07a1843bd23f29c7bc3f782f40ba3ec687221432eb42d268dae7b) with a fee of a few cents that took 57 minutes, and [this one](https://blockchain.info/tx/34537631d837a69e3a4d912241daadb9e9d24e971630431fe08cff9c51fee8d8) took almost 48 hours.

"
"> How is it that I just sent a transaction for 30c and got included in the next block, but STILL I see this FUD in r/btc? It's like there is some kind of agenda.

Anecdotal evidence, BTC is design for low capacity and high fees.

You manage to send a low fee tx great, you seem to suggest low fees are good.

Then you should look at BCH.
"
u/someguy123
The thing about high fees is that it's not just a cost burden upon ourselves, it's an extra cost burden on the business when they want to utilize their crypto revenue. It's logical that those companies would prefer not to have to pay such fees themselves, and push that cost burden onto users, especially if other options are available.
Sure but if the company ever wants to actually send the BTC anywhere they will have to pay a large fee because of all the tiny inputs.
They will have to pay a fee as well when they send that Bitcoin in order to cover their other costs.
For a month, maybe.
email them and ask them to accept bitcoin cash which is what they were told bitcoin was, low fees and all
Yes.
"People disagree on the intended purpose. Right now the purpose is speculation; neither BTC nor BCH are ready for mass adoption as currency. Just because BCH has lower transaction fees for its current users doesn't mean it could support the purchasing of even a moderately sized city. BTC is proving to be a better store of value / speculative asset because ""Bitcoin Cash"" is not ""Bitcoin"" if you go by block difficulty / adoption (which we should). 

Bitcoin can handle 7tx / second. Bitcoin cash can handle a whopping 56tx / second. If the average person does 1tx per day then you need 11tx/second just to serve 1 million people. If we're looking at exponential growth on either chain, we need some other mechanism for scaling pronto.

Edit: edited for math."
"This is odd because almost all of my transactions are sent with a fee of less than 30 cents and get confirmed in less than 24 hours. 

Is that ideal? Absolutely not! Hoping they work out their scaling issues in the upcoming months. "
[deleted]
Yup that's a no for me too.
Instant classic.
What a shame. Remember sometimes is political not a problem with the coin tx fees although they’re up $10 is the platform profiting off customers & not being honest. 
Pay in $BCH http://hodlmonkey.com
I thought the transaction fee is payed by the sender not the reciever, so why would the surcharge have any relation to fees?

I tried to pay for my Nitroflare membership with Bitcoin (like I usually do) and they have temporarily stopped accepting Bitcoin, which really annoyed me.  I'm thinking they're waiting to see what happens with the hard fork.
those CEO's are right. the price is because of people want to make money. Not to use . 
Is this a screenshot of privex?
/r/btc believes its insulated from shills and astroturfing
24 hours!? why are you waiting that long? less than a cent fo 10 minutes is how it should be. 
"3 month old account, 1 post karma, 26 comment karma

....totally not a shill..."
"The ""mechanism"" is to just raise the blocksize further as was intended. The 8MB cap is just for ultra-cautionary purposes right now, then there is a harder 32MB cap, which can also be raised. This was the original plan. The idea that there is some special ""scaling mechanism"" needed is circular reasoning from the unstated premise that the original plan is somehow flawed.

That said, you make an important point: Bitcoin's value *is* still mainly speculative, and so it's still possible for investors to say something like, ""Well, obviously BCH proved Bitcoin *can* fork to bigger blocks, so any time we *really* need bigger blocks we can do that with a future fork of BTC."" 

The question is how far you can kill the actual existing commercial network effect that seems to be what provides the underlying basis for the speculation in the first place. With $10 fees that network effect has got to be pretty close to dying on places like the dark markets. 

It's again *possible*, though, that investors think something like, ""Well, the whole darknet thing proved that cryptocurrencies work. I'm sold on the idea. You don't actually need to keep using it for commerce now. We can do that later with bigger blocks or LN or whatever works. Let's just pile into the biggest, oldest ledger and wait 'til there's so much investment that the adults enter the room and kick out any idiot devs that may be playing 'big fish in little pond' right now, then we scale and take over the global economy."""
Best comment of the day for me. Take my upvote for making me lol.
OK, my account is older and I have the same opinion. What now? 
"That's the wrong user, the real founder of the platform is u/someguy123_ and not u/someguy123
If anyone is interested, the platform in the screenshot is called privex.io and is a virtual server provider that focuses on privacy and uses crypto as the only method of payment.
Also, u/someguy123_ is a popular litecoin dev"
Also consider housekeeping tasks like sending to cold storage.
"In the same way that BCH fixes this for maybe a year; if it sees mainstream adoption enough to matter, which... who knows. "
/u/someguy123_  would be happy to see his website being talked about on this sub!
Yeah if you send a few dollars.
Bingo!!! Logical and I have no idea what to actually support since I haven't checked post history 
Does your math take into account that people are not going to evenly spread out their transactions? People are more likely to have transactions en masse at particular times of day, e.g. around meals.
Since thebtransactions are not distributed evenly and most transactions take place during working hours the capacity should be far higher
In the mean time we could have just raised the block size and been in a better place right now.  Problem is all these carpet bagers who secretly want BTC to fail so their own coin which they own a ton of can take the mantle.  (ie: LTC and Charlie Lee)
"I like your analysis, but what happens if you also factor in increases in energy consumption and storage of the blockchain.

If either of these coins get used at visa levels, how long before distributed storage becomes an issue? "
the intended purpose is in the title of the satoshi white paper.  it realy is that simple
Bitcoin Cash has a current soft limit of 8 MB and a hard limit of 32 MB which is 224 tx/sec. The miners can configure to adjust up at any time. More than 32 MB will require a hard fork. However, testing has been done on 1 GB blocks e.g. visa levels and it works fine. So when necessary the chain will scale.
"> BTC is proving to be a better store of value / speculative asset because ~~""Bitcoin Cash"" is not ""Bitcoin"" if you go by block difficulty / adoption~~ it’s price went up.

Let’s not pretend this game of musical chairs is anything other than what it is."
Huh. When I do 1,000,000/24/60/60 I get 11.56. Where are you getting 700-some tps?
