"Hide my identity? You're an idiot. I've lived in Michigan my entire life and I started buying Bitcoin in 2016 so I could get giftcards at an 80% discount over at bitify.com 

I use the same name on Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and Instagram.

Sorry if it hurts your feelings when I say I don't think Satoshi has a vagina."
I'm pretty sure satoshi isn't a female either.
That’s clever, haha

"⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆

This applies to stickers/shirts/mugs/posters/etc...

This t-shirt spam is becoming an issue on Reddit. Often the accounts posting the shirt, those asking for a link and those offering the link are all involved. Usually newer accounts, often all three are the same age and have very low karma.

There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.

The broken English nonsense descriptions are also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertently hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.

Be careful, friends!"

Why not? If you were trying to hide your identity flipping the gender seems like a reasonable thing to do.
