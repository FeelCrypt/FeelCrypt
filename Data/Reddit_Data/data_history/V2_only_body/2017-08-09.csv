I'd say that you can't know it.

you seem to know everything mr lansing.
I'll stick with the most valuable and useful coin. 
you've never once responded to any of my technical points about LN.  do you even understand it?  this is getting boring talking to a paid troll shill.

Did you read the article he linked?
"> Yeah definitely just BTC

are you a rep for shapeshift?"

If you don't want any further split, does that mean if core says no to 2mb blocks, you'll just go along with whatever they say because you don't want to split the community even more?
How else can you expect to get larger block considering this environment?
Why should I? I'll wait and see until all facts are clear.
What if I told you there is no SegWit2X activation?
"At any given time, ""most valuable"" and ""most useful"" may not be the same coin.  Although, perhaps in the long run they will be."
And you'll be right where we were a month ago
I'd love to welcome you on Bitcoin Cash even if you continue full support for SegWit2X and even if it does come to pass.  Thanks for ShapeShift support.  Hoping to use it some day soon for a BCC buy.

Yes they still accept Bitcoin Settlement.
"Erik you were one of the first people I heard speak on the subject in early 2013 that made me realise how profound an invention Bitcoin was.  Thanks for building Shapeshift and everything else you have done.

Your decision to sell your BCH is honorable in the light of the NYA which I do hope creates a strong path forward for Bitcoin.  However I suspect, a bumpy road with those ideologically opposed to larger blocks.

If the way forward on the legacy fork ossifies as I fear it will, I am sure you will be welcome with open arms on the Bircoin Cash fork or whichever crypto steps into the void.

Very good point
Thank you. You had an extra slash there
"> But it doesn't surprise me that you misunderstand this. That seems to be a common theme with you.

what's funny is just about everyone considers you a troll here b/c you have nothing of value to say; just a bunch of ad homs against people when they call out your bullshit arguments.

"> mildly happy that Bitcoin Cash happened

I actually am mildly happy that it happened. I am looking toward November and SegWit2x. If that doesn't come to pass, I will probably look much more favorably at Bitcoin Cash."

Your interpretation is correct :)
I appreciate the kind comment. We'll see how SegWit2x goes.

"I did notice that you're defending the 2x deal to the best of your ability over at r/bitcoin, that's very honorable of you, however seeing the reactions, you are fighting a losing battle (not that r/bitcoin would be necessarily representative of BTC community as a whole, but still, it's a good&influential chunk of it).

But you may perhaps consider the point many are making - that Bitcoin Cash has obsoleted the need for that compromise, the community has already split and the Segwit2x compromise is not going to put it together anymore. Segwit proponents do not want 2x, big block supporters do not want SegWit and 2x is too little too late for them anyway - SegWit2x upsets both camps. It's perhaps better now that big blockers have split that everybody gets exactly what they want and let the market decide which one wins long term (or if they can coexist).

I obviously support Cash, I consider many individuals at the Core side plain toxic. Since the split, I registered substantial improvement in the atmosphere on this sub, people are joyful again, able to ignore the antics of people they vehemently disagree with, it reminds me of the early days. There are still plenty of jabs at Core but that's going to vane over time as we focus on future protocol and code improvements.

Bitcoin Cash is going to get the improvements that SegWit provides in due time, now that the most pressing issue of capacity is resolved. It just isn't going to be called SegWit and won't be a overcomplicated mess that SF SegWit is, it's going to be clean technically superior solution, perhaps FlexTrans or something else.

What I'm saying is, maybe you should seriously consider dropping he 2x part of the agreement and perhaps the crypto world will be better for it."
Myself and ShapeShift are fully committed to SegWit2x. We support SegWit, and we support conservatively larger blocks. Most importantly, we support anything that brings the feuding tribes together, because there are bigger fights to win ahead. 
Do you think the 2x part is likely to happen? A lot of people seem to hate it and the miners that supported it are likely to prefer Cash, right?
Fair enough.
Can this even be considered at overstock accepting it? I'd probably categorize this as ShapeShift accepting it because overstock is clearly only accepting Bitcoin if they instantly convert to it

I made like three different points in my comment.  You replied to none of them as usual.
It's too bad overstock.com puts like a 30% overhead on all their products compared to amazon.
