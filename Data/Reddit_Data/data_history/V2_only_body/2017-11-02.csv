Congratulations. Even after I sold big portion of it and buy BCC. I have to confess that I’m worrying about my mood in the future.  But this is what gambling tastes like. 
The other times, bitcoin was actually usable as a real currency. It's lost that since.
Why can't Bitcoin cause all alts to rise and still retain most of its value? Way farther down the line people can choose what they want with all the options available and it would be kind of a win-win situation.
"> Not the best tech wins, just the most popular

Not true. The **good enough** tech wins if it gains popularity. Darwinism. Currently legacy chain isn't good enough for everyday use, but have the inertia maybe for months to grow"
BTC is not just bad tech, it's broken unusable tech. 
"Yes, no one thinks about the first billion adopters. The soccer moms and Steel workers retirement fund. They don’t want the anarchist Bitcoin. They want the Fidelity Bitcoin. 

If that’s not what you folks want, be happy with a microcosm of a couple million people and a couple billion total cap. 

The moon means having most of the book of the month club in."
I don't think anyone is saying that BCH has been outperforming BTC.
Choo choo mada faka, hype mainstream is here.
What do you consider the fundamentals?
That's basically what I said.. 
Well, depending on how much confidence you need, even 3 or 5 confirmations might not be quite enough. My point here is that with Bitcoin Cash you have some reliability in zero-conf, which is enough for most cash-like transactions.
Dunno who downvoted you. Even Satoshi said 0 conf was unsafe, you can treat it like an indication you're going to receive the money, not a confirmation. 
">  it will be the same as btc and won't be able to count on being in the next block, correct?

The problem with BTC started to happen when blocks were ~80% full.  Due to variance in finding blocks, and rate of new transactions appearing, you started to see significant mem pool backlog and fee increases.

BCH currently allows 8 MB blocks, and the 80% point is 6.4 MB/block on average.  We are a good way from needing that.  As long as the size limit is increased in a timely fashion, we won't run into the capacity problem."
Oh, and Bitcoin Cash can actually handle 32 MB blocks, the 8MB figure is just a soft limit. Then when we have 32MB full block (and are therefore mooning), yes, another hard fork will be needed.
No, it’s a product of large blocks. Once the 8 MB blocks of Bitcoin Cash fill up, BCH will be handling more txs than PayPal, so it will be *huge*. And then we’ll increase blocks to 16 MB. Zero-conf will never stop working.
Bitcoin Cash has an 8MB blocksize limit currently, compared to Bitcoin's 1MB blocksize limit. So, if people all start using Bitcoin Cash instead, it will allow for 8 times greater usage before it hits the same problems. And Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the political issues that Bitcoin has so it can probably adopt future maintenance fixes more easily.
"No, most people buy stuff because they need it.

Most people buy oil to run their cars, to produce energy, or to make plastics. People trading oil are a minority.

People trading Bitcoin are the majority, that's the difference."
What do you mean fairly confident? It's almost 100%
It doesn't mean that everyone is acting like u. Question is how to measure economic activity. I didn't find a perfect tool to do it yet, but from my understanding it's far above 0%. U can look at merchants for start
Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dash are all better due to their lower fees and faster transactions.
Would you be likely to offer a discount to the customer willing to pay in money that is more likely to appreciate?
Those are two different currencies. The vendor will value the appreciating asset more and charge less for it. It works on both sides and the future expectations are baked into the price you pay. We all buy computers and phones even though we know we can wait a year and get it cheaper. 
I've been buying items with BTC since 2011/2012.
"You haven't heard ""Segwit is the root of all evil"" before?"
In itself I don't think it is the path to censorship, but using it as an excuse to restrict blocksize and artificially forcing transactions off-chain is.  Hence the 2X schism we are about to see.
It does hurt non Segwit tx as Segwit tx have a 75% discount - and fees are still magnitudes higher than BCH even with the discount
"Which wallets are defaulting to S2X as ""Bitcoin""?"
"They are both hard forks (mostly) related to block size disagreements... You're right about day 0 exchange support though, that does make it a little different.

"Eh, more like month trading. I don’t have enough money to day trade, and when I try to day trade I get too involved,  emotional, and lose money. If I sit back and “trust” the growth and what I “think” are patterns then I make a little money. I’m also interested in having some money in as it keeps growing and hopefully never tops out! 

Edit: For what it’s worth I should have set an alarm at 7 am this morning to wake up and get out when it was around 7,200. Now I’ve got to wait out my 40 buck investment until the next bull run. "
4am I assume? 
I want to do this too. But not coffee yet.

That is fairly confident.

"I can use the money in my bank to buy coffee.

If you're speculating, there is no reason to hold Bitcoin if you think the price is going down. Just cash it all out and buy in later. Some might hedge a bit but it wouldn't be enough to prevent a massive bubble collapse (we've seen Bitcoin do it before so there's no reason to believe underlying price support is high)"

Err BCH has been outperforming BTC over the last 24h and last 7 days??
"**Greater fool theory**

The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants. A price can be justified by a rational buyer under the belief that another party is willing to pay an even higher price. In other words, one may pay a price that seems ""foolishly"" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a ""greater fool"" later.

"> if it does it had been teken doen

Stop smoking whatever you're smoking."
I agree with you. All deflationary means is that people will be more careful with their spending rather than spending that inflationary funny money before it loses value (or alternatively throwing it into the stock market bubble). Better allocation of funds -> better economy.
"> Other cryptos are vastly superior in terms of their actual use. 

Which one?

Of course that's an effect."
"I don't do this because we are not at the coffee stage yet. We are at the ""securing the store of value"" stage."
I think merchants will make people want to come off of some of their BTC.
I haven't heard that argument. 
"Segwit gets a lot of hate, but the best argument I've heard against it is that it's overly complicated and might result in throwing out data you would rather keep.

It doesn't stop you from making normal non-segwit transactions, and I can't see how it would meaningfully compromise censorship resistance."
"I said wallets, not exchanges. Most exchanges give both I believe.

Besides, neither is Bitcoin yet, it could be 1x or 2x by the way of selecting Bitcoin as in the white paper (PoW)"
"Lol wut. The BCH split rejected Segwit, implemented an algorithm so that it would survive any period where the difficulty was too high, got rid of RBF, implemented replay protection, and increased the block size cap 8x.

All the Segwit2x split does is raise the block size cap by 2x (pitiful). There's also the fact that Coinbase/GDAX will let people trade the two coins from day 0. BCH didn't have that. And since neither chain has any sort of EDA, one chain very well could die should there be a lot of immediate economic support for one chain over the other."
Soon to be $9000 on non-Canadian exchanges :)
this.
Whoa. Wtf why would anyone trust that? Why wouldn't people funnel money from bitfinex or wherever into coinbase to be sold for actual dollars? 
Put it in Bitcoin so you can experience moon. Altcoins miss the point.
"BCH is one of the coins right now in outsider zone. Meaning no volatile ""market-maker"" trader would touch in the private zones. That means BCH has the price it will have in the worst case scenario because it only has the zealots behind it. True believers I'd say. Sure there is some speculation but right now speculators rape alts and BTC. BCH is probably at the ""will have a look later"" shelf.

Tether scam would affect all coins though because it undermines crypto stability. See the problem is cryptocurrency prices are not just code, not even tokens, they are also the whole infrastructure behind them. And if such vital infrastructure part as exchanges can get so conned you can bet your ass all crypto will hurt. That's actually a good way to attack cryptocurrencies while they are just rising. 10000 people hurt? (gox) not a global problem. 10000000 hurt? And you will see bans and laws against cryptocurrencies. People in the government are old and unfortunately not that understanding of technology, they have people to protect and if some part of infrastructure fails constantly leading to more and more casualties even if it promises peace and health to all the nation it will be banned and over-regulated (cue nuclear power). Look at how internet got overregulated in just 10 years? 10 years ago you wouldn't even imagine regulation of internet happening now, yet it is happening."
Common man has no knowledge of when to price in so common man won't risk it
Not really, though personally I think Tether is bullshit monopoly money, its a drop in the bucket compared to total volume globally.
"No it can't.  As I said, I can get my tx through on the next block and no one can stop me.

It's pathetic to watch people beg for there to be problems.  You're just a typical buttcoiner.  Meanwhile, I'm over here just using bitcoin as intended, purchasing products, contributing to the economy, making money, undermining central banks, and having fun.

Insignificant people like you can't stop us.  Bitcoin is a revolution.  Either be a part of it, or go away with your negativity."
BCH keeps going up faster so what's the problem?
4 what?
"This is a bullshit argument. I put something into bitcoin that I *specifically* took from my daily spending account.

Every time I spend, I think *wooho! Free money! I am still above my initial investment, and look at all the stuff I get*

Then, of course I have a savings bitcoin account too, just like I would with fiat. And then I have a medium-term savings account, of which I will spend (part of) the gains on my next vacation - at least if the gains are significant, which it looks like it will likely be.

We all use fiat. If you believe BTC should go up, why not buy a little bit more than you plan on investing for holding, and then spend from those?
"
😂 
Can be upped to 32MB via configuration files no hard fork, just network consensus.
"btc is what, about 4tx/s

Bch Max is = (btc x 8) = about 32 tx/s

A quick Google shows PayPal in 2011 was handling ~57 tx/s

I understand that hf to up the block size is a great option to keep zero conf transaction enable as we continue to grow, but let's not be disingenuous. That was the original point of my post."
Then you are not actually using it. And as you said you are using it every day, it makes you a liar.
Fee estimation is a bullshit strawman. Your cheap or even appropriately priced transaction can always get buried by a sudden increase in future demand. It is impossible to predict future demand, so you're always dependent on RBF or paying a premium until your transaction is confirmed.
I just think it’s underplaying an amazing feature of BCH.
Not sure what you mean when you say BTC should not care about politics. Obviously scaling is a major issue, and both Segwit and a block size increase are ways of dealing with it. How does Segwit have an unfair advantage just because it actually does deal with the scaling issue? It's cheaper than other TX, so that's good. And it's also good that if you don't like it, you can still ignore it. Block size will still need to be increased but that's a differen point (and I think the two things get mixed up on reddit way too often).
"> It means that the converse statement is true: using non Segwit transactions is 75% more expensive.

Why? That's a different statement. They are not more expensive than before, just in relation to Segwit. Segwit, however, *is* less expensive than before, not *just* in relation to non-Segwit. Non-Segwit TX are priced just the same, but now there is also a cheaper technology.

I'm not opposed to a block size increase at all by the way, even though I don't understand the strong sentiments against Segwit (besides that it delays a block size increase). And I agree about your statement regarding mass adoption."
"> We're butthurt because RBF and SegWit are complete garbage

How can you ever expect to have a real debate with someone when you talk like a 4 year old?  This isn't an argument.  Calling something ""garbage"" is just an immature opinion with no basis in reality.  Learn about the technologies, use them, test them, see what they can do, then criticize them like an intelligent adult with data and facts to back you up.  But if you just want to cry on the floor repeating whatever talking points Roger Ver fed to you this morning, then just go away.  You aren't contributing anything at all to this discussion.

> which percentage is bigger, 7%, or 12%? BCH had a bigger day. 

Lol at your cherry-picked stats.  One day of trading? Really?  That's what you're basing BCH's success on?  A single day?  Jesus christ this is funny."
I jumped on the XRP train , while ridding the bitcoin coaster. That is my good deed each month lol
"> no other main utility than just hodling

I disagree with your opinion.  It still retains all the utility that it did at launch (plus more).  I send value across borders without permission, trust, or reliance on any third party.

It's still a permissionless, trustless, decentralized, unstoppable value transfer system.

I don't know why you're going on and on about with the ponzi scheme talk.  You sound like a buttcoiner who is disgruntled about missing out."
Exactly this. Slow, expensive Bitcoin is not why I got hyped for it back in the day.
I am using it as a savings account.
"Yes, and my fees are fine for two reasons.  First, because I use segwit, which costs like 50% of non-segwit txs.  Second, because I always undercut the recommended fee.

Fee estimation is pretty bad in most wallets, and this is the main culprit in rising fees.  People don't realize they can go lower, so they just do what the app says.  This causes fee estimation software to continually increase fees for everyone.  But the reality is that you can undercut the recommended fee a lot and still get your tx confirmed pretty easily.

There are only like 19k tx in the mempool, and the average fee is like 13 sat/byte which is nothing."
"I agree. I think it is great progress in terms of tx/s potential. I just wanted to do a sample part to ensure genuine info/comments to be passed around.

To someone who may not understand that the block size is the reason that zero conf transaction can occur... They may assume it's a genuine coded feature, and not something that may stop working one day when blocks fill up (obviously fixed by forking to larger blocks)"
"Maybe so, but it is accurate. It is that ""almost"" that you also use to qualify that there is a chance that it won't be included in the next block. I'm pretty sure he would agree that almost certain is equivalent of fairly confident, at least in this case."
People who only look at the dollar value per coin are the cancer of cryptos and BTC. 
It drives fees up for non-segwit transactions, eliminating some use cases 
So you use a broken system as a saving account? Interesting. 
"1. It gives Segwit an advantage over other types of TX when BTC should t care about politics.

2. It kicks the can down the road. If usage climbs 4x in the next 12-24mo, Segwit tx will cost the same or more as normal fees now, wasting all that time we could have tried to fix it"
"> unstoppable value transfer system.

Wrong, it stops at 3 tps. "
">How can you ever expect to have a real debate with someone when you talk like a 4 year old?

Excuse me? You started out calling us ""butthurt""  you fucking sad hypocrite.

>Lol at your cherry-picked stats. One day of trading? Really? That's what you're basing BCH's success on? A single day? Jesus christ this is funny.

"
Right I can't stop you, only the flawed network. 
You can't stop me from making a payment.  That's unstoppable.
You said it is unstoppable. It stops at 3 tps. Full stop. 
"I never once disputed that.  You seem to have a reading comprehension problem.

I'm talking about individual incentives.  You're concerned with communist logic about what everyone can do or not do.

As an individual, you can get your tx in the next block by outbidding others with you fee.  This is the part that keeps going over your head."
"The network is limited at 3 tps.

Full stop. "
">There is no way to include more transactions than 3 tps. So if there is 10 tps demand, there is no way for 7 tps to be included in the next block no matter the fees you include

I didn't say anything like this. Perhaps calm down, take a deep breath, read what I wrote on more time, and try again."
"> it’s underplaying

I didn't read it like that.

> It’s over 99% certainty

That number is not based on statistics, is it? The chance is good, but but not accurately quantified. In that case ""fairly confident"" is leaving more room for uncertainty, without underplaying or making a potentially incorrect claim."
"I'm not sure you realize how capacity works. There is no way to include more transactions than 3 tps. So if there is 10 tps demand, **there is no way for 7 tps to be included in the next block no matter the fees you include**. 


So it stops at 3 tps. End of story. 
"
Does it matter? I do t think he’s anti BCH or anything. Just that it’s underplaying one of the majors benefits a bit. It’s over 99% certainty
This
"I can get my payment through whenever I want, despite how large the mempool is.

I'm not sure if you realize how bitcoin works, but there's a way to get your tx confirmed in the next block."
We obviously have different definitions of broken.
I use it daily to store my savings. I don't buy something with it every day.
I've seen him around. Would not think it was his intention. Maybe he'll clarify himself.
"Yes, 75% more in comparison to the cheaper option, that's exactly the point I'm making. The ""cheaper technology"" doesn't come from some genius innovation in ASIC computing that saves 75% electricity, it's an arbitrary hard coded variable that means nothing, it's basically a subsidy coded into the fabric of bitcoin. Adding subsidies into your system architecture means that to maintain equilibrium your standard tx over time *must* absorb the cost of that discount, seeing as no real productive capacity has been added to the system (especially not enough to pay a 75% margin) 

The sentiment comes from seeing the glaring technical failures and basic fumbles of even the most basic UX design fundementals, in addition to it's mathematical absurdity."
"You can actually probably ""fix"" Bitcoin pretty well by just sending people Bitstamp BTC IOUs on Ripple. I would take those for face value, and they send way faster."
Also no BCH has over 8x capacity, S2X has less than 8x, but it has a block weight max of 8000000. Doesn't mean u get 8x the tx in one block tho. Input and output size matters
"It means that the converse statement is true: using non Segwit transactions is 75% more expensive.

Besides, the ""moon moment"" of mass adoption can only take place on a chain with high tx capacity. Segwit/LN doesn't achieve meaningful scaling of the network, mainly due to the high failure rate of successfully routing a LN tx... Have you ever read their white paper or seen any of their presentations? The idea is hairbrain and asinine in every sense. The design requires users to share timelock keys and store passwords (huge ux burden) and even moreso, implicates users in a ridiculous rob-peter-to-pay-paul system of paying money forward as a way to route money for the system architecture. It's a total joke to think this network model will ever be useful to anyone, besides maybe a handful of extremely connected corporate hubs (crypto banking?) 

Of course the idiot self troll here is that crypto banking provides no selling point over regular banking and makes no sense for users. It's a non-product being formed in reaction to a disruptive technology, not a real activity of market force 

The selling point of crypto currency comes in that it is a ""private bank"" and empowers a user to function in a broader economic scope.

The only winning coin will be the one where the underlying technology can scale to mass adoption. 

BCH"
"> we have a thriving bitcoin economy either

How to improve it? Reduce fees by actual scaling"
"Well Bitcoin is ATH and its fees are ATH also.

This is in no way helping for merchant adoption."
"Sure, but it doesn' t mean we have a thriving bitcoin economy either.
Let's say you want to buy a flight ticket on expedia, is bitcoin easier/cheaper than using your credit card?.... nope

Merchant adoption is anemic"
Sure, most people buy things out of necessity. Doesn't mean the macro economy they're operating in isn't in a bubble. Low interest rates and fiscal stimulus have pushed a ton of markets way outside of sustainable growth. Look into The Everything Bubble.
"At this point I feel like I've just got stocks in Blockstream and I'm going to ride the hype until I turn it into real money (fiat or other crypto). 

It's not what I wanted for bitcoin and I believe others are superior, but <insert gif of Woody Harrelson crying into cash>"
"It's pretty funny, the times bitcoin is ""failing"" are the times it's most useful.

The times it's ""successful"" are the times it's not."
Bitcoin sucks out all of the capitalization from other coins during bull runs. 
Watch them say BETAMAX when that was arguably worse tech than VHS. 
And by good enough it might be completely bad. Just works as long as it reproduces. And in our case - popularity rises
It works fine. It chugs along at 7 TPS or whatever. It's just overpriced to send because everyone wants to send it.
"You guys are insane. There is nothing unusable about bitcoin. I use it everyday, as do lots of other people.

It works exactly as I want, and fulfills all the promises I signed up for.

I think you're just butthurt because BCH has been such a failure. "
"I thought the same thing when I read that.  I think of fundamentals as the buying demand as well as the growth in use and users.  The way I think of them, Bitcoin has never had stronger fundamentals.

If fundamentals means lowest fees, fastest blocks, and or newest fashionable tech specs, then you will believe that the most unused coins and newest coins always have the best fundamentals."
"the number of devs named ""deadalnix"" working on the crypto, clearly"
From my point of view it's a false reliability - level of safety in bitcoin cash for 0 confs is more or less the same like in bitcoin.
The spender doesn't care.... That risk will be baked into prices and business models.
Also, didn't realize it was a configuration change to allow 32 MB blocks. I thought it required a hard fork. So might not be as big a deal as I thought.
"Generalbytes just opened BCH support for their machines this week. 

It's pretty easy for existing BTC infrastructure to support BCH, since it's based on similar infrastructure.  Catching up is going to much easier for BCH for the simple reason that it's like BTC, except faster, cheaper, and more reliable.  "
Makes sense.
It would be interesting to hear from some of those companies how business is doing. I mean, I'm sure they're burning through money anyway but are they seeing more or less buying since fees went stupid?
"It's all actually a mind game. I realize that it easy to get trapped to think ""but...it's all going up! up! Better spend my fiat first"". But keeping my bitcoin in separate, dedicated accounts helps allowing me, mentally, to actually spend a little bit of my gains too, getting a small reward occationally."
and then the money flows back into alts between forks. While more money comes in to crypto, the support levels for these alts will undoubtedly increase. We have already seen it with the last fork although it was short lived.
"We're butthurt because RBF and SegWit are complete garbage that idiots held back real progress for 3 years to implement.

Id rather have $15,000 Bitcoin today on the original vision and tech than the $7000 we have today because Bitcoin lost so much ground to the rest of the  space in that time. 

You ""use"" bitcoin for what? Trading alts? Holding? You're certainly not buying anything from local merchants with it because credit card processors are offering a better price than BTC is for that service.

Yeah BCH is such a failure it was bulling up right along side BTC... which percentage is bigger, 7%, or 12%? BCH had a bigger day. 
"
"if you signed for buying something that has no other main utility than just hodling, and hoping greater fools are gonna want to hodl too, then you might want to revise the reason WHY you are investing.

Looking to make a fortune is not how it's done, you need to have passion, invest in the future you want to see (not just you being rich) and use your moral values to decide what is good in this world and needs your support. That's how you win long term, both financially and on moral values."
are you actually sending it from one wallet to another every day? if yes, how's the fees? if no then you're not using it.
You can't have 0 conf. with RBF...
yeah, someone needs to do some research one this. Having RBF and txs that can take 20, 30 blocks to confirm vs tx that always confirm on the next block for me gives a very different ground…
"Right, thanks for correcting my numbers :)

Doing more than half of what paypal was doing in 2011 is still a pretty amazing feat. Let's hope we get there soon!"
No you can change a configuration file to allow up to 32MB blocks.no hard fork. So PayPal levels at 32MB sounds feasible.
I guess, strange way to phrase it though. It’s almost mathematically certain.
Yes but with market knowledge and upcoming market volatility, i'd rather remove the discount temporarily and hold in a different currency.
Same here. The idea that no one will spend money if it's value only increases is silly. I still buy things I need and want, but I am much more conservative with my spending and there is nothing wrong with that.
I don't know if not getting a discount and/or being expensive counts as weakening censorship-resistance.
How does that hurt non Segmit TX? Genuinly wondering what your logic is. There's a discount for Segwit TX, but if you don't like using it you can just stay away.
Tender?
Ah yeah maybe. I guess because it was 9am here at the time that didn't occur to me.

Curious about this too
Okay. I'm trying to understand Bitcoin. If 1BTC=7,000 USD then what can you by with it where it doesn't seem like a rip-off? 2BTCs for one car doesn't seem like a fair deal either. I can break down $1,400 in to smaller fractions (1 or .25 or .10 etc) but how do I break Bitcoins down so I'm not paying 1 Bitcoin ($7,000) for a pack of muffins?
"USDT is the biggest shitty scam right here right now... I'm thinking GOX level of scam running there. They've seen GOX doing it and now think they can repeat it. 10K? We could see $60k if they continue faking it.

At some point it won't matter because of the mega margin long positions they have at real exchanges!

Imagine you have ""fake buys"" under control somewhere and you can long 10k bitcoins at $1k and sell them at $10k each with 10x margin, 100x margin? Guaranteed money out of nowhere. All you have to do is sell the fake tethers a bit above the market.

Gox taught people it's easy to manipulate an open worldwide market due to arbitrage"
No, you cannot and shouldnt rely on 0-confs. Even if there's no rbf in bcash, its still unsafe. Dont give people false sense of safety, someone can lose money because of that.
"What is this ""Tether scam"" you speak of?"
that's sound like so old news now haha
South Korea has always been the most important country in crypto for the past 5 years. Bithumb is usually the exchange with most volume for years now. Nothing unusual if you know that South Koreans are the nation with widest adoption of cryptos.
Fuck.
Thanks for your concern
"Bitcoin can be broken down just like regular currency. 1 bitcoin is much like 1 pound or dollar, just like how due to exchange rates, $1 can be exchanged for €1.4; 1 BTc can be exchanged for $7000. 

Similarly, bitcoin can be broken down into smaller percentages, which are then worth less than an entire bitcoin, much like smaller denominations of currency such as pennies and cents. These are then used to pay for less expensive items. So, you could then use 0.001 btc to pay for a less expensive item."
You’re retarded, here I’ll trade you TWO-HUNDRED (yes two hundred)  pennies for ONE car. 200 > 1 
Cant stop it..!!
"On BCH split and BTG split BTC price immediately dropped. It didn't take long to recover and head back to new highs. But it did drop initially.

It's important to note that BCH and BTG were valued far lower from the get go. By contrast BT2 is trading at $1000. It's not too far fetched to see $1k suddenly get shaved off the price of BTC at time of fork.

What happens after that is anybodies guess. But I'm not so sure it just repeated the pattern we saw with BTG and BCH. Those were clear minority hard forks. B2X is more legitimized and will likley be a majority hard fork. It'll be interesting to see how the market reacts to this changing circumstance. "
*“Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”* -- Warren Buffett
Wallets won't default as clearly to the Core chain as they did with Bitcoin Cash though. I doubt it's as comaprable and predictable as you say
You can't base it off what happened with the BCH split at all. This one is very different.
much, much higher
we had 7324 at cb before a fall to 6751, now working its way back up. seems 10k may come a lot sooner. nuts.
Keep going up 
I kinda doubt Buffet said that about cryptos...
It’s hard to tell if HODLers are feeling more greedy or fearful at these levels.
"> we might see 10k this month 

This month there is a contentious HF.. but yeah let's forget about that! 10K!

It's a one-time fee. You buy and hodl. You don't use BTC to buy coffee every day. 
"> Other crypto currencies are superior.

No they are not and Bitcoin has one huge advantage, the network effect.

And I understand the run very well, it's the anticipation of the SW2X fork. Which is wanted by almost everybody with more than half a brain cell."
It's all being left on exchanges. Hardly anyone is using it or has control of their keys. Expect another disaster soon.
I sold 75% of my BTC holdings over the years for ETH, XRM, and others. At first I did a lot of hand wringing watching the charts, but then I realized that I cannot predict the market so there is nothing to regret. I have, on average, made more money than if I were to hold BTC alone. Diversify and you will be rewarded and, at the very least, will minimize your chances of losing everything to one coin that flopped.
Because 99% of all crypto users, don't actually use Crypto for anything but speculation. It's all about the network effect at this point. The tech is not as important.
Bitcoin cash increase to 500+, ratio wise it did increase even more than Bitcoin Core.
The market understands though. For a liquid store of value, speed and Tx fees are irrelevant (within reasonable limits, of course).
If institutions start to outbid each other, we might see 10k this month never mind this year.... 
"Well BTC is in full speculative mode..

A shame really because high BTC prices does nothing for cryptocurrencies adoption.."
"Bitcoin is in a major bull run and a gateway for FIAT into other crypto. 
Also I think a lot of people (myself included) keep bitcoin/fiat on exchanges, few people use it to buy stuff. Most hold it and hope to sell later for profit..."
It may not be the best coin technologically (and neither is Bitcoin Cash for that matter), but that's not the only basis people use when deciding on what to invest in or use.  It has value because a large enough number of people agree on the idea that it has value.  I don't know if I would call that dumb money or not, but it's money either way.
Bitcoin Cash is also slow nowadays. Had to wait 3 hours for a single transaction. Ethereum on the other hand completed one of my transaction in 2 minutes. Not picking sides, but just my experience.
"People (most of ""real people"", not us on Reddit...) doesn't uses crypto-currency as a currency, but as a financial (speculative) instrument, in particular the Bitcoin owners are all holders: they are waiting the day it goes mainstream, to fill their wallets with 1 BTC = $50000. Basically the Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of the gold.

Considering the above, the technology is not relevant... it WILL be relevant: when everyone and their puppies will be ready to use it as coin, for that day it will change to suit the new necessity. For now the consolidate name is the only thing that counts."
Based on the last split for Bitcoin Cash, absolutely nothing. B1X will continue to rise initially, B2X's fate is unclear. This is due to the mass majority of buyers being non-reddit users who have no clue what the politics of these coins are nor what Bitcoin Cash is
Hmm, I predicted $10k by 2022, seems I was wrong.  It will be higher.

It's because you don't understand what Bitcoin is. It's not about being slow or high fees. It's about a censorship resistant community to store your wealth. It's digital gold. I don't care if it cost me $25 and takes 3 days to confirm. I care that my dollar has lost 95% of the value in the past hundred years. And Bitcoin is going up. 
Some of us see bitcoin as a store of value while atomic swap compatible coins like litecoin and vertcoin will be like “spendable bitcoin”

One must ask themselves the question. Is the market wrong? Or just you?
because nothing has been changed in adoption. It's just FOMO.

2x has no replay protection. If it gains majority hash rate it will violently kill the 1x chain 
when it is explained like this, i have to admit it sounds like a bubble, when will it explode? when everyone cash it at the same time (or almost at the same time)
Good post. First a censorship resistant store of value. Once we have that, then spendability is just gravy after a certain point.
So,  if I had 1000 BTC (I don't),  how hard would it be to trade it for 7 mill cash?   Can i just process and exchange like I would Canadian dollars to American?

Obviously the entire market will shit itself and BCH included, but do you think it's fundamentally stronger than BTC with regard the obvious pump we are seeing?

Just looking for an opinion..."
"There's a company who issue ""crypto-dollars"" and calls them USD Tethers, and the ticket symbol is USDT. They claim that they issue USDT only when someone deposits USD and they issue the same amount of USDT... Exchanges like USDT, because it's technically not US dollars, but some crypto with fixed exchange rate to the US dollar... If they are using USD - they would have to follow other regulations and worry how to accept USD deposits and process USD withdrawals....Once USDT becomes available in exchanges - many traders like to park their cash in USDT when they are not sure how an expected event will affect the crypto-market , and just don't want to hold any crypto for some short period.
There are basically few problems:  more than 450 million USDT are issued from the start of the year, the company who creates USDT does not exchange USDT into USD, so basically it's just a token that can be traded on exchanges, but you can never cash it out in USD, but only exchange it for other crypto.  You have to trust the company that they really received USD before they issue USDT, and that they didn't create new USDT from nothing.... USDT is most heavily used on an exchange which has questionable reputation - Bitfinex.. If you hold USDT - you are not sure what you are holding, because the company who issued USDT will not exchange it to USD, and your only option is to find someone who will trade their crypto for your USDT."

Thank you for your explanation. What's the whole $7,000 about? Is that how much it is on the stock market?
Well OK. But I think BCH has a much better risk/reward potential right now than BTC.
amount is irrelevant, it's about % increase.
we are now on that world stage. We got the attention we needed. Prepare for an influx of new users and adopters .
HODLers play the long game. No reason to fear anything short-term. 
We HODLers celebrate the increase of value of financial freedom. Fuck the government, fuck taxes!
It's over $9000 on Canadian exchanges. Feels surreal.
I'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next hour...
It's literally the exact same thing... Over the exact same issue...
And while it is still far from perfect, at least you can be fairly confident your transaction will get included in the next block. Get it wrong with BTC and there's no telling how long you'll have to wait.
i am beginning to think we may se 10 000 this side of new year
"By the same logic sellers would never sell things in inflationary currency because they can always sell them for more tomorrow.  

In reality it depends on how deflationary it is. Rapid deflation puts a lot of pressure for people to not buy things with it, but rapid deflation of bitcoin can't last forever.  You can't have one bitcoin have more value than the entire economy so there is a limit.  

With rapid inflation, the eventual limit is the money goes to zero, and sellers won't sell anything for the cash because it is worthless."
There's a liquor store near me that accepts Bitcoin.
"It can be both; at some valuation it will stabilize. Its not going to replace fiat outright. "
Probably.. however it depends of how the technology will evolve.
Watching the way everything is behaving I tend to agree. I'm trying to hold out until 4, but I'm finally getting tired. Might just call it.
That’s where we strongly disagree. Bitcoin was created to be a cash system. With Bitcoin having strong market adoption and super low fees, I don’t see why people would still use inflationary coins at all...
"There's no reason to cash out (as you won't cash out all your money from your bank for no reason).

Surely, if the day the mass is prepared to use a crypto-currency as they are using today their money, the Bitcoin (and its infrastructure) wouldn't be ready to be used that way, then yes, all the holders will move to something else and it will turn into a exploding bubble.

Luckily this world is evolving everyday, so we don't know which technology will be adopted for that day... it could be in the next 2 years.. or 4 years.. or whenever it will, it's very hard to predict how the Bitcoin will change by then."
"You can't store value with something useless. Bitcoin has no primary use other than as a currency from which to derive its value. If people hoard Bitcoins, and then Bitcoin becomes useless as money, then they'll all be propping up a bubble that could burst at any time.

I don't understand it. Bitcoin keeps rising but Bitcoin is still slow and high fees. Other crypto currencies are superior. Is it so much dumb money flowing in?
Huh? BCH didn't touch 1x at all did it? It even reached an ATH that week? Don't believe BTG touched it either. Where are your figures from?
"Are there any exchanges not defaulting initially to what you are calling ""the Core chain"" (a.k.a Bitcoin)?

How will the split affect this steady increase?
You don't do this because btc become to expensive to users forever coffee. 
So basically just market manipulation?
"Other cryptos are vastly superior in terms of their actual use. Bitcoin is simply more successful because it has first mover advantage.

Also I do not think it's the anticipation of the fork at all. I think this is just more and more people coming into crypto as it keeps rising. If every month you're hearing news about bitcoin breaking the all time high again, they're bound to buy it eventually. I have seen a very large increase in the interest my friends have in Bitcoin, and I don't think that's a coincidence."
Some are hodling with the intention of spending the coins.
">Bitcoin is in a major bull run and a gateway for FIAT into other crypto. 

Yes but this run appears to be a gateway for fiat OUT of other crypto back to fiat. All alts are down."

I'm not sure if we run out of them sometime soon...

Big block miners are mining BTC and buying BCH. By mining BTC now they are pushing up its difficulty in time for the fork.

"""can someone explain why Bitcoin is so high? It doesn't make sense to me"" 

""lmao what a dumbass, who the fuck asks questions about Bitcoin in a Bitcoin subreddit? And why should I explain it when I can be condescending instead?"" "
Your definition means Bitcoin is extremely centralized because if people just use it to cash outb for Friday later, them they are as weak as exchanges
In the battle between legacy chain and Bitcoin Cash, can we all maybe at least agree, fuck Ripple??
It’s digital gold and in its current state it’s just as useful for exchange as gold. So if it’s digital gold I think s relevant follow up is how many solid gold bars and coins you hold and whether you’re just as excited about the prospects of your gold appreciating in value? And then another follow up is why bother with bitcoin if it’s no better than “digital gold” and gold is better understood and more widely accepted. If it’s gold with a weaker network than physical gold why bother?
"BCH is central controled money , BTC is not he blockstream lie most people believe here is a lie , blockstream does not matter if it does it had been teken doen by the CIA/FBI/NSA  bitcoin is CENSORSHIP RESISTANT.

"
This is the opposite of the truth.
Not really,   It actually hit 7000 USDT , which may seem the same as $ today, but there will be time when the Tether scam fails and people understand that USDT is not the same as $
By secure you mean higher has h rate?
"Let’s be serious. Fees will go up as small blockers planned and that would render doing so useless. 

Once this “fee market” is created by constraining block capacity, you’ll be looking at much higher fees to establish or close channels. These two things are simply contradictory to each other. 

Off chain scaling means higher fees which nearly FORCES a need for the off chain solution because only exchanges will be able to absorb the exorbitant fees needed to be included in these tiny blocks. 

There are people out there pushing 256kb blocks... "
"You cannot be seriously suggesting that even in a perfect scenario for Bitcoin, a ""thing"" that 99,99% of population only know from it's bubble/speculative investing or the silk road and drug sales, or do not know at all, would genuinely compete with a thing that is literally offered by a ""trustworthy"" company that is the developer of their chosen mobile platform?

Being positive is good and all but come on.

Bitcoin adoption did not halt due to fee increase. Not for most, if none. Sure, it definitely did not help, but blaming it as the catalyst is short sighted. Fact of the matter is that it simply isn't very useful for a company to offer bitcoin payments, and while the initial boom was due to trialing it being relatively easy and inexpensive thing, the actual amount of actual customers that use it is generally very very small. Infact I work for a company that trialed Bitcoin in 2015 and tried supporting it, but it was simply a money sink, albeit rather small."
"I'm not understanding how this works. If they (wallets that dont downkoad the whole blockchain) work without any changes, what's the talk about replay attacks""? Doesn't this mean every transaction will be automatically broadcast to both current and 2x chains? I was under the impression my existing wallet (say, Mycellium or Coinomi) would talk to the current segwit chain, and I would need to do something fancy to use s2x chain... much like how I had to make a bitcoin cash wallet and use the prior seed to access it."
plenty of alt coins existed with cheap fees and quick transactions before either of those and the still didn't compete.  It is simply to clunky for the average user.  I mean, how easy is it to use Apple Pay etc.  and even those have abysmal adoption rates.  At the moment the 'killer app' for block chain is as 'an easily transferable store of value/wealth held on a distributed decentralised immutable blockchain/ledger'.  Which only bitcoin fulfills at the moment.
"""Cripple bitcoin so that businesses can't use it and are forced to 2nd layer solutions instead""

That's if we have all the required info. There are also allegations of banking groups having investments in Blockstream, so it could just be ""cripple the whole thing to death"""
The point is that they don't want you to be having respectful discussions backed up with facts. It censorship plain and simple.
Yes, that's a good point, my last thought was kinda silly. 
"Good point, but botnets can be fought, and its easy to detect an abnormal CPU usage.  Hopefully it will be an additional incentive for programmers to make their programs more secure.

> an i9 that you can easily resell

In the long run you wont be able to easily resell your used mining hardware.  Yes, back in the day where GPU mining was a thing you did not have to mine much to be profitable, and thus your GPU was not that used and could be sold at a decent price.  But over the years mining margins are supposed decrease down to a point where competition is so rude that hardware must be used almost up to the breaking point before being profitable.  We are not there, but in the long run we should.

Now that I think of it, such GPU/CPU mining scheme probably cannot exist in practice: CPUs/GPUs are just too complex and some day or another optimizations will be found and mining will become ""professionalized"" once again.  So I guess I was wrong and the mining scheme does not really makes such a difference.

Yes, privately, they can take advantage, but then they also have to admit (to themselves) that their day job is a scam (or live with the cognitive dissonance).
"It'll be ""heard"" automatically by the miners working the chain with the most accumulated PoW. It would have to be replayed to the other chain (whichever that is)."
Very revealing information! I read all of that wikipedia page and it reveals a lot.
What are your thoughts on the Censorship in your sub? And are the other mods open about their desire for censorship?
that one is honest. 
Because they think the second one would be as effective as they need it to be, once they decide to use it. No need for the former, way easier to just profit from it in the meantime.
"But one route is easy and effective and one route is expensive, convoluted, and questionably effective. I think you're way overestimating the esteem and concern such people have for Bitcoin.

Rich bankers stand to profit just as much or more than the average person from bitcoin's *success*."
"Hmm. So if I do a bitcoin segwit chain transaction post fork, it will automatically be heard by miners working on both chains? I thought someone would have to record it, and re-play it to the other chain's miners.. hence ""replay""."
"Crypto is a hydra, which is readily apparent to anyone with the foresight and interest to have already been well versed in crypto since before Blockstream's creation. Crippling Bitcoin through investing in a single firm that has *some* (not even a majority or the lead maintainer) core developers as a means to ""cripple the whole thing to death"" is a very slow, expensive, inefficient means of trying to stop cryptocurrencies from growing and spreading.

Want to stop crypto as a bank? Make it illegal. Lobby, lobby, lobby. It wouldn't even be hard, it's strange and hard to understand, only nerds use it, and there are people getting rich that *aren't you* as a decision maker. Add in terrorism and CP or whatever else you need and it would be easy to ""ban"" it as a WAY more effective medium term solution to stopping it. That may still happen. This alternative ""invest and corrupt a single instance from the inside"" is a conspiracy theory that has never made sense to me."

"Bitcoin was getting adopted by mechants for payment at a great rate before the fees skyrocketed when the 1mb limit was reached., Then it all collapsed which left a sour taste in late adopter's mouths. Alts were not known or trusted by the general public.

The infrastructure and streamlining to allow the average joe easier adoption was making good headway right when the early adopters were asking stores to accept BTC, then it all collapsed to store of wealth system, care of blockedupcore. It essentially set the whole growth and adoption back to the first days. Because it takes great time to gain general public trust and knowledge of the tech. BTC was far ahead and lost it all to alts that are slowly gaining but they are basically starting from scratch on general public trust.

Yes, agree the tech is clunky and confusing for the average joe. BTC was gaining on both those fronts, and then essentially gave up that potential.

I never said BTC would be competing with credit/debt cards right now, but it would probably be competing with apple/android pay, which while still small are growing in adoption by leaps and bounds with millennials.

As for ecoins, everyone is waiting to see what will be the next leader in adoption as it looks like BTC legacy looks to be slowly getting replaced as it's share of the pie is dwindling. Yeah is a decent store of value now, but things can and will change rapidly, once a new clear leader is chosen by the general public."
"I did not say adoption stopped. Its use changed though, that's for sure, it became too expensive for small purchase use.

And yes it was becoming used for legal purchases until the 1mb limit was reached.

The amount of people using apple/android pay is small too, are you not proof reading well or what? How many times do i have to repeat myself?
"
And there's also people out there pushing for 2 MB blocks and LN. 
"Some vocabulary: A replay attack can occur when your data is valid on two or more networks. If you use network A to send some crypto to your friend Charles and that same transaction would be valid without needing to change it in any way on network B, you can be the subject of a replay attack, where a third party takes a copy of your transaction on A and rebroadcasts it to network B.

This was a concern at the BCH fork because BCH expected to be a minority chain for a non-zero amount of time and wanted to reassure its users that using their coins would not open them up to losses on the BTC network (and vice versa). In order to prevent replay attacks, BCH changed the format that is accepted as valid for transactions, making any software written for BTC incompatible with BCH.

Because S2X is intended to be an  upgrade to the BTC network, they have not implemented replay protection. S2X expects to be **the** BTC network on fork day and expects that the 1MB chain will be completely deprecated, making replays irrelevant. The benefit of this approach for most users is that they have to do absolutely nothing to benefit from the increased capacity."
No problem, take your time.
They were almost single handedly   responsible for activating Segwit on Litecoin.
Can you open up the mod logs at least and show what's going on?
He already got shuffled from #2 down to the bottom when there were rumors of an attempt to get Theymos removed.
My point is, they're not mining the transactions. They are even bashing 2x, seems like a pool that deserves to be shunned by Core & /r/Bitcoin, not praised. Even Antpool is mining SW transactions, and they hate them. The hypocrisy (ignorance?) of Core supporters & r/bitcoin is at insane levels.
"Clap, Clap! +1

Yesss sir, you get it! Very glad more people are seeing this for what it is. 

Makes the whole ""2x ***debate***"" seem pretty stupid hey, when everyone should have been up in arms over SEGWIT1. The trojan horse always was 2x. And by saying it would be committed months after Segwit went live, allowed them to backtrack on 2x (as we all said they would!). They already got what they want (Segwit1). As predicted, they then attacked 2x as some rouge change that hurts Bitcoin. The ONLY difference is the block size increase... How the heck is that a problem in comparison to Segwit itself? L1 scaling is a problem to them, but developing NEW software (l2) to accomplish an L1 job, is okay??? Pure insanity that most of the community was to be persuaded by something that has more holes than a block of swiss cheese. 

Good post!"
I always had the feeling that fees were a mistake to begin with: it gives incentive to miners to make everything they can to increase fees.  Yes in one hundred years fees will work because there will be no more block reward, but other solutions exist.  For instance block reward could stay constant past a certain point, something like 10 satoshi after 90 years, or fees could be activated *only* when the block reward drops to 0.
"SPV wallets work on 2x without any changes. The upgrade is invisible to them. They can send and receive payments and verify that a given transaction has been confirmed in exactly the same way they do now.

The big thing here is the exchanges taking sides by what they decide to do with the upgrade."
"What blows my mind is how idiotic Core was for not adopting the Hong Kong agreement. They could have come off as reasonable people, solidified their influence on the direction of Bitcoin, kept blocks small-ish, adopted SegWit with a cleaner hard-fork, and not caused 3 competing coins to exist.

That they drew this arbitrary hard line at 1mb and fostered this multi-year argument defending that line at all costs, demonstrates glaring strategic incompetence in my opinion."
">The fundamental problem with this is in Bitcoins quest to become a store of value. It’s fairly obvious that the protocol itself, as a payment method, is dead in the water. 

LN doesn't hamper your ability to store Bitcoin akin to gold. You wouldn't use LN for your hodlings. You'd have it already settled onchain in cold storage. LN is the type of thing where as you said between exchanges hot wallet (they'd still keep cold storage that is of onchain funds), but also if you just want to buy a coffee and things like that then you might lock up $100 or so in a payment channel and you use that for your cheap day to day LN transactions."
"Indeed, we must not ignore the fact that a $76'000'000 startup almost succeeded to destroy Bitcoin.  I'm convinced that eventually a crypto-currency will rule out fiat money at some point, but Bitcoin proved to be quite weak when under attack.  I think fees are really playing against Bitcoin because it gives incentives to miners to cripple the blockchain to artificially increase fees.  

I also think that SHA256 as a proof of work was not the best choice, because it favorise professional mining too much, and therefor makes mining centralized and quite prone to attacks.  Another proof of work scheme based on something much more ASIC resistant would have been better.  Ideally a proof of work were the ""best ASIC"" for is a GPU or even a CPU.  Anyway..."
Uhuh. Maybe not necessarily SegWit, but the enabling of Blockstream's business plan, for which that was prerequisite.
Hopefully never. I hope the miners abandon Bitcoin for Bitcoin cash after the next adjustment
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

If in 2 years Blockstream did start a competing project people could switch to bitcoin cash instantly. Right? What am I missing?
"But we don't have to use sidechains if we don't want to, so that's that.

With 2X, BCH, and all the nonsense, they don't want the users to have a choice. They want you to do as much as possible on chain so they can get the fees. They don't give a rat's ass about normal folks being able to run a node. They don't give a rat's ass about censorship resistance because they want to be in control rather than users.

All you have to do is extrapolate Visa figures and see that we must go off chain. People who don't understand this will be a victim of the money grab by the BCH and 2X centralists as they miss the moon.

Hi Scott_WWS,
This message is to inform you that your recent post was silently removed by the moderators of /r/Bitcoin. It will appear for you at that link, but not if you are logged out. This is usually done because they wish to strictly control the narrative for Bitcoin, so that they can decide its future.
You are not alone; /r/Bitcoin has removed at least 360 other items in the last 24 hours.
If, like us, you don't like others deciding what can be discussed, feel free to check into one of these fine subreddits which do not attempt to control their discussions: /r/BitcoinMarkets, /r/btc, /r/BitcoinBeginners, /r/CryptoCurrency"

"It’s an echochamber. 

The vast majority in that subreddit are unable to think for themselves and just repeat whatever they see developers write. Theres no clear ideology there, just copy and paste of FUD related to small blocks. 

It tends to be the reddit gateway for new BTC enthusiasts and as such, the honeymoon period lends to a very sheepish atmosphere. Theyre excited to be a part of this. Thats great, but in their excitement it seems that supporting anything developers say is perceived as positive for credibility. 

In short, people in that subreddit think it makes you a “real” Bitcoin “early adopter” if you support the Core developer collective and anything against miners, business, and on chain scaling. "

Dealing with these issues requires market participants to maintain multiple balances and accounts across the market to avoid ISL, increasing overall capital requirements and exposure to the possibility of counterparty risk."""

"In all fairness LN doesn't directly benefit Blockstream as anyone can run their on LND node and be a LN payment hub and act as a competitor to Blockstream.

Hampering the ability to use onchain solutions at all costs of course increases the need for off chain solutions and that's where Blockstream comes in. They want to force you to have to use a off chain solution of which they provide and transform Bitcoin not into a payment network but solely the issuer of currency and force you to have to use a solution like their propitiatory side chains to fulfill payments. This is dangerous because then the unit of payment becomes too detached form the Bitcoin network."
No, BCH is the lesser of these evils. No SegWit and 8mb blocks. Satoshi's Bitcoin.

Are you able to determine who banned me exactly, and why?  I literally had not said anything more inflammatory than I usually do (which means I was politely disagreeing), and BashCo and I have been on good terms for months.  I also have spoken privately with Greg Maxwell about the ongoing debate and both of us were totally respectful to eachother.  Kind even.  It really caught me by surprise and I have been ignored when I asked for reconsideration / unbanning.
"Right. I guess the funny thing is that Bitcoin is fundamentally a mix of collective cartel rules (like the block size limit or the coin limit) plus individual freedom to act for each miner as well.

I can also well see the *miners* collectively limiting block size further down the road (though not now or even soon), to extract just a little bit more money from being a Bitcoin and not an Altcoin miner.

Looking forward to BIP100 or so soon."

Meeeh.. that can only last for a year top, and I think I'm being generous. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a good thing for BCH.

"At the same time, theres this perception that LN will be regularly used by two individuals. In reality, exchanges, wallets, and other larger entities will establish LN channels between each other. The transactions you do within those exchanges will be settled between each other via those same large payment channels, much like how todays banks work without the 3-5 business day delay. Think Bittrex <-> GDAX, not Sally to John. 

The fundamental problem with this is in Bitcoins quest to become a store of value. It’s fairly obvious that the protocol itself, as a payment method, is dead in the water. Gold is stored in vaults, protected because people need to know it’s secure in the case the world economy collapses. The gold holder can physically verify that they are “secure” in the case currencies collapse by simply seeing or touching gold. Gold is always gold even when broken down to its smallest form. If you don’t actually control the storage / movement of “your” Bitcoin, are you truly in a position to use IT if some shit goes down? With LN, no. 

I, however, am in favor of certain implementations of LN for other reasons. "

The truth shall set you free.
This will likely be a continuous problem even if Blockstream goes away. Every strong coin will attract people trying to profit with it by taking control.  We depend on good natured and high functioning developers to maintain the developments in a way that protects the coin from bad actors.

What should be stickied?
This is because segwit is meant to facilitate the siphoning/stealing of tx's fees to offchain providers, like LN hubs or sidechain federated servers. 
I certainly will.
Keep mining segwit until the difficulty increase. The increase ensures bch has a very good position after the fork
Lower reward reduces profits
So, what you are saying is they prefer to maintain the status quo, to keep the monopoly on the fee market
">>I like the idea of segregation in order to compact the block to make it smaller, it's the ""smarter"" 
>
>Explain how segwit does this? It doesn't. It just gives a fee discount for the segregated section so when the backlogs get high people are incentivized to use it.

I like the idea of segregation, but not segwit implementation of the idea.

There could be a lot of ways to segregate the block and extract common information for sake of compression, segwit is not the right way to do it "
Logic much? How is the discount also not a centrally determined subsidy to SW outputs used for LN payment channels via p2sh multisig? 
People are already incentivised to use it but they still don't even take the discount because it's useless garbage chain ruining technical debt and I'm so glad bitcoin cash exists without segwit.
Because the 75% was centrally determined by pwuille and Greg to the benefit of Blockstream products. 
A fee market inherently can't work because it's impossible to predict what a sufficient fee is.
"Think about what happens when the block reward runs out in the future.

Think about what happens if it becomes more profitable to set up an LN hub than to mine?

Sidechains through Segwit do not consider the fact that there needs to be economic incentive to secure the blockchain (ie. mine). Without that incentive the whole economic model is out of whack."
"They're talking about lightning network; in which all user fees go to hub operators, who then decides what to pay the miners on the bitcoin network.

Over time, the bitcoin block reward subsidy reaches 0, and if we move our transactions fees to 2nd layer before then without providing for an alternative income stream for the 1st layer miners, we'll be out of a 1st layer and the 2nd layer will collapse on itself.

Bitcoin Core have yet to address this long-term vision in a to me adequate manner."
If they code it so in chain fees are ridiculous, there is no competition.
"Oh, right. They're listed under 25th dated people, not 24th.
Well, then they only signed to activate it, not to support it after it's inception."
If the block size is capped, it is not a fair fee market between offchain an onchain, right?
If it was a good idea they wouldn't have needed to use censorship, propaganda, disinformation efforts, and a hardcoded discount.
"> Enabling commerce and the fees it generates is very much within the purpose of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is about disintermediation, not generating fees. Fees are a necessary evil, not evidence of commerce."
"I don't know, when you factor in the exchange costs, the time lag costs, the opportunity cost of the increase in BCH price, and the opportunity cost of having BCH be a more secure network, not to mention the kudos for supporting the network you truly believe in, while weakening the one you don't, it would be a lot closer.

Having said that, maybe they just want to keep making profit on BTC while speculating on BCH, and I suppose that is up to them. "

Because in the long run slow confirms and high fees will push usage to other chains, that may not be sha256 or even PoW.

"The NYA agreement stated the network would be upgraded with Segwit at the beginning of August and then with a 2Mb block size increase 3 months later.

> So... if they break the NYA and mine BCH then let's praise them but if they break NYA and mine Bitcoin Boooooo Boooo, bad miners bad!

Here's your attempt to label people hypocritical for praising miners for mining BCH and yet complain when they mine Segwit1X.

You are correct that if miners mine Segwit1X they are breaking the NYA by going against the 2Mb upgrade but they certainly aren't breaking the agreement by mining BCH. BCH forked before the NYA was implemented and is a completely separate coin. If miners want to mine another coin other than BTC they have ever right. Therefore your attempt to call people out for being hypocritical is plain wrong.

If that hasn't cleared it up I doubt any amount of back & forth will...and since your first port of call in a discussion is to revert to crude insults, it's plain to see you're not capable of rational dialogue anyway, so I will make that my last reply."
You don’t understand the test. It doesn’t prove that 1 gb blocks can propagate with issue. It just means that they ran one successful test. Just think it would take quite some time to download a 1 gb block coming from China in the meantime they are already mining the next block.

Large blocks can apparently propagate, and with 0 conf (no RBF) transactions are instant with 10 minutes between confirmations.

"A lot of people update quickly after a release, like me, so there will definitely be a jump this week (although I don't know what percentage of Bitcoin users use Electrum) 
But yes, many people will also take a while to update. "
Maybe they are not assuming BTC will grow more and or faster than BCH.  
" > So... if they break the NYA and mine BCH

Bitcoin Cash is a forked coin and has nothing to do with the NYA, therefore miners are not breaking the NYA by mining it. It's a pretty simple concept to understand...take your time.
"
"LN would in theory allow bitcoin to scale and reach a wide audience. However, certain transactions would still need to be settled on chain. This is an attempt to keep the blockchain modestly small, fees the same (if we scaled with big blocks vs small blocks + off chain), allow instant transactions, and keep bitcoin decentralized. The bad part is that we don't know how off chain transactions will work and if they can be as useful as on chain. The bad part about using big blocks is that nodes SHOULD become very expensive and not for home use, no instant transactions, super large blocks will have a hard time propagating through the network (we don't know how this will play out), and possibly less decentralization since poor countries shouldn't be able to afford running full nodes... 

Basically less tx on chain = higher fees per tx vs way more tx on chain = way less in fees. If you had to pay $100 up front to perform 1000 tx or pay $.1 for each 1000 tx you needed to make would you care? The better option may possibly be the $.1 but that does come at a cost to the network. Additionally there may be ways in which the upfront fees to get on LN are subsidized if someone poor cannot afford the $100 for example.  "

I completely agree with you, and was just playing devils advocate. Personally, I *do* hope to see Bitcoin Cash accumulate the most PoW. I think some miners hold this view as well - considering that Bitcoin Cash miners have been holding their coins rather than dumping.

Satoshi designed the network so that by the time the block reward disappears, it is still profitable to mine, and the network retains its POW security model. How can syphoning money away from the very foundation of the blockchain security model be a good idea?
I know you don't know the first thing about compressing data. You know that too, yet you still comment.
It is.
Electrum 3.0 just came out yesterday, which I believe is the first mainstream lite wallet to support segwit. Expect segwit usage to get a significant bump this week. 
"Those are the attacks Bitcoin faces. If it cannot adjust in the presence of them, then it is broken. If such attacks can cause Bitcoin to fail then it was doomed from the start.

If a proposed system is meant to withstand assault, it must be able to survive when the adversary is in a position of advantage. The worst-case outcome must be at least as damaging to the adversary as anyone else. The next-worse outcome can be neutral, so long as there exists a strategy for the adversary that is advantageous to everyone. If that win-win strategy provides the adversary with a greater advantage, they will be even more incentivized to follow it."
If they are actively dumping BTC for BCH they are adding to the value of their own BCH holdings by adding upward pressure.

"Bitcoin Cash isn't part of the NYA. Miners aren't breaking any ""agreement"" by mining it."
"I mean, I can get that.

But you  have to realize the scope of adoption. BARELY anyone knows about Bitcoin.

An even smaller percentage know about Bitcoin Cash. An even smaller percentage know about S2x. 

For the sake of adoption, you *want* Bitcoin to do well, you just don't want Core to do well. You want as many people as you can to know about it, that gets people adopting Bitcoin cash and makes it a worldwide thing.

You don't want new people into the market getting confused over all sorts of meandering forks. You want people to understand, adopt, and utilize Bitcoin, then if Bitcoin cash is more efficient, they will adopt and understand that.

You want BTC to be workable, not destroyed. 

I get the hatred towards Core's dumbass moves - I just don't think wanting Bitcoin itself gutted helps anyone.  We like to think we're a huge community but in the world market, the people who know the inner workings are tiny - Mainstream adoption is near, so I would think you want a workable, but flawed main Chain (So it gets fixed/upgraded - Without flaws, there is no need to) and a functional, usable sidechain (Bitcoin Cash) that people can use and adopt in the meantime."
cant even find the words to answer to your non sense, re read the discussion.
Because it makes no sense to have intermediaries siphon off profits via lightning networks when having those same transactions on-chain would result in miners receiving 100% of the profits, instead of a percentage of them.
When 2x fails, BTC won't look back and BCH will lose value, and continue to do so after January when Coinbase opens up withdraws.
">This is because segwit is meant to facilitate the siphoning/stealing of tx's fees to offchain providers, like LN hubs or sidechain federated servers. 

That's what I don't like about segwit... I like the idea of segregation in order to compact the transaction to make it smaller, it's the ""smarter"" choice over just adding more size, but not if it opens the flood doors to entities outside the chain to incur their own fees, this pretty much defeats the purpose.

I would rather give small fees to mostly decentralized network of miners instead of miners+big enterprises "
They are probably heavily invested in BCH and would just as soon see 2X fail so everyone who want's big blocks has to use BCH.
Why is it in their best interests? While slow confirmations and high tx fees suck for users, it seems like those high fees would be great for miners.

"I dont see the benefit in doing as he says. He cannot pay electricity bills with BCH.   
Indeed he cannot pay for much at all with BCH as of now.  
I see why he is saying it, he wants to support BCH for whatever reason, but I have to call bull on this"
Exactly .  Check btcfees.com
so much dumb shit in these comments
You guys can keep pointing your hash here. He's saying that if 2X is still more profitable to mine then he'll mine that to buy BCH.
Miners want to AsicBoost? NoWai
"All I see is:

He knows his place."
if it were a profitable strategy, he wouldn't share it
Hypocrisy 
"> ViaBTC [...] indicating that his pool will only offer bitcoin mining on the original bitcoin chain to begin. ""We have not received user request to run 2x.  If 2x survives and the users request it, we will support both. [...]""

Wow. This looks like ViaBTC has effectively withdrawn from NYA. A very strong contrast with their extensive support when Bitcoin Cash forked. Are they giving up on the SegWit branch?"
[deleted]
Well that's good for my Bitcoin Cash investment! 
"Pump & then dump BCH for bitcoin at > $7000   I would say the same :)
"
Is anyone tracking expected 2x mining power going into the fork? I know there is the signaling data but apparently that doesn't matter much...
Wouldn't it make more sense to just mine BCH?
0.0003 BCH /u/tippr
Great to see lots of people supporting Bitcoin Cash for all sorts of reasons.
Great to hear.
">BTC.Top's own mining aside, the company plans to allow customers to ""choose to mine any coin"" or automatically switch between blockchains, turning their computing power to whatever coin is most lucrative, even after Segwit2x

> Haipo Yang, CEO of ViaBTC, the fourth largest pool by mining power, agreed, indicating that his pool will only offer bitcoin mining on the original bitcoin chain to begin.
""We have not received user request to run 2x. If 2x survives and the users request it, we will support both. Let the users have a choice,"" he told CoinDesk via WeChat.

LOL. And yet people are saying miners have agreed to support Segwit2X, it will have 85% hashrate, original chain will die very soon, blah blah blah"
I'd be more interested to hear his rationale on why he thinks bitcoin investors will switch to bitcoin cash, because honestly switching money is like switching social networks...rarely happens en masse.
I hope 2X LOSES, so BCH WINS.  
So he doesnt mine the coin he supports?
"Thats a good point, if 2x fails i think BCH will go to the moon. Thats the main reason I am still holding bitcoin atm.

That and the fucken EDA & address format issue"
I have some mining contracts there. This forces me to switch them to Bitcoin Cash as I will do anything in my power to not mine Segwit1x.
Miners must defend their own personal best interests. Supporting Bitcoin Cash is in their best interests. As a matter of fact, it is in everyone's best interest--except for Blockstream and Core.
"Perhaps you should work on setting up a project hosting a node-set that relays transactions, but only to entities that:

1) Hold less than X% of the hashing power.
2) Sign an agreement that they will not relay the transaction in such a way that miners with more than X% of hashing power will see it.

That way; there'd be a venue available for transactions that refuse to pay transaction fees to large miners.

Just an idea, I doubt it will ever come to life."

LN fees would basically be zero so the % being sighpned off would probably be irrelevent or the extra cost would be made up with the added efficiency of using the LN rather than maintaining a massive blockchain.. there is a win win scenario and not just a lose win, win lose for miners and users. 
"That's what I don't like about segwit...

This thinking is incorrect. Segregation does compact your notion of block. But at the end you still need block + signatures for it to have any meaning. So you will always need to transfer everything block + signatures.
So now you get transactions that actually take up more space, since a transaction will always include the reference to the signature data vs just having the full data on the so called block. "
">I like the idea of segregation in order to compact the block to make it smaller, it's the ""smarter"" 

Explain how segwit does this? It doesn't. It just gives a fee discount for the segregated section so when the backlogs get high people are incentivized to use it."
">>This is because segwit is meant to facilitate the siphoning/stealing of tx's fees to offchain providers, like LN hubs or sidechain federated servers. 
>
>That's what I don't like about segwit... but not if it opens the flood doors to entities outside the chain to incur their own fees....  

I don't understand why this is an issue. Does this not create competition in the fee market? Does the everyday user not benefit from fee competition? Does this not create more choice, competition, and opportunity in the ""fee market"". I don't see why this is bad. "
"> I like the idea of segregation in order to compact the block to make it smaller, it's the ""smarter"" choice over just adding more size

It is not the smarter choice at all, it is a last resort hack. SegWit transactions are not more compact. Unless you do not count the witness part, which does not make sense. SegWit TX need more bytes per transaction in total. Even Luke-jr recommends not using SegWit for normal transactions, only for 2nd layer. Just increasing the block size, fixing malleability and quadratic hashing on all transactions would have been the smart choice, but that would have been a ""dangerous"" hard fork. "
"Currency is meant to transact and charging fees for services is how people trade their personal utility for wealth. Enabling commerce and the fees it generates is very much within the purpose of Bitcoin.

If a good idea exists and competes with Bitcoin, so be it. If that idea endangers Bitcoin and an adjustment cannot be made while maintaining the fundamental security of the blockchain, then Bitcoin was _already_ broken."
Don’t project. :/
He expects Bitcoin Cash to rise massively in the future and thus be extremely profitable.

Good! Leave 1x to win! Much easier for BCH to crush 1x! Let users decide please 😂
The users want bitcoin and not corporatized SegWit coin by fat cat developers.
I see your point but it's different for money. People sell a stock that becomes a dog. People abandon a currency that becomes weak. That's why you can spend USD in countries with weak currency.
"I honestly don't see why this isn't the prevailing attitude.

Yeah, I get it, a lot of people here don't like Core and want Core to fail, but I think the actual best solution is for 2x to die, and Core to fumble enough in order to actually upgrade properly.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash benefits, the Bitcoin network gets much needed upgrades, and supporters on both sides profit. 

I dunno, maybe I'm a minority, but I see a world where the above happens and both sides are happy. I just don't see S2x as any sort of positive upgrade, more a spite move."
Prefers to keep pumping it with rewards earned via mining BTC, hope for FOMO, then dump. Rinse repeat. May actually turn out to me more lucrative than holding BTC.....IF youre a major miner. 
"I think at present leading up to the split this approach is sound, during and after the split sides will need to be supported.

If sides aren't properly supported it puts long-term risk on the security of the minority hash chain.

Surprisingly it increasingly seems 2x isn't going to be supported, well, at least from what I see..  If this is the case miners should fully support Bitcoin (cash), as compromise isn't in the vocabulary of Core, and as a result a crippled coin is going to be the norm.

If miners happen to choose the short-term over the medium to long term on the next split, to be honest, I'll be a bit disillusioned.

Bitcoin (cash) is showing tremendous potential, and it's success will also wake up a lot of the 'early' (this year) adopters as to how they have been blindsided by censorship.  This will in generaly make the community more resilent in the future, which is a good thing."
Me too. Even though I have like .008 BCH.
"There is nothing in NYA that says that have to hash on 2x.
""[..] committed to provide technical and engineering support to test and support the upgrade software, as well as to assist companies with preparing for the upgrades""

As long as they don't mine on 1x, they're more or less good to go."
That's such a bold statement. It's the opposite picture core trolls are painting where miners dump BCH for btc. 
"although america itself is kind of dilapidated right now lives in western and scandinavian countries are soooooooo much more well provided for than russia or other similarly cultured systems, i really have to disagree. 

usa will be fine if they keep up with their newfound self awareness and make improvements, there's no need to tear down the system completely, and certainly no need for the division being generated and stoked by external forces with other priorities "
"Nice. Got a couple sweet totebags with Bitcoin Cash and a fee of about five cents.  I went to eat after I hit send, but it had three confirmations within half an hour or so.   That's the way Bitcoin is supposed to work.

I did point Julian to the AXA investment a few months ago but really it's Coinpayments.net that's handing the backend so it's just a checkbox."
