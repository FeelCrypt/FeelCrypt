See that’s a dope outcome, and exactly why kids now thinking that 150$ of BTC is going to make them rich when that’s 1% of a bitcoin. Fucking congrats on that though man that’s amazing.

"r/btc is an uncensored bitcoin forum, that happens to prefer BCH. Btc is broken, you won’t see people advocating for it on r/btc. But it is discussed (mainly its many prevalent issues). And most of us here *do* want people introduced to BCH, which we believe is the better bitcoin. 

Lastly, r/btc is used for BCH discussion because well, you can’t talk about it (in any positive manner) on r/bitcoin. "
Can't form a coherent English sentence, mature btw

The person who hates bitcoin? Got in or out too late and never saw the payday. "
What is segwit and LN? 
I had a buddy pick up 50 at 32$ earlier this year. He has been a very happy dude 
"Downvoting is a feature- criticizing its use isn’t effective. There’s really (honestly) not much positive about btc. It’s been taken over by a private company for their own gain, and the censorship on r/bitcoin is legitimately out of control. It wouldn’t matter if btc was the holy grail of crypto, the surrounding issues are much bigger and drown out any positive btc might have. 

(Like the hot chick who smokes and sounds like coyote in a trash compactor...doesn’t matter how good she looks at that point)"
"Bitcoin cash is bitcoin, more so than btc is bitcoin. Bitcoin was meant to scale on-chain (among other scaling solutions). Segwit and LN were not part of the original bitcoin, so adding them in actually changes bitcoin more than bitcoin cash did. 

Also, if there was a sudden big drop in hash power (ie- a lot of miners switch to BCH or a different sha 256 crypto), confirmation times could take hours or days and the network would grind to a halt (instead of 300,000 transactions per day could be something like only 100,000 or less)"

Nice. This one's even better because it demonstrates bitcoin's inferiority.
No one is oppressed!  Either your fighting or submitting!!!!!
I paid a $150 fee on the 19th to send some bitcoin, and it took 4 days to confirm.
I agree, and what a beautiful sight!  I'd prefer a multitude of crypto symbols on the sign, though
I'd say it aged perfectly. Core isn't bitcoin.
Fees ballooning to over $30 to send a single transaction in a reasonable time is all the evidence I need of complete incompetence as stewards of Bitcoin.

Not to mention that if you bought a burger in 2013 with Bitcoin, that burger should be worth $7000 today
Thank you kind, sir! :D 
I'm done wasting time with you, you're talking in circles and we're not going to agree. You simply do not want to actually talk things out, you just want to find a way to be right. If you actually looked at what I typed an refuted my points, this conversation would be valuable, but you simply pick a couple points, argue a sub-point or technicality and then shift to other things.
">According to this page, it's a lot higher. Between 14.7 Million wallets and 15.9 Million depending on the time of transaction cannot pay for a single transaction. Today. Not in the future. Link

Interesting to know where I stood at 2016.

>Auctions don't charge more than a couple percent at the worst case. This is not the case with everything but transactions between the top 150,000 wallets. This is a very small pie, especially because a lot of BTC will be lost to the sands of time.

Incorrect. Most auction houses charge a minimum commission amount - this is usually a set fee, or a percentage of the sale if the fee is exceeded. If a piece of art is worth $100, and the auction commission is $250, this would make art not a very good store of value, by your standard.

>And I said that I disagreed, and posited that this is because of the first mover advantage. No one can prove it's your reason or mine.

No I didn't. You did.

>You did nothing to my opinion, this is the stupid attitude I'm talking about. I simply expanded on what I posted earlier.

The thing is, you do understand - see your later points.

>So, do you understand Metcalfe's law, care to weigh in?

That a value of a system/network can be approximately determined by the square of a number of the connected users, similar to how FB is determined in value? What of it?

>So do you understand monetary velocity, care to weigh in?

Difficult to say, as the transaction volume is clearly stunted by the transaction issues Bitcoin is stunting. I fail to see how this has any relation to store of value - as we've already covered, something with no utility (such as art) can still be classed as a store of value (I know you've already covered art later on, but let me tell you now that you are short-sighted in that regard - read on to find out more).

>See number 4. You think you know more than other people and you're simply wrong. This attitude bleeds into what you type, and makes you alienate people who you could learn from. But I guess you already knew that.

When you say something which has no utility has no store of value, then I do know more than you in that regard. Everyone knows something moreso than someone else - just because I know more about store of value than you, doesn't mean I know more than you about everything. I'm sure there are plenty of things you know more about than me. Try not to be so insecure. This is reddit, not a trial.

>The closest competitor to BTC does what it does and more. This is why I'm comparing them, what do you want to compare it to? They're both better stores of value than most things in the world right now, that's why we're here as apposed to r/goldbugs

So now BTC is a store of value?

I don't want to compare BTC to anything. I've mentioned art and gold, purely to illustrate the point to you that a store of value doesn't necessitate utility. You're adamant to bring in BCH for your transparent agenda of boosting BCH over BTC, which I've said time and time again that I'm not very interested in (being a holder of both, and finding the childish antics of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin to be mind numbing).

>Art= You can look at it, you can use it to explain oppression, you can use it to enlighten people, to bring order, to simply add colour to a . You can show beauty. I can keep going, but it's obvious when you go into a building that doesn't and then suddenly does have things on the walls. People wanting 'the best' of these drive up cost and the art world is also a money laundering racket.

By that same vein, BTC represents to many decentralization, anti-establishment, self-control, something ""cool"" to have. It doesn't matter if BTC is truly not any of these things, just as it doesn't matter if the piece of art which one viewed as beautiful, was actually a grotesque symbolism of the artist's pedophilia. It is the notion of value, prescribed by human emotion. This is purely what drives everything in the world.

So by this vein, you can understand how art has just as much utility as BTC, unless you are truly so superficial as to think just because you can see something, it has value - no value in any cryptocurrency then. 

>I'm speaking about the amount of wallets I talked about eariler.

I don't know what you're referring to.

>Please explain how the fees will go down as more people try to transact on it. If you say LN, best case is 50% reduction from the horse's mouth.

I believe you want to go to LN. You're diverting this away from the topic of discussion, which is that you believe a store of value needs utility, which it doesn't.

"I literally responded to every point you made. I'm sorry I've not allowed this discussion to become a BTC vs BCH shitfest, like the rest of the subforum is. 

Final point then:

A store of value doesn't require utility - art. 

You really should have just understood you were wrong right then and there. "
"Every time you get called on your shit, you just ignore it.

Looking through your post history, you are literally a terrible person. Constant garbage posting, while also posting against women, and calling people fat. Seems everyone who comes across you has the same terrible experience I am having. And when you get proven wrong you just disappear and stop responding like you did before with our discussion over Moore's Law. Oh, but then you made up a lie saying you responded.

And guess what, because the blockchain is still easy to run full nodes, it could easily be forked so that users could have a say in how it is run.

You know, like what they did with bcash. Except with bcash going the way it is, if it ever got popular forking would no longer be accessible for people since the blockchain would be too large.

But Blockstream doesn't own Bitcoin. So looks like you're wrong again."
"I'm convinced you're being paid to waste people's time with nonsensical arguments.

Reconcile your belief that corporations can't be trusted with your trust in Blockstream, a corporation with a publicly stated business model of neutering Bitcoin so it can charge for sidechains..."
"Because it is a strawman argument.

Do you know what that means?

""an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.""

There is zero chances that corporations would spend the money to maintain such a massive service, and not use that to their advantage.

Therefor, your hypothetical situation of ""the rich validating the TX of the poor"" will never happen. You have no basis to claim that it will happen.

That makes your argument a straw man argument."
Still won't answer the question. We're done here.
I get the differential value of BCH (and other alts) but many blockchains will have a scaling issue if they become more popular. BTC has the liquidity despite the tx costs, so keep an eye on Lightning Network and payment channels. For the purists - Nakamoto apparently talks about using payment channels. 2018 has to be the year off-chain solutions start delivering. Meanwhile the recent trend of alts outperforming (market cap growth) bitcoin will continue. 
"Which is preferable?

A system in which the poor validate transactions for the rich.

Or a system in which the rich validate transactions for the poor."
Which was? Or did you fabricate something else to ease your cognitive dissonance?
lol, go back to shill land. I've wasted far too much time engaging you considering you still haven't answered the first question I asked you.
"Fuck are you even talking about?

You know, forget it. You're an obvious troll. You can't truly believe one corporation being in control of the dev process is benign, but a hundred thousand corporations running full nodes is malevolent. Fuck off."
"You keep saying this, but in what world would corporations validate anything for free when they could charge money?

Corporations routinely screw people over in search of profit. As profit is the purpose of a corporation. Every single place a corporation could use its weight to milk more profits out of people, they do.

You think once they control the currency as well, that they will now become altruistic and do it for free? 

They will do like they will, and continue to do, use every possible advantage to pull more profits out of people."
"Looks like you're doing it again. 

Can't handle anyone proving you wrong since you just hide in the r/btc echo chamber.

It's like your tiny little ego is breaking.
"
"But Iota is kind of a confusing semi-disaster that can't be decentralized, and I haven't heard any solution to Rai dealing with cheap and easy spam attacks.

This right here is part of the reason I hold *neither* coin. The fundamentals are weak, but on top of that the communities are pretty toxic, as well. Honestly, this bitter, undying feud over two lackluster cryptos is embarrassing for the whole crypto community.
Have you been watching XRP and to a lesser extent, STR?  *Everything* was nose diving and XRP just kept going up.  We need to see more of that from other coins.
"It's weird, I agree on some points. Like how the whole situation degraded to a shit fest. 

I personally see less problems with big blocks and the advancement of technology in the future than the stuff I have heard about LN but hey, if it makes you happy more power to you. It's a free market and in the end the broad mass decides."

Lets not use this argument. That's the same shit they used to shove segwit down everyone\s throat with the UASF. 
"The interesting thing is that no one who uses bitcoin cash actually calls it bcash. Blockstream and the people who run /r/bitcoin gave it that name and made a concerted effort to get the community to call that. So if its users don't even use that name you have to ask why anyone would keep saying it so much?

This is why a lot of people think the name bcash is used to cause confusion with another product with the same name. "

"""understood"" is fine for those who created the term (r/bitcoin & core).

""widely understood"" is false and disingenuous.

do you seriously think core _did not_ create the term to discredit bitcoin cash? who is living in denial now?"
I can confirm! 
ok i added the archive link. I still have the direct link so people can report correction. 
Oh thanks! :).

QuadrigaCX, Coinbase, Trezor, Ledger. I can name several off the top of my head. It sounds like you need to spend more time reading and learning what's out there.
Try buying an antminer from Bitmain... You MUST pay in BCH.  I guess bitmain is just a nobody?
"False.  

Bcash is the official name of a Brazilian company.

https://bcash.com.br  

On google trends, the term Bitcoin Cash is far more popular than Bcash, EXCEPT in Brazil.

The term Bitcoin Cash is used by CCN.com, CoinTelegraph.com, Coinbase, Bitpay, Coinify, Coinmarketcap.com, bitcoincash.org, etc.

99% of the websites & services in the cryptocurrency world use the term ""Bitcoin Cash""

The ONLY people using the made up slur ""Bcash"" are opponents in the Bitcoin BTC community."
It's something else. That's like calling Bitcoin Bytecoin.
"The idea with calling it ""Bitcoin Cash"" is to make the intent clear that its community would like to not be considered just another altcoin, but instead a fork vying for the title of Bitcoin. The community backing BCH feels like the core BTC coin has veered off-track from the founding principles of Bitcoin. If BTC dropped to $0 and all hash power transferred to BCH, the community around BCH would want to assume the Bitcoin name.

99.9% of people calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"" are not just shortening the name, but are intentionally trying to distance the coin in people's minds from the core concept of Bitcoin. Doing so paves over the long history and scaling debate that gave birth to the fork, and pushes the narrative more in lines of BCH being just one of ~1400 arbitrary cryptocurrencies. This is felt to be disrespectful in the BCH community, and so they'd prefer not to have it called ""bcash""."
"If you want to live in denial it's your choice.

Maybe ""accepted"" is not the correct word, ""understood"" might be better. "
I don't know how the name Bcash discredits anything. Yes, it doesn't have the word Bitcoin in it. The name Coke doesn't have Coca or Cola in it either. I don't hear any Coca-Cola lover complaining.
"CMC said it best: the name of the coin cannot be changed if the changes aren't verifiable on an official resource related to that particular coin/token.

https://mobile.twitter.com/coinmarketcap/status/936645622593179648

Can you post an official source of your statement that bcash is widely accepted? It's only accepted by coretards"
Nicely done!
"Kyle [corrected it himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mt41c/kyle_torpey_kyletorpey_forbes_contributor_calls/drwru4h/), that's good on him even when the ""mistake"" shouldn't be there in the first place.

Forbes has nothing to do with the ""article"", it's essentially a glorified blog from their ""contributors"" so there is that.

It would be great if he could remove the derogatory nickname Bcash as it screams bias and unprofessionalism but well, I'm not holding my breath as he apparently is biased and unprofessional so maybe that's the impression he wants to make."
Just reappropriate the term and make a positive one the community can center around. Then it loses its effect of making you all whine like petulant children about someone concatenating a letter and common word. Bcash is just word. Grow past it.
"It’s Bcash ya filthy animals

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRoCaf1UQAAL4C0?format=jpg&name=large"
"Sure it does. In fact, you’ve volunteered the intent for the name: to remove a reference to bitcoin. Notice that not a single actual supporter of the coin calls it “bcash”.

Is everyone else in denial, or are you?"
"*Bcash is a widely ~~accepted~~ understood name for Bitcoin Cash.* Just like a lot of people use Coke instead of Coca-Cola. 

I know that there is also another project that is called Bcash that has nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash which might cause confusion. But usually you know from context what they mean. Like you know the difference between Coke and coke."
Then you may really be  a retard. Try thinking maybe
The problem with that though is that he gets views for everytime someone clicks that link, and that makes forbes think its a valuable article and will as a result promote it, and also brings in ad revenue. He shouldn't profit off being wrong
Use dogcoin if you want low fee
Agree, but I don't know of a direct link to suggest corrections.
Inb4 CCola
Done
They can email corrections@forbes.com, but at this point there's no directly false information in the article as far as I can tell (regarding the bcash refference, you can dm him in twitter), so theres nothing more to correct. In refference to the forbes.com link you posted, the more views it gets the more it will be promoted by forbes. If you use the archive.is link, it won't get any views since its a cached version of the site
Sorry for my ignorance but, what's the problem with calling it Bcash? After some thought I switched from bitcoin to BTC since I consider it superior but I'm still learning a thing here and there.
"Bitcoin Cash is such a terrible name, to begin with. Doesn't sound professional at all. Rebrand or stop complaining when the world will inevitably continue calling it Bcash. 

In before downvoted... I understand the concern, it just seems futile and incredibly stupid to fight against."
Now if he would not call it Bcash.

Isn’t bitcoin cash actually zero?
People actually use litecoin.  
Good on Forbes.
"Strange that they only coin they chose to add a special name in brackets for was Bitcoin Cash. Why bother when none of the others are abbreviated in the same way?
 
The propaganda runs deep."
bcash is a zcash fork coming in 18'
Original OP here, you should change the forbes link to https://archive.is so we don't give them undeserved views
If Pepsi will hijack the coca cola name and pay a bunch of people to start calling coca cola as coke, that would be a valid analogy. 
"Nah, even google recognizes Bcash as Bitcoin Cash. Not a big deal...

EDIT: [For all the downvoters](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bcash)"
"Absolutly.

Why not call Ethereum KittyCoin or Litecoin BTCtestnetcoin?"
Bitcoin cash as the coin that more closely fulfills Satoshi's vision is the real Bitcoin. Calling it bcash removed Bitcoin from it's name. 
"> what's the problem with calling it Bcash?

Two projects wear that name: Brazilian company and future Zcash fork"

What's wrong with Bcash? It's easy to say and everyone knows it by that already
"> False

True. The most popular name of Bitcoin for now is Bitcoin Cash. Open blockchains don't have anything official and can't have it. Only market-based emerging consensus

> The ONLY people using the made up slur ""Bcash"" are opponents in the Bitcoin BTC community

Agree"
"That was the prevailing argument. 

"
These numbers are inflated due to several wallets defaulting to higher fees. In reality since the blocks are never full, 0 satoshi transactions confirm in a block or 2. With No RBF and no backlogged mempool, 0 confirmation instantaneous transactions actually make sense on BCH. 
...to trade for USD on coinbase
That's ok though, once Bitcoin core is dead it will just be called Bitcoin. 
People actually use crypto.

"Right?!? Nobody calls scam-coin Bitcoin Gold bgold.

">telling them to get their heads out of their asses for not accepting bch

Okay"
"If you ran a node it might broadcast your transactions to nodes that would black hole the transaction. You would have no way to know they were doing this.  All you could do is ensure that your node was connected to multiple other nodes.  SPV nodes can do the same thing.  There is no difference in cost to this solution.
"
"> You would have no way to know they were doing this.

Query their mempool...

I mentioned nothing of cost. "
Querying a node's mempool will be of no use if its attempting to block your transactions.
"You either A) Know it's propagating B) Know it's not propagating

Miners want money. 
"
Incorrect. A SPV may not relay your transaction. You're trusting they'll broadcast it. 
Everyone does.
