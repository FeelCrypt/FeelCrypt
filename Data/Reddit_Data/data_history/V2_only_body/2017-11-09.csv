"Hmmmmm...  I don't see bitcoin segwit on coinmarketcap.  I do see bitcoin, and it's in the number one spot.  Been that way since I've been paying attention.  Heck, it's over 7k and has been going up for a long time.  I think I'll go buy some, it looks like a winner.

" I've lost a lot of respect for all involved in pulling out of Segwit2x. 

Why, with around 80% of miner support didn't they go ahead with this?  

They've just let core / small blockers 'win' without a challenge. 

Perhaps they plan to switch from Segwit2x to Bitcoin Cash to get a more significant blocksize increase plus getting rid of Segwit, but there's no indication of this so far, and even if they did this they have still failed to keep their word in a very significant way.

Spineless, unbelievable behavior by those who said they were committed to 2x who have seemingly surrendered Bitcoin to Core / blockstream from a winning position.

"> You are looking at scaling solution, saying it doesnt work WHEN COMPANIES ARE NOT USING IT.

Then it is a failure. It is not a scaling solution. A solution would mean it was solved. It hasn't been. Even with 100% Segwit adoption, there will still be full blocks in no time. The real solution is to increase the Blocksize when blocks are full. Simple is safe. There's a reason for the K.I.S.S. acronym, ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""

> Bitcoin has NOT upgraded to segwit until companies SWITCH TO SEGWIT addresses. Is this CLEAR YET? Are you incapable of understanding something so simple? How can you POSSIBLY say segwit doesn't work well when THEY AREN'T USING IT?

I never said it didn't work. I did allude to it being a failure. Whether it's a failure of adoption or a failure to scale, it's still a failure. Many of the major proponents said it would provide immediate or nearly immediate relief from high fees. It hasn't. It's a failure.

>No shit the fee is rising, THEY ARE NOT USING SEGWIT. Is it really impossible to understand that you will not get 10cent fees if you are NOT USING THE NEW ADDRESSES? How deluded can you get?

If everyone was using Segwit, there would be no discount for Segwit transactions. Simple economics, no?

"Gold gained its reserve status after millennia of use as a currency.. alongside things like silver, copper, etc. Either way, your diatribe misses the fundamentals of bitcoin by miles, ignoring everything about the initial value proposition that propelled its growth. 

The skyrocketing value of bitcoin was meant to happen naturally as ""node level"" horizontal meshing took place --- which in the real world is called *small, local economies.* This meant people getting introduced to bitcoin through common purchases, especially appealing to food and other daily tx. 

This meant eventually, millions of *real people - economic actors* would be *naturally* invested in the network. As the network effect took hold and btc rose, hundreds of poorer communities around the world would ride an upward tide, a true global renaissance.

Instead, the system has been perverted by greed and lust for power.  The idea of turning bitcoin into a ""store of value"" is so completely tangent to what it was designed for and what ""to the moon"" really meant. It meant ""to the moon, *together.*"" ... instead we have some insane speculator driven greed where ""institutional money"" has come into the space looking for ""settlement and store of wealth."" 

Lmfao dude! Banks have bonds and ACH and shit. Their use case for bitcoin is zero. See hyperledger and xrp. They'll just privatize internal chains for the ""real money"" after they have secured comfortable positions in the ""public"" cryptos. 

It was always about the end users coming together to profit as a cooperative commonwealth of economic producers. Never, ever, ever about banks and credit companies being able to settle larger orders in international markets.

> But why is still worth so much?

Because this: http://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml

> It is all about the math, without the math, it is nothing

No, it's all about the economics. Cool numbers on an interesting computer network are not worth 7000 dollars except to a bunch of morons *if it has no actual use.* And Bitcoin's only primary, fundamental use is *as a currency.* All of its ""store of value"" use *is derived from* and *depends* on that primary use as a currency.

> So long as people are selling things for bitcoin on the internet, it will carry its use case as a daily currency. I don't see a scenario by which the internet stops selling items for digital currency, whether it be bitcoin or some other alt.

The value of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is not calculated in a vacuum, but rather *relative to alternatives.*"
I would be surprised if bitcoin cash ever gets such a fix. Miners don't like 2nd layer (no hate on them, it is rational for them to not want that). Miners seem to have much more power over bitcoin cash than they have over btc.

"The slavery abolition movement began in May with a simple purpose: to end slavery and improve the lives of former slaves. At the time, the American community was in crisis after nearly a century of heavy debate and consensus for slavery seemed like a distant mirage with only 50% support among white land owning males.

Our goal has always been a smooth increase of freedom. Although we strongly believe in the need for abolishing slavery, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping America together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean slavery abolishment at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the country and be a setback for America's expansion. This was never the goal of the abolition movement.

As slavery increases in the south, we believe it will become obvious that freedom increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the country will come together and find a solution, with possibly an end to slavery. Until then, we are suspending our plans for a civil war.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to the abolition movement, whether you were for or against. Your efforts are what makes America great. America remains the greatest country mankind has ever seen, and we remain dedicated to protecting it and fostering its expansion continent-wide.

I honestly don't think anyone from the pro-Core camp will be actively fighting Bitcoin Cash now (as in, putting a lot of time/money/effort into it).

"I agree with all of this, but you never spoke to why gold is preferred as a reserve currency over arcade tickets.  

> ignoring everything about the initial value proposition that propelled its growth.  

without the math, there is *no proposition to begin with* my friend. Without maximum decentralization, there is no proposition. Reserve currency is just one use case. Bitcoin right now fits the most important use case of all, which is store of value.

However,  I will praise your post, as I think otherwise you are accurate. The problem as I see it is that adoption has rapidly outgrown research and development of the actual block.  

I'm definitely not a small blocker only, that is a foolish idea unless we could realistically compress the data to fit and give low fees. Ultimately, compression and proper arrangement of the block through prudent development is preferred to expanding the block size or off chain solutions. In a perfect setting the block would be 1b in size, but that is probably impossible in every sense. Realistically, it is going to be a combination of diligent engineering and upping the block size as needed; hell maybe one day someone figures out a new and novel way to compress the data and we can lower the limit to 1kb or whatever. I *hope* we don't have to use off chain solutions at all, but depending upon their design and implementation they can work as well but I think we need to think long and hard before relying on them as a crutch.

Sorry if I came off as combative. I think bitcoin and bitcoin cash supporters should come together and demand the formation of some kind of entity that can do the diligent research necessary. Blockstream doesn't have the appropriate amount of trust among the user base, that much is obvious. It would be nice to get university research involved.  

Anyways, Szabo said in an interview that we may go through a few versions of bitcoin, and that it could be completely plausible that they come and go. So we need to be ready for whatever."

U're wrong. Hashrate is jointed, divorce can't be peaceful. People like Richard Heart understand it and try to do everything in their power to evaporate Bitcoin Cash. It's a straight and optimal strategy, more blows to come our way
Go and breathe some air. Clear your thoughts
this is called a hardfork. a single miner can only reject segwit transactions to be mined

What sucks about forking is that we're essentially starting over in terms of adoption. It should be relatively easy for bitpay/coinbase since it's still the same technology but I think BCH users have to push for it. It's still an investment for them in building internal infrastructure to support BCH.

Why would it be a stupid business decision not to adopt it? Coinbase did do litecoin so I think BCH has a pretty good change but it's no guarantee."

My point with the previous comment is that miners aren't the issue, holders are. If they manipulate the scene so much that nobody buys Cash and stick with their Settlement coin, well, that's what Bitcoin will become, a settlement network. 
Fair point, decent of you to admit there are more advanced coins as well
Do you know what a 51% attack is? Because you're describing it, and it's a real thing. 
Exactly. Core's fee market can not work with 1MB blocks. In 1 MB blockspace you can only fit a few thousand transactions. If you want a secure chain, you need to put a lot of work (=money for mining) in it and get returns. With only 144 Blocks per day and (lets be generous) 3000 transactions/block, in the long run everyone has to pay 1/(144*3000) of the total mining cost per day for every transaction. This means that either the chain will not be very secure or transaction will be very expensive. To pay the current miner reward (and thereby keep the chain as secure as now) just with fees, every transaction would cost ~$30.
"If one developer proposes an idea and develops it, great. Nice work. That's how bitcoin started right? We assume it was Satoshi (one person).

BUT, now that it's a $120 BILLION dollar market, it should be tested by as many developers as possible. It should have the smartest minds in crypto trying to break the developed idea of that developer over a period of time. Then, if the majority of these developers deem it to be safe and robust code, it will be released to the community for their feedback, and the miners/users/companies will decide whether they want to adopt it.

That is what I would consider the correct process to proposing an improvement/upgrade/change to Bitcoin. I'm sorry but if you believe the way the SegWit2x ""upgrade"" was pushed on to the community (with $120B of people's money at stake) was fair and morally correct, you're either lying to yourself or you're not asking enough questions."
BCH was formed because it was obvious to a group of people how petty, zealous and closed minded core was. And they were right.
"Segwit activation or not, prominent people in industry may remove segwit support on their platforms, making segwit adoption fall. 

**Keep an eye on:  http://segwit.party/charts/ **"
"The fact that 2x failed lends support to my belief that it wasn't good.

The problem with 2x is that it had no real ideological backing. Moderates don't have the passion necessary to be trend-setters, and cryptocurrency is all about following the loudest voices."
Bigger blocks == less full nodes == less decentralization.
Nope, it's just Roger Ver's way to get people to buy coins he bought cheap, before all this happened. What is next? VerCoin?

"Hmmm... I think you know what I'm talking about here. Lets use some common sense...

I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, but it should most certainly be safer than having one developer working on the solution, without a full team of developers testing the shit out of it over a long period of time, and a final proposal (with replay protection) so that you don't risk the users money, no?

And even scratch that for a second... how about a proposal that includes the development team? Not just a handful of business owners behind closed doors. Do you realise just how much damage this would have done to bitcoin had it worked? It would mean bitcoin isn't safe from small groups of people with big wallets.... what's next? Them proposing to increase the supply from 21M? 

It would mean Bitcoin is broken."

"Did you go into BTC solely for the free coins?

Oh my am I glad I'm not you."
Yes, every blockchain needs miners to enfore the rules of that blockchain. Doesn't contradict anything I said.
I'd shed a tear with you, if it wasn't for the fact that I'm not 100% certain S2X is dead yet. NYA is, but S2X might still happen -.-
Yes, if by this you mean that some of the signatories of the suspension of the NYA agreement have come out on public media and confirmed the story.
"My favorite desktop wallet at the moment is Exodus.io, which is a multiwallet with shapeshift support. It supports Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash (and BTC)

As good as this is, it is not a replacement for proper cold wallets and backups for your larger savings. Desktop wallets should only be used for temporary storage and only with as much coin as is needed. That said, Exodus does have a recovery option too."

... you already have segwit. maybe try using it?
"Read the whitepaper; bitcoin cash is just as much, if not more, bitcoin than the core segwit chain."
"They started a cult.  They figure if they say ""NUH UH WE ARE BITCOIN"" enough times the crypto world will just go ahead and say ok, you guys are bitcoin now.  It's kinda funny to watch, but then again, a little sad.  At least BCH is up in the last few weeks.  If that shit drops back down to the 300s they're really going to lose it."
Because they want to make more money from people buying it. Not difficult to see the strategy. Make new coin, hype it, price goes up, sell quickly before it collapse. 
"It wasn't supposed to be a split but to replace the chain. Also called an **upgrade**.

Agreed but bitcoin brand is huge and it’s been hi jacked. BCH is better in every way but that’s hard to explain to a noob. 
"It is about the value of Bitcoin. BTC has no use now except to be speculated. So it is more like a ponzi scheme. It can go up to $50000 anyway, before it goes to $0. It is a craze but no one can tell you when it will end. Bitcoin Cash is like the original Bitcoin and can be used as a currency. That will give it uses and value

That is what people are saying here :)"
"You have to understand that this sub has lost their friggin minds.  They are in some delusional dream world.  They were hoping the 2x was going to ruin bitcoin and then they could step in and say that they are bitcoin now.

They all live in a sub called r/btc but they all dream of BCH.  This hasn't been a bitcoin sub in a long time.  They hate bitcoin.

I hope so.  That can happen some at least.  Everyone doesn't have to go down with the ship just because the path to scaling isn't exactly what you want.  I want Bitcoin to scale faster too, but I love Bitcoin and I am staying with it.

How does bigger blocksize cause more centralization exactly?
No the fork has been cancelled as per this pinned post. 
Sorry I just haven't heard the bull trap term before. What does that mean and which do you think is the trap? BTC or BCH?
Good idea if possible. 
"No, it doesn't, it enforces them. The rules are determined by the software. By your logic, 51% of the hash power can simply make 100 trillion coins, or set the difficulty to extremely low. That's not what miners do. They are rule enforces, the software dictates the rules and presently the most popular software is developed by the Bitcoin core devs. 

Rule changes are dictated by user consensus. If a new rule comes up and the community decides they like the rule, they install whatever software implements it.

If miners dictated the rules we'd be getting 2X. The fact that we aren't absolutely proves that they don't."
"Hopefully they add support for other coins as well. Would especially love to see XMR added.

But for sure they will have to do something, because their business model is incompatible with the Core coin that has now consolidated its position."
I’ve been following, but can someone ELI5 how all these companies, forks, core can be tied together into some conspiracy?
That would be a hard fork though.
"> Miners have the power. They have always had the power.

Lol.  Someone doesn't understand Bitcoin.

This situation is perfect proof.  90% of the miners wanted a change, yet where is it?  Where is the change?  The miners just showed their cards.  They are powerless.

It's all really simple.  Miners follow the value.  Say it with me, *""Miners follow the value.""*

The users determine the protocol rules via economic activity.  The fact that the 2x futures were trading so low was the only indicator the miners needed.  Miners cannot create value by switching chains.  If they would have left Bitcoin for the 2x chain, they would have lost millions of dollars a day in mining revenue.  They would have come crawling back to Bitcoin.

Miners cannot dictate protocol rules.  They either make valid block that **we** say are valid, or they go bankrupt.  It's their call."
"And if anybody posts anything positive about Bitcoin here in ""r/btc"" they get downvoted to oblivion, so don't complain about censorship at r/Bitcoin"
"> ""The community"" you mean censored forums like r/bitcoin where one company controls the message? 

No, I mean the economic community.  The community that gives Bitcoin it's >$7000 value.  That is who decides the protocol rules.  What miner is going to mine a SHA-256 coin worth less?

> Core is controlled by one company that pays them. 

The Core developer who is attributed with the most commits in the latest build, John Newbury, has absolutely no ties to Blockstream, and only entered the Bitcoin scene less than a year ago.

It seems you've been brainwashed to believe a narrative that simply isn't true.  It's sad really.  The truth is out there.  Get out of this echo-chamber and learn something."
"Should we feel dumb for being lied to and tricked?  You know which day everyone decided to not follow through with Segwit2x?  It was the day BCH went from around $300 to $600 and the insiders already knew they were backing out of 2x.  They front ran the markets and stole from their own supporters.

The markets went flying up weeks before a contentious hard fork that was expected to produce a single winner.  BTC ticker should have been going down and losing to alts.  Instead, money flows to BTC and Bitcoin Cash front running insider information."
Well said. Time to buy more cash
"You can find some info on the sticky FAQ here, the the question of why /r/btc has good links about the censorship. 

Also read about Dragon's Den. About Blockstream financial source. 

And, well, also this whole NY agreement.  It was a lie since the beginning, to get SegWit passed. 

There's much more. Keep around this sub for more info and eventually you'll see."
Yep. It was activated due to the NYA, and very quickly, after getting no more than 30% hashing support for months. It was to be Segwit first, then 2MB within 6 months. As predicted before anything happened, core would fight tooth and nail to stop the block size increase, and here we are. You don't compromise unless *both* sides get what they want *at the same time.* 
Know what malleability is? You know that BCH still has that problem? You get that this is a problem for the chain of trust in off chain scaling?
Sure possible, maybe some miner still will go with it, who knows. We find out in 1094 blocks.
What about the >90% miners signaling for it? That was quite an overwhelming majority.
Are we still talking about Bitcoin?
The other side wasn't better... https://twitter.com/lopp/status/919943125933707265
TIL what a Pyrrhic victory is, so... glass half full? 
">It's sad, but what have they really won?

The time to start coding again instead of trolling reddit all day?

Just kidding, they will continue trolling reddit."
The market was speaking very clearly.  There was not market demand for a contentious fork.
"It turns out that they like money.  That is good, because it is one of the safety checks for Bitcoin.  It's not great if the miners can change bitcoin in a way that the majority of the users oppose.  The market spoke and they listened.  This is how working for consensus should work.

Now, simply because a scaling approach you advocate has not been implemented on a timeline you approve, you do not need to abandon bitcoin.  Alt coins do not become bitcoin because of lower fees or any other perceived technical advantages.  Bitcoin is a decentralized project and it will not be all things to all people, but everyone doesn't get to have their own personal versions of Bitcoin.  There is only one Bitcoin."
Yeah, this is totally relevant to the fork.
Well put, gives a nice context on why S2X might not be off after all.
Until it's cancelled too. lol
Actually, you might want to reserve your judgement for a few days and cool down a bit. They pulled out of NYA, not necessarily S2X.
You speak of core as if it’s a couple of malicious and unreasonable dudes. It’s thousands of developers around the world. Sigh.
I will be very glad they reject 2x forever. 
It’s gonna be a massacre. Sha256 low fee vs sha256 high fee. No contest, knockout in round 3
It never was a community. It was a bunch of people who thought they had a common vision, but really there were two totally incompatible visions. Forking is the solution.
The community will unite again once a coin can act as a store of value, a spending currency.
"The community is united. That‘s why the madness of a contentious 2X hardfork was avoided. Yes, a group of chinese miners created a new altcoin (BCH), but Bitcoin is united and strong.
"
"Funny..?
I find it **interesting**.

Almost as if it was indicative of the fact that S2X might not need the NYA agreement to follow through. We'll see what happens; I don't think S2X will make any humungously large impact at this stage, but... we'll see."
Big boats take time to turn
The weak minded big blockers who caved made the decision 1-2 weeks ago in private encrypted chats.  They illegally front ran the market with insider information and hosed their base of supporters.  This front running began with the massive spike in BCH price.  That was the day it was decided.
Could you explain? I mean, you probably mean Bitcoin Cash but is there more to it?
if Bitcoin Unlimited had happened, all of this might have been avoided
It’s interesting because a lot of ecosystem is set up to handle Segwit2X already. So it would take minimal effort in regard to wallet and exchange adoption. However it would require significant hashrate to do this.
Whichever one is going, of course!
"what satoshi

what tweet"
And yet it was fine when Blockstream/Core presented it in HK 2 years ago. What changed?
"Sure you can - allow spending of existing segwit outputs but not creation of new ones. *Eventually* they'll all be gone...

And since you're only disallowing something that was previously valid, it's even a soft fork!"
"And the miners knew that other miners are just flags in the wind. If btc1x is 8000$ and btc2x is 2000$ (at same difficulty) all would mine btc1x.

Users are part of the consensus, if they pay more for one coin, miners will follow. That is by design."
IMHO, the community split is more due to censorship than it is due to code related issues.  I think if that went away, there's hope for reunification.  
"They specifically pulled out of a 2mb hard fork, which is the '2x' in S2X:

""it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time""

""we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade"""
"""The community"" you mean censored forums like r/bitcoin where one company controls the message? 

God you sheep just get more gullible and more brainwashed every day. 

Core is controlled by one company that pays them. Companies, like Blockstream, are controlled by governments. They have conflicts of interest.

""The community"" has been censored and banned at r/bitcoin.

Get your head out of the sand."
Thinking more deeply they might wait till after the HF on the 13th.
">  There was 0 reason to delay 2x by 3 months 

The code had to be ready and tested. And it clearly was not ready initially (see the bug fixes)."
Sure, but it can work with 1 megabyte for a while. Keep raising the fees and introduce a lightning network. Up the blocksize once everyone is using lightning networks, but not a large amount. Keep us dependent upon sidechains
"> it's not impossible, it just needs to be really thought through, with plenty of time for planning, testing and upgrading etc

You're new here aren't you."

"Fucking bullshit.

"> Core can keep all their toxic assholes.

Majority of core are actually quite good, it's the loud, obnoxious ones that you only hear from who are the real problems. The other guys, if you talk to them or go through the mailing list, are pretty reasonable and good."
"Yes, great article! Right at the beginning ""Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization)"". That is one of the oldest arguments and it was debunked several times.

Can you explain to me why you believe that onchain scaling doesn't work? Maybe do some reading about the [history](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) of the sub you got that information from."
Insider trading? lol 
"> No one ever listens to us.

It's sad, but it doesn't matter in the long run (even gives us an advantage). We have our coin with the properties we want. It still needs some work on the governance side, though. It's good we have some time until the masses wake up to the fact they bet on the wrong horse (or that there even *are* other horses to begin with)"
Because the forums where noobs go for information don't publish a certain *version* the history
what exactly blockstream has to do with NYA? I do not even like blockstream but wtf
We **think** it will be seamless. It’s *possible* that we’d be wrong. It’s important regardless. 
How the fuck are we united if we hang in different groups, subreddits and constantly insult each other. And I sure as fuck am not a Chinese miner.
Forking is a solution of course but the vision was common before Core changed the direction and most of the community decided that if the devs say so it must be correct.
I doubt that. I am not talking only about reddit. Some harsh words were said
"**Is Jihan Wu a double agent?**

Of the 6 Bitcoin traitors (The Pullout Six):

Mike Belshe

Wences Casares

Jeff Garzik

Peter Smith

Erik Voorhees

Jihan Wu

Jihan Wu is the only one with significant hash rate, he was the linchpin that could tip the balance, yet this was his second time refusing to pull the trigger at the last minute to increase the block size.

A controlled opposition is someone who looks exactly like an activist, gathers all the opposing force then bail out at the last minute, like the Catatonia independence movement.

These 6 traitors just pulled a Catatonia, Mike Belshe and Jeff Garzik are obvious double agents, the question is, is Jihan Wu also a controlled opposition, or was he under duress, did he know all along or was he threatened or bribed somewhere along the way?

Why did Jihan Wu pull out of the Hong Kong Agreement, Bitcoin Unlimited, New York Agreement at the last minute?

He was the only person with real hash rate, if Jihan wanted small blocks he could have stayed quiet 3 times, if Jihan wanted big blocks he could have stayed the course 3 times.

Why is it always Jihan Wu that looked like an opposition then pull out at the last minute?

Why is Jihan Wu so quiet about being screwed again?

Why is there no noise on taking back Segwit support once the agreement failed?

This isn't the first time so you can't pretend this is another accident.

"Long time holder of btc.

Bitcoin Cash is first I wanted to sell.

I think some quackery is going on rather than actual demand."
Because the real intention was for the miners to sack (disempower) the core development team at any cost. Users and a lot of businesses didn't like that, even if they supported a small increase in block size. Hence the resistance to the fork.
If it actually caught on and relieved the network, the bubble would burst and they wouldn't make as much profit as they are now with the main chain.
Yeah. Right now, the whole thing stinks.

"Read the same post elsewhere. Will give it some days/weeks before making up my mind; so far things are too uncertain."
gotmad, you raise a good point, has anyone explained why it was cancelled when blocks were signalling over 85% support for S2X ?
Quite simply, they didn't have the stones.
Maybe because users have shown they don't want it? 
This! (No more need to hedge with a BTC holding. All in on Bitcoin Cash!)
No, thank YOU.
They make money on your money. 
It's more about the timeline than the size.  There is majority support for a blocksize increase at some point via hardfork rolled in with other upgrades.  Many would like to give some time for SegWit and Lightning to have impact and then look toward more onchain scaling on a timetable with more consensus.  Very few developers thought the 2x timeframe was wise.  It wasn't simply developers supported by Blockstream.
"That's why I said fork. 
If you can see it's not gonna be an upgrade because you don't have consensus then it is your responsibility to ensure your fork doesn't damage both chains."
Man, why the hate ?
"Have you read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)? The thing that started it all? Bitcoin Cash is much closer to it than Bitcoin Core. ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""."

Without enough support NYA is DOA, difficulty will kill it. Signalling is already down to 60% and market already gave upper hand to B1X so I don't see it.
Still, nobody on this sub has been able to explain to me WHAT makes Bitcoin Cash the original Bitcoin?? Which is just not true, considering Bitcoin came out first. Lol
Fresh account warning.
"Its incredibly frustrating reading this sub and seeing so many people simply dismissing bitcoin and trying to say that BCH is now bitcoin, it isn't.

I like watching NBA basketball.  My favorite team is the Warriors.  OKC is mad because they can't seem to beat the Warriors.  It's as if OKC one day decides we want to be the NBA champs, so from now on we're going to say ""We're the Warriors now!   So from now on call us the Warriors, and one day soon we'll be the champs!""

Do you see how stupid that is?  It doesn't work like that.  I don't have a favorite team in crypto nescessarily, I just like to make money from crypto.  Bitcoin is/was the first, and led the way for ALL of these other cryptos.  That's where my fondness for it comes from.  It has proven to be successful, i.e. make money. 

 When I was buying BTC last year for $1600, I thought I was crazy, as did any of my friends I told about it.  Now the shits over 7k, wow.  I saw ETH moving in January.  I moved my modest little chunk of BTC into ETH and almost made 10x on my investment in a few months.  I left a job I hated, paid my bills for a good 6 months, bought a car for a step daughter, and took my girl friend on a fantastic all expense paid vacation.  It was awesome.

Now here I am again, with a modest little chunk of ETH, while BTC went up 2k while I was on vacation.  I'm about to move my ETH back into BTC in the next day or so, whenever this dust settles.

I read r/btc  (among others) to glean a little insight as to what these cryptos are doing. Namely,  bitcoin.  Now that this sub is anti bitcoin, and all in BCH it annoys me to no end.  Not because of BCH in general, but because this sub wants to call themselves bitcoin, it isn't.  There are many versions of bitcoin, none of them are bitcoin, and none are number one on coinmarket cap, bitcoin is.

There's money in these cryptos, and we can all make some.  OKC isn't the Warriors, and BCH isn't bitcoin.  Let's all move on and try to make some money together; this isn't basketball, and there doesn't have to be one champion.  BCH should worry about BCH, hell it practically doubled the last 2 weeks while I was away.  I would have loved to have been in on that.  I can read coinmarketcap daily and look at all of the 30% gainers in a single day.  I wished I had some of thay action too!

Anyways.... enough of the rant and good luck kids.  Spare me the we're going to change the world stuff.  While I appreciate the sentiment and agree to an extent. That's a LOOONNGG way off.  So in the mean time, lets make money!"
Negligible likelihood of anything going wrong. 
"You guys are hilarious..

You might want to spend some time looking at the old bitcoin videos, listen to the old podcasts and read the old articles. Like, things from 2012-2014.

It should be educational as to what value proposition bitcoin grew on, and help build an idea as to what's happening now."
bigger blocks dont. Too big blocks do.
"It really doesn't, at least not to an problematic extent. Many people who come from Core's idea of what Bitcoin is seem to think that every network participator should have to run a full node on their system (validates transactions and keeps the blockchain on the system), however this was never part of the initial design. It's a bit like asking every mail user to run their own mail/SMTP servers to send mails.

If blocksize increases the blockchain gains weight more quickly. Full 8MB blocks would on average take up 1 GB of space per day, which accumulates over time. This is however no issue for Bitcoin businesses and miners, as they could easily pay the increased costs for nodes. There is simply no reason for the average Bitcoin user to require these storage capacities, as they can simply use SPV wallets.

There are some more centralization arguments about this topic, however they don't make much sense. There is Moore's law and research on the way to heavily improve Bitcoin node performance.

Having less privately run nodes (by end users) on the network does technically decrease ""decentralization"" if only Bitcoin businesses who need to run a full node do so, however the network was never meant to be ""100%"" decentralized. There is a point where the decentralization for the network is good enough to prevent shutdowns or takeovers. SPV wallets are perfectly fine, so even if you don't run a full node your funds are safe and you can transact with them without issues. If Bitcoin wants to replace fiat you cannot require every user of the network to run a node to use the network. That's simply not realistic."

"But that's exactly the catch. By allowing this behaviour you're effectively giving the minority (I disregard if this was the case here or not) the power over the majority by being a dick and pushing a simple upgrade into a fork.

* Example 1:
If a minority wants to fork (e.g. BCH or BTG) then sure, they need to implement replay protection, which both BCH and BTG did.

* Example 2:
If a majority* wants to upgrade there is no need for replay protection, the minority that does not want to upgrade has to fork off (e.g. BCH on Aug 1st).

*: How ever majority is measured... it's kind of unclear with S2X because it did/will not happen.

* Example 3:

Downvotes are not censorship. 
So long as BTC hodlers are willing to pay ridiculous fees, it will go much, much higher.
A block size increase didn't happen on its own (though I believe it would have eventually activated) so there was no reason to believe it would just because a handful of people signed a piece of paper.
"Maybe this is me over-rationalizing, but I think the separation was deliberate. The obvious reason is to show good faith, by giving enough time for the ecosystem to upgrade.

The other less obvious, but very important is that miners/other large companies might have wanted a way to see if there *was* a way to compromise with core. By rejecting s2x, they (I don't say we, because I've known for a while now) that core is ready to sabotage bitcoin and act in bad faith to preserve their stranglehold on bitcoin.

I would have said that this would be very foolish **if** Bitcoin Cash didn't exist. But it seems to make so much sense now. Core has been more publicly exposed for the scum that they are, and miners/large actors have had time to amass massive amounts of BCH.

Developments post BCH DA fork should be very interesting."

"**Is Jihan Wu a double agent?**

Of the 6 Bitcoin traitors (The Pullout Six):

Mike Belshe

Jeff Garzik

Jihan Wu

Jihan Wu is the only one with significant hash rate, he was the linchpin that could tip the balance, yet this was his second time refusing to pull the trigger at the last minute to increase the block size.

A controlled opposition is someone who looks exactly like an activist, gathers all the opposing force then bail out at the last minute, like the Catatonia independence movement.

These 6 traitors just pulled a Catatonia, Mike Belshe and Jeff Garzik are obvious double agents, the question is, is Jihan Wu also a controlled opposition, or was he under duress, did he know all along or was he threatened or bribed somewhere along the way?

Why did Jihan Wu pull out of the Hong Kong Agreement, Bitcoin Unlimited, New York Agreement at the last minute?

He was the only person with real hash rate, if Jihan wanted small blocks he could have stayed quiet 3 times, if Jihan wanted big blocks he could have stayed the course 3 times.

Why is it always Jihan Wu that looked like an opposition then pull out at the last minute?

Also It's really great that bitcoin cash has much lower tx fees, but cant this only last as long as transaction demand is that much lower too? One might imagine that as Bitcoin Cash becomes more popular and starts becoming adopted as a currency, that transaction demand will rise and price along with it. "

"What do we mean by ""stopped""? Personally I think many people misunderstand what Bitcoin has become. Bitcoin *is* crypto-currency, it is a concept, it is the future, and above all it is the market that gives massive returns to investors. The money piling in now doesn't care what Bitcoin is, how 'usable' it is, how it scales, its philosophy, etc. We all get frustrated because BTC is not what was originally imagined and designed but it has become something else. BTC die-hards will continue to misinterpret (and espouse the ludicrous narrative) that BTC price is some kind of validation of their approach, and that the market wants a 'store of value' etc and we might have to live with that. But who cares, get over it. Scaling will be provided eventually, by one or more coins (not BTC clearly) and the dream will start to happen, whether BTC is around or not. A strong BTC that gives way over time to more useful currency might be the best thing for everyone - long live Bitcoin! (I'm will not buy BTC though :)"

So far, they haven't solved (in code, practically) how to allow a user to use funds from one channel inside another, and they haven't solved the centralization forces that creats a hub network rather than a mesh network.

As long as it remains a hub network, the hubs will get regulated and start to spy on and censor users.

"RemindMe! 2 years ""bch off chain scaling""

Honestly, I don't think BCH will ever get off chain scaling. BCH is the miners backup plan against off chain scaling (that's why they mined it at a loss). I'm rather sure they will not accept a fork that adds off chain scaling. But lets see.

I am actually ready to bet 1 btc that in 2 years BCH will not have off chain scaling support. Or you want more years for a bet?"
"A hard fork is a forward only update, so any un-upgraded nodes are dropped off because they violate majority consensus rules basically

A soft fork is essentially also backward compatible with older nodes, but is not the way Bitcoin was designed to update, and this takes away some of the voting rights of miners as well. Generally this should only ever be done in an emergency, like patching a 0-day exploit until a proper hard fork is implemented.

Hard forks never used to be scary, Core just played it up that way to justify implementing SegWit as a soft-fork so they can remain in control of future updates."

When they canceled the fork a lot of people that dropped a lot of other reinvestment the past few weeks (alts mostly) went.. Well fuck I ain't getting my free money. And because a lot of traders believe other traders think just like them they expect other people to sell If their own primary reason was the fork. "

Consensus for changes of the Bitcoin rules needs to be established between developers, miners, exchanges, merchants and wallet providers. The way B2X went down was another perfect example for that. Hashrate does not dictate change of the rules. This balance of power between devs, miners, exchanges, merchants and wallet providers is the true genius of Satoshi Nakamoto.

This is a cryptocurrency only idea. If you venture into any other technical community, a single developer working alone on something is rarely frowned upon. Its only in Bitcoin where people argue the bigger team is the better it is. Most protocols are developed by one person.

If a miner moves over to BCH, the difficulty shoots up, and it becomes much less profitable. That's why I'm saying it would be suicide to switch. "
No would it make a good oration?
You think miners can boycott a chain with absolutely no community support behind them?
Miners follow the money. In order to split one miner has to specifically mine a large block and most other miners has to follow. This will not happen. Even if the miners have s2x aware code they just won't activate it otherwise their miners will mine blocks that the network continuously discard because a s2x aware miner will still follow the longest chain.

AFAIK, there is no evidence of ""closed"" or ""secret"" channels, so it seems like you're trying to sow a bit of FUD, or am I mistaken?"
"BU was more like S2X in that it was, as I understand it, meant to replace btc and become btc. (Two chains competing for relevance under one coin.) Bitcoin Cash forked with replay protection, making it a separate coin. Whether he thinks that that makes BCH inferior to BU is irrelevant. The point is that it is possible that it makes this situation different enough that he would **not be hypocritical** to not dump all his btc for BCH. (He's said specifically that he thinks putting all your eggs in one basket is a bad idea when in comes to cryptocurrencies.)


And just for the record, I'm really not **that interested** in what Roger says or does. I just don't like it when people on the internet try to use bad logic to prove a point."
I personally know of people who altruistically mine so you are wrong. They also use it to heat their house. These people are not profitable, without gambling on future price.  These people are still miners.
"the btc1 repository doesn't have s2x aware code; they have s2x enforcing code."
"Naw I'm pretty sure mods IM each other sometimes and so on. I'm not trying to FUD as I'm pretty content with how this sub is moded. 

The constant downvotes for unpopular opinions even if they're demonstrably true is an issue though. Most subs suffer from that though."
"So they reject blocks that are less than 1 mb?

Or what do you mean?"
So you're saying people who have similar interests sometimes have private conversations? ok
Yes. Fork block must be > 1mb.
Yes that's exactly what I'm saying.
Right but if the fork block becomes part of the shorter chain because s2x don't have the mining majority then the s2x miners will switch to the longer chain leaving the fork block as an orphan. This will probably cause a cycle of the s2x miners trying to build large blocks on top of the longest chain and getting orphaned over and over again costing them a ton of money. I don't see that happening.
The btc1 clients will not switch to the longer chain if the longer chains block at the specificied block height is less than or equal to 1MB.
"You can't just build a large block on top of the s1x chain - the FIRST block of the btc1 fork must be large, and that block has a set height. The chain is forced to split at that block height.

However, I suspect the value of the Save the Chain TX (>250btc) might cause some temptation to try to orphan other miner's initial blocks."

""And if you have an opinion on this as to which version of bitcoin is the better one let's say it does wind up that there's two chains I'll tell you, I will sell my coins on the slow expensive core chain and use the proceeds from that, if I'm even able to get my coins in a confirmation block to get it to an exchange, but that'll probably be really difficult because the network fees will be so high and there will be so little hashrate on that chain, but if that were even possible to do I would sell those coins, use the proceeds to buy more of the useful bitcoins because Bitcoin Unlimited coin is going to be so much more useful because you'll actually be able to send and receive them with people, unlike the Bitcoin Core coins on this congested network that'll take forever and cost a fortune to move the Bitcoins.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpOnolf1tS8&feature=youtu.be&t=23m9s

He doesn't say **all** his coins, though you **could argue** that that's what he's implying. Even still, he's also talking about Bitcoin Unlimited and the video was uploaded to youtube on 3/20/2017, so this is long before Bitcoin Cash, and the upgrade to Bitcoin Unlimited's block size was going to be very different from the way Bitcoin Cash forked Bitcoin. Given that, I think that this source is, at best, half relevant. It would be a good source to provide if Roger said ""I didn't sell all my btc"", and you wanted to ask Roger himself what exactly changed, if anything, since he made that video.

All you see is someone propose a bet to make with Roger Ver, to which Roger never responds. Apparently, someone did try to pose as Roger Ver, which is why this reply was added:

>post made by btc_broker not roger

>= roger not even making a bet

>im guessing in 2 minutes the reddit trolls will make some big deal about how roger made a bet and the renigged

>or how roger instigated a bet

>or how roger asked for a bet

>any troll can make a post asking for a free house and a asian wife.. doesnt mean they will get it.

>making this topic pointless

So... it's completely irrelevant. Why did you link me to it?"
"This conversation isn't about show, and your analogy doesn't hold up anyway. This conversation is about whether minorman trusts Roger Ver to **keep his word**, to which he replied ""yes"", to which OverkilllerSRB replied ""Just like he sold all of his btc"" which **implies that Roger Ver made a promise to do so**, which is why I asked when he made such a promise. As far as I can tell, he never did."

""Partnering"" with nChain was probably the biggest mistake the BU devs could have ever made."
"Hilarious but totally unnecessary.

If you want your points to be accepted, stay away from as hominem attacks."
The trolls are here. I expected more.
He says he’ll sell his coins on the slow core chain, which apparently is BTC. And why should it apply to BU & not BCH? Does roger see BCH As inferior to BU then?

The top moderator spot for /r/BTC was given to me 100% for free by someone else who shares Satoshi's vision. 
To say Roger hasn't contributed much to bitcoin is simply not true.  He was one of the first people to recognize bitcoin's potential and spread the word to the masses. In the early days, he promoted bitcoin, like no other. He didn't earn the name Bitcoin Jesus for nothing! Like him or hate him, you cannot deny that his influence helped propel the crypto community to where it is today. 
"> though he hasn't contributed much of anything to Bitcoin. 

You're talking very tough, big boy. How about you, tell us your contributions to Bitcoin. If any?"
"Nice to see the retards here voting you down for truth. 

Lets look at the facts. 

He's not done anything to contribute to bitcoin that doesn't benefit him, all he talks about is economics. He's a good guy to get on a show, he appears confident, uses weasel words, and puts his point across well, just like any good politician, its all lies and deceit. 

Bought bitcoin.com, its a business, not a reference site. Pushes it heavily on this sub. 

Runs r/btc like its an extension of bitcoin.com, same styles, links to ""official bitcoin.com links"". Check his post history, few comments in his own threads, mostly just pumping his site or coin. 

Nearly all the links in the sidebar are linked to Ver. Either his own site, or companies he has invested in. 

Has an advert masquerading as a link in the sidebar (link to his pool, in not sure if this should really be allowed on Reddit?).

Refuses to list the core bitcoin client in his ""nodes"" list, despite the fact that something like 75% of the network runs it.  Instead links very niche (sub 1% of the network) clients. Which can conveniently run BCH. 

Constantly promotes his own site and domain, thus us actually against the reddit content guidelines for posting. This sub is nothing but SEO and backlinks to his site. 

Denounces ad hominem attacks in bitcoin. Attacks other people. "
Just like he sold all of his btc and gox was fine, right?
Absolutely true that it's none of our business. But then what credibility should we attach to him publically announcing that he made a 4m bch bet. What is the purpose/intention of announcing that if he's not going to show he truly is materially invested in bch as a project and not just using it to manipulate the btc price.
"He doesn't have to do anything. But if he wants to prove his actions match his words, he should convert all his Segwit BTC to Bitcoin Cash. Until then, he's betting both ways.
"
To drum up demand for BCH so he can make money. 
">He took away support from BU

Thank God. The EC model implemented in BU is fundamentally broken, and their team is now openly controlled by nChain -- which just might be the only thing worse than a team pseudo-controlled by Blockstream."
Suicide? 
If the new DAA succeeds in ensuring persistent approximate profitability parity, this will indeed make it feasible to mine Bitcoin Cash exclusively without significant opportunity cost.
He keeps saying this but he won't sell Bitcoin
We are all here for the same damn reason, *personal* enrichment. Roger owes it to himself to do what is best for his interests.
What a load of bull shit. 
Bye Roger, been fun watching you from a distance!
defaulting to bitcoin cash would suffice.
"Ver should promote both because they are both Bitcoin. Together they fulfill Satoshi's vision. Online stores should immediately switch to accepting Bitcoin Cash, and that will take the Tx pressure off Bitcoin and boom - Bitcoin scaling debate is moot. Bitcoin Cash = medium of exchange (like cash). Bitcoin (Legacy for want of a better word) = store of value (like gold). Everyone wins this way - much like when Steve Jobs invited Microsoft's Bill Gates to present MS Office at MacWorld. The cash injection from Microsoft saved Job's career and likely saved Apple.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash = stronger together doing what they respectively do best. (just call me ""Steve"" hehe)
I invest in both as they are both great in their own way. Ver should take the blinkers off. If he does this, he might regain some respect within the greater crypto community."

So he's made a few statements that give us an indication of how he's been playing the scenario, in terms of BTC and BCH trading."

I know what it means in that context. I was hoping you'd elaborate with something that had a little more substance. Perhaps some evidence?
"> I'm happy, this company can lie to me all day long.

You are making a fool of yourself."
"> Id prefer a company like his gradually guide their users 

Yeah, this was truly Satoshi's Vision™© ® "
Sure but if I was a BCH supporter and Ver assured me that his company would stand behind BCH, I'd be fucking pissed if he bailed.  The way I see it, Roger has no choice but to follow through with his statement or fade into obscurity.  He's burned too many bridges.
Yes, as in deliberately kill your own business. 
"There are still enough Bcash dead-enders for a few more good laughs.

""We still believe in you, Bcash Jesus"" they bleat (some on the very thread)."
Nah mate it wasn't a transaction it was a smart contract that was affected by a bug that needs to be rectified and when it is squashed the smart contract will be functional once again.
You have no idea what you are talking about.
"He's said its ""stupid to sell all your bitcoins"", so I don't expect him personally not to hedge.   It doesn't mean he won't pivot fully to BCH on bitcoin.com."
"Such an event needs to be digested first.

Give him time. He will make his voice heard."
+1, if he doesn't follow through he's a bitch.
He answered me on some of regular nonsense posts here.  Didn’t even have to ask.
He has his personal secretary doing the Reddit chores for him.
Except if BCH can do smaller transactions better than bitcoin can it can store and transmit large value better also making BTC irrelevant.
"Fair question, and one many grapple with. The reality is that so long as blocks stay small and thus the blockchain growth is small, then BTC will be a better store of value than BCH. Over time once BCH gets multi-terabyte blockchain and is several orders of magnitude bigger than the BTC blockchain, people will be nervous about the long-term viability of BCH and be drawn to store funds in BTC as a safer option.

Also for BCH to really take off as ""cash"" then it needs to maintain a fairly stable value. Otherwise it'll be a victim of its own ""success"" and people will want to horde BCH and use another crypto for buying and selling. Read up on Gresham's Law for a more in-depth discussion of this.
"
It's strategically was best to keep his BTC until after the fork. If the original chain survived he could have dumped the coin to crash the price.
When did he say he sold (or would sell) all his btc?
BTC and BCH are both good for different uses. We should embrace both. I am like Steve Jobs bringing waring parties together.  kthnxbi
"If he lost he would never tell you.

"that stops ETH being inmutable Visa/paypal cancel transactions everyday for the trust  of crypto this is a problem.

Extremely so. BCH is risky and Ver would never jeopardize his current economic position. He's all talk.

I wish Erik would show more support for Bitcoin Cash. He understands Bitcoin needs to scale, but he just can’t let go of BTC even now when it’s no longer useful...
Yeah, sorry you had a poor experience with them. I've had a few failed shifts myself which is frustrating, but I ended up getting all my coins back.  My point remains about the fees though. 
"and he did. the HF coin is called bitcoin cash, and its available on shapeshift.io. again, wtf are you even asking for?

Uhm, SG2x was literally a public fork away from Core. What am I not getting? That he signed the email cancelling it?
He probably thinks segwit will somehow increase capacity. This isn't even false.
It's because these people have no fucking clue what they are doing. They have no idea what is going on. Core outplays them every time because they haven't realised that bitcoin is now a political system, and to win you have to play political games. They will lose every time until they realise this.
">they will try again and again and again

"I didn't get coins 3 times I tried to use shapeshift a couple months ago, had about $20-30 in ""fees"" to basically hold my coins hostage for a couple days. I tried through coinomi the first time, the 2nd through the official shapeshift app then once on the website with ""precise"" mode. Absolute crap. And I contacted their support if anyone is curious, they said and I quote ""The discrepancy you're referring to is the 0.002 BTC miner fee used to send funds from ShapeShift to you.  This is not a ShapeShift fee, it is the fee required to process transactions on the blockchain.  The miner fee is required any time ShapeShift sends fees, whether it's the exchange withdrawal or the refund of a failed exchange.  You agreed to this fee when you accepted the ShapeShift Terms of Service.  Your exchange failed because the amount you sent was over the deposit limit.  The limits are on every Quick Exchange order page.  These limits are dynamic and change with the price changes every 30 seconds.  If you find it difficult to make deposits within the limit parameters, you're welcome to use a Precise Exchange and designate the deposit amount before you send your funds."" Which is fine but the two apps I listed above didn't have any information about,""Deposit limits"" and the third attempt was well within their parameters."

"if shapeshift supported BCH without bias all my friends would be able to convert BTC to BCH using the shapeshift app on the iPhone.

"Are there any examples in history where it worked out this way? I think one Point in which modern society is an improvement to archaic ones is how it can handle conflicts and change without bloodshed. Institutional change is a fairly modern concept. Every ""revolution"" gives power to people which aren't capable of handling it, just as Bitcoin seems to centralizes ist power around the big players in the market which can use their money to run FUD campaigns, incentivize behind the scenes, so that the origin idea is slowly becoming nothing more than a semantic in this game of power. It's just my guess as a social scientist that this is the way BTC is heading right now and it's only possible because the trust in technology to solve all problems of inequallity alone and without institutional governance is a rather shortsighted idea. It has to be flanked by institutional frameworks to work properly. 

Btw.: I base my judgement not on single social philosophers and theoretical ideas. But I'd like to see - empirically - how this whole thing will play out. Maybe I will be proven wrong and a new utopia will thrive. But probability's not really on the side of dreamers. ;-)"

He has, to the extent he cares to do it. He's probably not doing it to the exclusion of other cryptos (bitcoin included), but why would you expect anyone, let alone a businessman whose main business deals with exchanging cryptos, to pledge allegiance to anything you personally think is best?

Seriously man, you read like every bit of a zealot as those Core supporters you so despise. Perhaps it's time for you to reflect on this and WTF you're doing by demanding these things of people who owe nothing to you."

He's publicly taken many dumps on Bitcoin Cash and pledged eternal support to Bitcoin Core. Does not sound much like a 180° to me, or even anything resembling what he promised to do February 2016.

For a start, he can apologize, and admit he was dead fucking wrong, and then start pulling that 180° and reinvest in bitcoin to have at least skin in the game, and then take regular dumps on Bitcoin Core for a change. And that wouldn't even begin to get him into good graces hereabouts. He'll have to work pretty hard and long on that one before he's got a shred of integrity recovered."
"He has on many occasion denounced and taken a dump on bitcoin cash. Now he's pledging eternal allegiance to Bitcoin Core. It's time to confess, recant and do penance. It's time for him to apologize, admit the errors of his ways, denounce Bitcoin Core and publicly start supporting Bitcoin Cash any way he can. It's the only serious fork away from Bitcoin Core, and he pledged to support that, publicly.

That pledge still stands, or does it come with an expiry date of:

Honestly, not quite sure what you want from him. Is he not offering some institutional support that I'm unaware of?
Yeah. Miners who signed the NYA should stop processing SegWit transactions until the block size is raised via hard fork in order to keep to the spirit of the NYA, which is the only reason SegWit is active at all.
rather depressing.

Not before getting a hodl on some Cash first, obv.
Hey Erik, what are you waiting for? Come over to ETH its going to overtake and turn btc into myspace someday anyway
Maybe he realized you don't change the system by playing against it but making the system more transparent and fair? I've never understood all the FUD against companies like Ripple trying to improve the monetary system instead of contradicting it. I mean, working together with players like the Gates Foundation will possibly do more good than this whole aimless endeavour which - for the lack of guidance - has become the playingfield for big monetary players using political and social semantics for their own good. This whole movement is on the brink of freeing people from banks and delivering them to even more ruthless forces and political mudslinging. Deeply ironic. 
"> that forced 99% of the world's population to keep using banks.

Wow. Get your head out of your ass. I dont think even half the worlds population has access to banks. And if the very poor chose to keep using banks still, its probably because BTC/BCH/anyotherufckingcryptocurrency requires a fucking internet connection and a smartphone at the very least. Majority of worlds population DOES NOT have access to that. Want to help'em out? I think dogecoin is a better subreddit for you."
The irony, as shapeshift does literally that.

Interesting how we're against banks, whilst Mike Hearn (an important former Bitcoin dev) is against Core ( https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7 ) and works on Corda ( https://www.corda.net/ ), which in turn is much used by banks ...
"Still no word from /u/evoorhees on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bntyk/okay_bitcoin_cash_is_ready_are_you_ready_erik/) (posted 21 hours ago) despite him being [online on reddit just just now](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bt0ao/erikvoorhees_enjoy_segwit_eric_lombrozo_segwit/dpkuf3s/).

Erik, Bitcoin Cash is ready, are you [ready](https://i.redd.it/mybewqdy1twz.jpg)? Or is it for you just talk the talk but never walk the walk? I guess moaning about transaction fees on twitter is cheaper than actually doing something (bitcoin cash) to solve the problem eh? [Roger is ready](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bopq0/okay_bitcoin_cash_is_ready_are_you_ready_roger/dpk9hh8/)...

And the self-righteous attitude of Lombrozo, bordering on religious zeal, is sad. Despite his victory, he keeps insulting and gloating over people on the other side of the debate. What an idiot.
"This is spot on.

Small blocker don’t realize they are fighting to prevent Bitcoin to the disruptive tech tech of this century.. for what tulips??"
Welcome back, Erik.
Erik talks a good talk and seems to know in his heart what is right, but hasn't backed his words with action.
"> segwit is available to slash everyone's fees,

even with 100pct adoption fees are out of control, this is such an ignorant thing to say, infuriating. "
But Segwit doesn't have much of an effect, even if it is 100% adopted. Is the plan to wait 36 months for LN, and then use that instead of Bitcoin? 😐
"> Erik is changing his tune

no tune has been changed"
His most recent tweet: “im glad segwit activated at least”
"> I prefer to have my own

That's not a Bitcoin then. Bitcoin is about a way to find consensus between people with different ""owns"". Nakamoto consensus reigns supreme"
"> It's a living, developing, evolving system

Two chains, two models are fighting right now. One will win"
The moral of this story? Civil war.
I lodled at this.
It's all a matter of faith
Did you get a good price?
The only person in the world who in 2008, had the sheer breadth but also the specificity of knowledge
"No brain here, who is it? 



^^exactly"
Exactly why we need to cut them all off and move onto BitcoinCash
Everybody with a brain knows exactly who Satoshi is
exactly bro I'm tired of hearing about how the miners should not have so much control. If you don't like that become a miner. Its not hard
"MINERS ARE THE ONLY USERS THAT MATTER. MINERS ARE THE ENTIRE NETWORK... FUCK THE MONEY BECAUSE THERE IS NO BITCOIN WITHOUT MINERS. FUCK YOUR  FEEINGS BECAUSE THERE IS NO BITCOIN WITHOUT MINERS. FUCK YOUR PROFITS, AND YOUR BUSINESES AND YOUR EVERYTHING BECUASE BITCOIN IS NOTHING WITHOUT MINERS.

IF YOU CANT EVEN RUN A FUCKING NODE  FUCKOFF DIE IN A FIRE YOU ARE NOT AN EARLY ADOPTER AND YoU DO NOT DESERVE ANY SAY IN GOVERNAnCE... Simple as that"
Nope.
That's insane. Bitcoin was supposed to stop crap like this.
"This was done because I run another service called AnonSteem. Moving the Bitcoins after receiving them costs me out the ass, it severely chews into the profit and thus I have to raise the price for Bitcoin users.

Thanks to this, I applied a $10 surcharge on Privex to any person crazy enough to pay with Bitcoin.

**Example:** The average transaction for AnonSteem is 0.004 BTC (now $30), which means sending 0.40 BTC ($3000) is around 100 inputs.

This can result in a transaction fee of an astonishing $50 to $100 (0.01 BTC, 2.5% of the tx) if I want it confirmed within a *FEW DAYS*.

**It can be $300-400 (0.04 BTC, 10% of the whole transaction) if I want it confirmed within a day**

This is a real example of me extracting profits from the AnonSteem Bitcoin addresses from a few months ago: https://i.imgur.com/ZSdpwp7.png - note this is after setting it to very low fees, and it would take about 4-5 days to confirm.

>(4400 / 1.7) * 0.05 BTC = $130 fee"
I've responded to the user.
"I think you need to come away from anon steem and look at a POS conversion if you’re not prepared to hold bitcoin for your company. 

You could always hold the bitcoin as capital? It doesn’t make sense to argue in favour of high fees because you want to use your own company anonsteem. "
Thanks for the name mention. I've made a comment onto the post itself here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7awpft/the_state_of_bitcoin_in_one_image/dpkyir5/

"I'm the CEO of [Privex Inc.](https://www.privex.io) (the screenshot is from our invoice system) and was the one to make the decision for this surcharge.

"He definitely is far from alone on this.  The next month or two could be huge for BCH.

Also, this guy looks like Dwight Shrute with an eye patch in his twitter picture."
Stop talking from your ass if you're trying to be condescending.
Sorry my bad I think I'm thinking of Peter Sunde
"That's not what they're saying.

Good for you that you finally bought back in though. You were very public about selling when you called Bitcoin ""overvalued"" (I think at about $100?)."
"> Bank accounts are awful.

Right, hence 95% of my net worth being in crypto and 4% being in cash.

I can still recognize that using bitcoin for things it is not YET useful for is stupid. I can recognize that no matter how many times I use it for something it's not useful for, it doesn't make it any more useful for that.

"
Then it will be very expensive to acquire bitcoin. 5%+ in fees on localbitcoins trading cash for bitcoin. 1%+ if you get paid in bitcoin. Further proving how irrelevant miner fees are in the equation. 
"Nah I've heard these selling points since 2012. I share the same long term vision. But then I'm also aware of the current reality, which is that using bitcoin to buy a legal good does nothing for me and I'd rather use fiat. For one, I'd rather spend the inflationary money that is guaranteed to be worth less tomorrow than it was worth today. Second, I'd rather not deal with the hassle and costs of acquiring bitcoin for the sake of doing something I can do with my credit card just fine.

I too opt out of fiat. 95% of my net worth is in crypto.  If you wanna opt out of traditional payment systems for a greater good, I applaud you. But if you think having your coffee purchase settled worldwide on a decentralized global ledger is gonna be a practical experience for you, then you are simply a fool. "
"Yeah? What about it? It would mean a good amount of people are willing to spend $50 to send bitcoin, clearly. If that's too much of a fee for me to use it for things I use it for, then I wouldn't use it for those things anymore of course. But again, clearly, it would mean people are doing things with bitcoin that they find worthy of spending $50 to do it. That would mean using bitcoin has > $50 of value to those persons willing to pay that. It would mean that the network could likely depend on miner fees to pay for the operating costs of a global decentralized network that uses a great deal of electricity. 

This is all pretty straightforward stuff, but I wasn't sure where you were going with this rhetorical question. "
"It's great for anything that credit cards and banks aren't good for.

In time it will be better than credit cards and banks for all things. "
"It's too bad we won't be able to comment in this thread in 5 years because of the age limit of Reddit posts.

In 5 years when you come back here and you see this, post a new thread. Probably I will have switched accounts by then but I'm just a bystander in this conversation anyway so w/e."

What is your problem, sir? No reason to be offensive. Have you ever tried to work? Honest work? Earning money? Taking responsibility? Either you're too young or too broken and you see your big chance in life with..... DA BITCOIN, DA COIN WHICH WILL TAKE FROM DA RICH AND GIVET TO DA POOR! :D
Greed
Ryan air :p
Would probably also be faster.
So...you're hedging BTC with assets that you just said will also crash if BTC crashes?
You think it could be bubbly if it sounds bubbly ?
Iceland is a fail state, it does not count
He's a founder of Piratpartiet, not The Pirate Bay.
Yes, that parrot on your shoulder is expensive to maintain.
Some people like to assert this. I don't really know what they get out of saying I don't have a comfortable retirement fund, when _my_ numbers say I do.
"Well that's another boat in which you are not alone. 
I also bought  bitcoin in 2011 - and lost some on mtgox (about 15% of my total).  Lesson learnt in counterparty risk (Tether anyone??).

Cheers!"
You are fucking retarded. Bank accounts are awful. Bitcoin made them obselete. Fuck off back to visa while we taste freedom.
What if I don't have a bank account? It's not illegal not to have a bank account, you know.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean? It's not even a state. The only failed state is the United States. 
Sounds dutchy 
Not quite. I think crypto can have a future but I don't think it can without bitcoin so I'm hedging the alts with BTC, not the other way around. If the whole thing collapses then it's all gone and I don't have a hedge for that, but I've made sure to put no more than the amount of money that I can afford to lose into crypto. Hope that makes sense.
You could also send a trezor by mail
When it comes to BitcoinCore's incompetent implementation, miner fees are the biggest fees I pay to take in money — *by far*.
"...and here it comes, the good ol' ad hominem (read about it, if you must). 

Sorry, Sir, I'm out. Wish you good luck for you and your family!

ongoing, don't worry
"> you could get paid in crypto.

And give up 1% of my paychecks to what are essentially Bitcoin banks? Pass. Risk my ability to be able to afford rent if I get paid $2000 one week and it's worth $10 by the time I have to pay rent? Pass. 

Again, you are living in Bitcoin dream land. I'm living in reality. In bitcoin dream land, miner fees are the biggest problem. In bitcoin reality, miner fees are an afterthought.

I'm a seller and buyer on localbitcoins. I know there are many ways to acquire bitcoin. I know none of them are cheap or hastle free. I know that anyone who went through the trouble and costs of using one of those methods to acquire bitcoin they are gonna spend on t shirts and coffee is an utter fool. If you know any idiots who wants to pay my 8% fee (market rate in my area of the united states) to buy bitcoin off me in cash so they can use it to purchase legal goods, please send them my way will you? You can probably guess that 99% of buyers who pay that fee aren't using it to buy coffee and t shirts. "
"Oh I have no banner of charity at all. That's the beauty of Bitcoin and crypto, it's driven by raw human capitalist greed. There is no morality or subjectivity. I'm 100% in it for the sole benefit of me and my family.

Playing the game with fiat is like sitting down at a table of friends who have been playing Monopoly the board game for an hour and they ask if you wanna join and you say sure! Then of course you have a miserable experience because the system is rigged against you.

Bitcoin is a another instance of a game of monopoly, and I'm sorry if you didn't get to the table quick enough. There will be many other games of monopoly to come. 

Your post history today indicates you are simply rather salty about not getting in soon enough, and now you want to convince yourself that you don't wanna get involved now. Sounds like you are genuinely surprised that your $100 of investment money won't get you anywhere. Been there bruh. Go to school for a technical degree, get a good job in a high demand field with a future, earn money, then look at investments. It's an utter waste of time for you to cry to all of us about how your $100 won't make you rich. Welcome to capitalism bruh. "
"Calvin Ayre's sites are doing Bitcoin Cash as well (although you have to call in to use it for some reason.) He is in cahoots with CSW and Ver though of course.

Haven't heard of any ETH gambling developments. 

Regardless, I was more just trying to show this butter a use case for crypto. Leave it to you guys to use it to pump some altcoins."
Well then it sounds like you have quite a lucrative investment opportunity in front of you based on these beliefs of yours! Best of luck!
"There is tons of infrastructure for non-Bitcoin crypto now. Most payment gateways offer multiple coins.

You really have *no idea* how you would acquire crypto without a bank account? You just mentioned one yourself — you could get paid in crypto. Is your short-term memory really so bad that you cannot remember what you wrote two posts ago? And there are other ways as well. For privacy reasons, I didn't acquire *any* of my crypto through a bank account. Let's see if you can figure out what are the other ways Mr. 'I am fully invested in and know all about crypto.' I can't wait for you to fail to list any: I will be laughing my ass off."
Oh, betting, gambling and paying for filesharing accounts. That's really great and a revolution on its own. It's my right to gamble and for the institutions granting me money risk assessment is just another way to cut this rights. Question: If you're bank used a cryptographically secured asset which could handle tx way faster that BTC with almost no fees (or no fees at all). You would still use high few low Speed BTC, because you make your own laws and you're free to do whatever you want? So THEN tx time wouldn't matter anymore, right? Same goes to tax evasion, since YOU decide what taxes are right and wrong. And it's not your problem if the only proper use case is evading government rules. Because the GOOD causes far outway the bad ones, also right? So fuck institutions, let the market and the well educated people decide how they handle their money. Sorry, for being sarcastic. But These arguments are so overblown right now. You're in to get rich without doing anything. No need for wearing the banner of charity. 
Aren't all the top online betting sites moving to bitcoin cash or ethereum, because fees are much cheaper?
"> Bitcoin is the preferred currency of about 80% of the users there because it simply makes sense.

Online gambling will migrate to one of the many cryptos tailored specifically to their needs (fast confirmation, built-in RNGs) like funfair, for example.

Bitcoin is being eaten alive by its competition, the market just hasn't woken up to that fact yet.
"
"Time saved? Yes. It's a very efficient way to make payments.

No advantages offered? I'm opting out of fiat, which is a great contribution we can all make, and I love doing that. This is the best part.

Money saved? I'm not donating 2% of my transaction to Visa or Mastercard. Merchant gets the extra money or gives the buyer 1-2% off.

You must be new here."
"Nope.

>The reality being that Bitcoin is still far too much in the early days to be useful for small legal purchases, regardless of miner fees. The volatility is too high, the infrastructure isn't there, and the onramp fees are far too high.

That applies to any crypto currently. None of them can bank the unbanked for jack shit. Good luck even acquiring some if you don't have a bank lol. Are you living in a dream world or something?"
"Practically every coin *but* Bitcoin can bank the unbanked. Right now. Today. What you're calling the general situation is only the situation for *one coin only* so it's very clear that you are a partisan for that coin and wish to level the playing field at a time when your favourite coin is at an extreme disadvantage due to a horribly incompetent development history.

As for your attitude that nobody uses cheque cashing services, that is just typical elitist drivel. All the unbanked in the world basically just don't exist for you — they are unimportant in your world view. That is an exactly opposite world view to the one that drove the invention of Bitcoin in the first place.

I love debating clueless economic elitists such as yourself, because every word out of your keyboard is another nail in Bitcoin Core's coffin."
"No, that's not what I was asking you for. I'm tired of ""seeing the big picture"". In reality it's the details that matter most. And that's why I'm asking. I don't get this whole store of value shit either. Just call it speculative vehicle with a headstart for early adopters, for Christ's sake. This sharade is getting lame. "
Most of us have made expensive mistakes investing in crypto. Most of us don't boast about our large retirement fund when called out on it however. Yours wasn't too bad in comparison, you could bought back at less than twice the value.
"> 1% is not 'very expensive'. Compared to cheque cashing services, it's a steal.

Right, because that's how most people spend their paychecks. Lulz.

>Bitcoin was supposed to ""bank the unbanked"".

Oh it will be, in time. I understand that Core has been painted as your scapegoat for ""WHY IS IT NOT THAT WAY RIGHT NOW THOUGH?!?!?!"", and I'm sure it's nice to be able to point your finger at one group of people and claim they have blocked that dream.

The reality isn't as easy to accept because there is no one entity to get mad at and you have to be patient. The reality being that Bitcoin is still far too much in the early days to be useful for small legal purchases, regardless of miner fees. The volatility is too high, the infrastructure isn't there, and the onramp fees are far too high.

But hey, don't let me shatter your bubble. We have the bitcoin cash experiment now, so surely we will see the whole world using bitcoin cash for all of their everyday purchases in no time now that core is out of the way. I mean... yeah.. we had tons of other altcoins with no on chain fees for 5+ years now that didn't gain any traction in that regard, but this one is different because it has Bitcoin in the name. 

"
"Yeah you can speculate with it or use it as a deflationary store of value. 

If it doesn't make any sense for you to use for something, then simply don't. 

You either see the bigger picture or you don't. You either see the flaws of fiat money or you don't. Don't expect someone else to determine what you see value in and what you see use for. If you don't get it, move on and enjoy other fruits of life.

"
I told friends it was overvalued at $2700. Said wait til it dips back under 1k to enter.  Boy do I look like an ass. 
Funny that you say Bitcoin is not YET useful for these things. I could have sworn it was, three years ago.
"1% is not 'very expensive'. Compared to cheque cashing services, it's a steal. Bitcoin was supposed to ""bank the unbanked"". That turned out to be bullshit due to braindead development plan. Bitcoin Cash actually can bank the unbanked."
"Are you talking of BTC or possibly other cryptocurrencies? And what is this ""anything""? You mean making a lot of Money without working but speculating and Holding it? Don't  get me wrong, I'm just interested because I still don't get the vision underlying this hopes and dreams. And I'm interested in open and rational discourse. Maybe call it: ""Bitcoin. Beyond dreams and hopes."" ;-)"
Thanks, couldn't have said it better.
Still thats like 4-5 times more than a swift transfer
"So why do you keep following the ""charade""? Move on with life. Find something that appeals to your needs. It sounds like Bitcoin doesn't offer you anything personally, and that's ok.

If you want a great specific use case, head to /r/sportsbook. Bitcoin is the preferred currency of about 80% of the users there because it simply makes sense. Head to Bovada.lv or topbet.eu and compare the costs and speeds of withdrawing/depositing fiat versus bitcoin. Ask yourself how many users want their banks to know their gambling habits?"
How about when fees are $50?
Sounds tulippy.
Facepalm moment ahead when you can get cheaper airfare than doing transferring it online.

Wait that's not Dwight ?

More like in 2011 to keep a _significant portion enough_ of it despite bloody Empty Gox.
is that the same Falkvinge who put his net worth in Bitcoin in 2012 only to lose all of it by the next year? 
"I find the fact that only rbtc regulars have insanely expensive fees, and only for them it takes more than an instant to set a sell order.

They cry and moan about how they are dumping, or are about to, but when tx are resolved, they are still ""just about™"" to hit the sell button..."
"> I have no clue who is using Bitcoin to buy anything under $100.

Legal goods under $100? Yeah nobody with half a brain is using bitcoin to do that. Absolutely no advantages offered, time saved, or money saved by doing that EVEN IF MINER FEES WERE $0. It's fucking retarded. 

"
"> put his net worth in Bitcoin in 2012 only to lose all of it by the next year?

anyone who put his net worth in Bitcoin in 2012 would have been up at any point in 2013, maybe by 20X or more depending on the date."
This is a man of his word, if only Roger Ver where that much of a man to!
Pah, this game is not for the poor anymore. 100 $ worth in BTC won't get you rich anyway. It's big investor's game now and early Investors with small purses just cheering from the sidelines.
So, you say, BTC has still a strong usecase in human trafficking, narcotics and money laundering? 
"> The only use-case for bitcoin is sending money to other countries.

The only use-case for bitcoin is speculation. This is a setup for a huge crash, because the fundamental value-proposition of Bitocoin is being pulled out from under it.
"
I think most of the bitcoin transactions at this point are not actually for goods or services. Just people selling it for Fiat/alts and people buying it to later sell it for more Fiat/alts.
