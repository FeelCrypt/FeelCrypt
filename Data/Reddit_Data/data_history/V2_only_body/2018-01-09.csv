"Extremely late reply, but I took you up on that offer to see what /rbitcoin has to say. I am posting this reply here in case anyone stumbles upon it. If anyone finds this then do our own research and I'm sure you will come to a reasonable conclusion. Below is a dm I sent to this user - a recollection of the things I've learned since a month ago:

>You probably don't remember, but we had a little conversation here:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq7vyqe/

>I'm not sure the exact place our conversation ended but it sparked in me a journey to learn more about the underworkings of Bitcoin. As a result, I have come to the conclusion that both BitcoinCore and BitcoinCash have a place here. I no longer feel that Core is intentionally hurting Bitcoin but rather that their dreams are harder to realize than previously thought. Seeing how we have so many centralized/premined currencies actually doing well I see the danger of a future with establishment taking control of Crypto. As a result I see the usefulness and requirement of Core's need to stay decentralized AND scale well. I know we have offchain ideas which may be monetized but i leaves the ability to stay decentralized and possible scaling improvements down the road.

>I also think that Cash is being led by people who truly believed in a p2p, fast, (insert all other adjectives of crypto), currency for the masses. Core just didn't work out and had to split.

>Maybe I'm just looking at the best possible scenario without human greed and stuff but it makes sense to me.

>I am still learning more about Bitcoin but seeing as how we have other incredible ideas among us in the form of potential altcoins I am not sure if I will ever feel like I have done enough research. I only started looking up Iota last night, and the idea behind Tangle (as opposed to Blockchain) is mind blowing.

>Anyways, it's getting long now. Just wanted to thank you for not dismissing me back then and having a legit conversation despite differences in belief.

>If you give me a BitcoinCash address then Ill be glad to buy you a drink. (no, this isn't a jab at mempool/fees)."

How do I know anyone is actually monitoring my channel though?
"Lightning White paper, 2015:

> The bitcoin protocol can **encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today**, without a singlecustodial third party holding funds or requiring participants to haveanything more than a computer using a broadband connection.

Lightning Network apologist, 2018:

> Even 3 transactions per channel is a win

We held up scaling and fucked up the community based on the first quoted promise. And now you're ok with peanuts.

And no, one additional transaction moved offchain is absolutely not worth any of this.  Fuck."
"Trades made on exchanges do not get confirmed on the blockchain.

Literally every single one of the 358,520 transactions in the last 24 hours were transfers from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet. That's literally exactly what that number is measuring, and nothing else.

Anything which is being used is by definition not useless, even if used only once. Is bitcoin accepted by at least one merchant? Is the bitcoin blockchain currently being used?"
"You completely misunderstood me.

What I'm saying is that because channels need an opening and a closing transaction, it makes no sense to open a channel to make a single transaction or two, as that would be more expensive and add bloat to the chain. 

But if you use the channel for 3 or more transactions you'll be saving fees and freeing some on-chain capacity.

In no way did I imply that channels should only be used for 3 transactions each.

By the way, I think the quote you took from the whitepaper is wildly optimistic and the reality won't be even close. 

But that doesn't mean LN won't be useful, it will and I'm very excited for it, it's just not the best option for all use-cases, it has it's own set of disadvantages which will make it better for some use cases but not others. "

Here's the line that started this whole line of discussion:

""letting bitcoin become unusable"" is not the same thing as bitcoin already being completely unusable, although you could just ignore that's what I said and focus on the times I called it unusable as a shorthand because its quicker than writing out ""becoming unusable"" every time. After all what I actually mean is less important to the discussion than what you say I mean.

You can also continue to pretend that usability is binary and that either bitcoin is useful or useless and you can't describe a 40% reduction in the number of top 500 US retailers accepting bitcoin related payments as bitcoin becoming less useful.

I'm not sure what you'll get out of that but you're clearly getting something out of it so do continue.

>You understand that your own source disproves your assertion that it is “useless” as a payment method with merchants, right?

0 of those places actually accept bitcoin.

They accept a service like Bitpay that transfers fiat, not bitcoin.

Course you won't even accept that a 40% reduction in top 500 merchant acceptance is getting less useful so I don't expect you to be able to make the distinction between paying in fiat after selling bitcoin to a 3rd party and bitcoin."

What attack is that? The network was free to choose Bitcoin Unlimited months ago, it didn't. The network wasn't attacked by segwit, it chose it over the alternatives.

>The fact that the solution had to be forced instead of pulled

How was it forced, exactly? Can you give an example of a single person who was forced to run the Core client instead of another?

">Is bitcoin accepted by at least one merchant?

It's being used by less merchants now than it was 4 years ago, which is why I said its becoming useless. Is usefulness a binary state? Or is it possible for something to be more or less without it being absolutely one thing or another?

>Anything which is being used is by definition not useless, even if used only once.

I already acknowledged bitcoin is useful for speculation, I don't know why you keep pretending that I'm not specifically talking about use of currency, and like there's no difference between the two concepts. There's just ""usefulness"" and its impossible to be any more specific than that.

>Trades made on exchanges do not get confirmed on the blockchain.

How do you think people buy/sell bitcoins and get them transferred to a wallet/address?

Every exchange just has every possible amount of bitcoin sitting in a wallet and hands you the keys to them? How did the right amount of bitcoin get into the wallet in the first place without a blockchain transaction?

It's all off chain? What would even be the point of using the blockchain is you can securely transfer millions in bitcoin without transferring on blockchain? That just means you're paying higher fees. High fees and times have decreased the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, but not the number of people using them to buy goods and services? That's why daily transactions are still going up?

$20 fee and 12 hour wait would be crippling for actual purchases of goods and services. It's only viable if you're buying/selling thousands of dollars of bitcoin in which case its only a small percentage and you don't mind if it takes a couple days to confirm.


>Literally every single one of the 358,520 transactions in the last 24 hours were transfers from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet

Definitely not people just buying and selling on fiat though. Even though 99% of anyone talking about bitcoin is just talking about how much they're going to buy and sell for fiat, all these transactions are somehow for goods and services its just not measurable in any way."

">Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. 

It's useless as a currency. Try going into a store with a gold coin or certificate and buy something with it. It doesn't matter how much you talk about ""but its a great store of value! why would you want dollars that just go down in value?"", no one wants to spend gold coins which means no one is interested in accepting them. The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry and electronics industry. The idea its valuable just because its a ""store of value"" is a myth. Platinum is far rarer than gold, but its less valuable because far less people want platinum jewelry than gold jewelry so the fact its rarer doesn't mean shit. 

The fact that billions of dollars of gold are traded every day does not make it a useful currency. How much gold is traded is completely separate from how useful it is as a currency.

>Can you show us these metrics?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/bitcoin-acceptance-among-retailers-is-low-and-getting-lower

In 2014, 5 out of the top 500 US retailers accepted a form of bitcoin payment (none actually accepted bitcoin, they accepted things like BitPay which transfer fiat, not bitcoin, but lets ignore that for now), today its 3 out of the top 500 retailers.

You can google black markets yourself and see how few are still using bitcoin and how many have switched to other cryptocurrencies.

>Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all.

How do you think increased transactions are a result of more people using bitcoin to buy goods and services if the number of merchants accepting bitcoin for goods and services is decreasing? Do you think more and more people are just shopping at fewer and fewer stores? If there's such demand for buying things with bitcoin why is the number of merchants accepting it decreasing instead of increasing? Do they just hate making money?

>You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it

I'd say they're useless as a currency, because no one wants to accept a cheeseburger as currency. If you want to talk about how useful it is as food, that's a separate discussion.

>A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

You can settle debts in things other than currency. If you have no money, debt collectors will accept goods and assets instead.

You've already identified what currency use looks like (buying an apple with a dogecoin), I don't know why you keep trying to define it as something that is not specific to currency. You can burn money, does that mean anything you can burn is also money?

Yeah, I know the history, but what parts are you claiming to be an attack?

I sort of agree that the censorship by Theymos on r/bitcoin can be considered an attack. But even if it's done with malice (I don't think it is, I think he's just very biased with his moderation and considers lots of stuff to be trolling) it's quite a minor attack, there are plenty of alternative places to discuss not controlled by him (such as r/btc). 

But Blockstream hiring people to work on a FOSS project isn't an attack. I mean, what would the attack even be if anyone can fork the code? If people don't use alternative clients (and we're talking about the Core client, which isn't used by non-technical users) that's their decision
And you can't force people to work on what you want. If Bitcoin can't survive that, it has no hope.

Both false.

LN introduces significant counterparty risk not present in onchain Bitcoin.  I've explained this elsewhere in this thread.  It also will significantly reduce fees from the base layer.

Because a Lightning hub is a bank (liquidity provider / transaction router).  It is the target customer.
So if eth in the future has transaction fees that low, what'll be the draw of bch?
it's just a more versatile system that can be used for a lot of things other than just a straight money ledger
Oh for sure, BTH is great. I'm a holder in it for 2020 at least. Yeah i get that ETH vs BTH is halving the size of the networks but don't they ultimately act as a super network when it's that easy to shapeshift ?
I'm saying that as a long-term investment or store of value, it is perfectly viable. 
"Well yeah its great that we have competition and freedom.  But some of these ledgers were not meant to be money.  For example ETH's goal was never really to be money, but instead I think they are trying to achieve a ""world computer"", and ETH is just kind of like the fuel.  They have not even decided the inflation schedule on ETH from my understanding.  A few central entities might hold a lot of influence on how to create more ETH, and it could slip into oligarchy, similar to our legacy banking system.  With Bitcoin its a lot harder, since the ledger and code caps the coins at 21 million.  Even if there were inflationary forks down the line, it would be decided by the free market in a decentralized way without central planners, which is a lot more healthy.

Some economists have criticized crypto as being not a sound money, since anyone can create their own out of thin air, then we have thousands of currencies.  But having the power of one super ledger, and one widely used global money has huge advantages, and I think the market will coalesce mostly on one major currency which will account for like 90% of all market cap.  Then there will always be smaller currencies competing and kind of keeping a check on the larger ones."
I feel like the question wasn't answered. I guess how? I see Bitcoin cash doing the same thing Eth could in that regard. 
What incentive does eth have over bch atm? Better accessibility? Higher profit?

"You're right. The very first cars were restricted to *4mph*, and drivers had to *pay someone else* - to walk in front of them as they crawled slowly forward. That's *Bitcoin*. (RED FLAG!)

But luckily cars, like cryptocurrencies, evolved, and we now have mass-produced cars coming off *many production lines*, They *don't need a third-party* to walk slowly in front of them. So they can travel *from A to B in an instant*.  That's *RaiBlocks XRB*."

I don't see what's wrong with the quote. We are talking about a globally useful currency here, it doesn't need to apply to everything that has ever been radical or revolutionary to be valid. Maybe the quote should specify Bitcoin. In the context of Bitcoin, it is accurate.

"This one really hit home for me.  I believe in the blockchain, and with it, BTC.  I believe in Andreas.  I believe that bitcoin is finally a *real* chance of breaking the financial chains we all carry.

I cannot argue with the statement that tx fees make it inaccessible to the people who need it most.  The idealism I attach to the crypto movement is intertwined with accessibility for everyone.  Is it not true tho, that if we, at this exact moment, switched the entire volume of BTC transactions to the BCH network, that the fees would be similar?"
Do you suppose having a sub named btc that exclusively shit talks bit coin might be stupid and confusing? I do. Do you imagine that poor people wouldn't like to receive bitcoin? I think they would. But heck I'm just a rational guy living in reality.

Bullshit. All emerging revolutionary technologies were initially inaccessible to the poor.

FTFY. It doesn't need to apply to everything that was ever radical or revolutionary. Just Bitcoin. A globally useful peer-to-peer currency."

"huh?? no bch couldn't... that isn't something btc or bch is set up to do right now at all. 

[Here's an easy-to-read article from last year that goes into some of the differences between eth and btc.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ameer-rosic-/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-whats_b_13735404.html)

> ""The first thing about Ethereum is that it is not just a digital currency. It is a blockchain-based platform with many aspects. It features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and it uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts.""

I'm confused mostly because I have no idea how much you know about the subject, and figured if you knew about eth you already knew about smart contracts? 

>Ethereum allows you to create digital tokens that can be used to represent virtual shares, assets, proof of membership and more. These smart contracts are compatible with any wallet, as well as exchanges that use a standard coin API. You can copy the code from Ethereum’s website and then use your tokens for many purposes, including the representation of shares, forms of voting and also fundraising. You can either have a fixed amount of tokens in circulation or have a fluctuating amount based on predetermined rules.

This is all stuff that is easily googled, so it seems silly to argue with someone before doing even one search for yourself. "
You have made quite back few leaps there. Hope you held on to your hat. 
um there's a different balance of forces if your local currency is hyperinflating.. they also try to hold us dollars, but cryptocurrency is one seriously viable option real people are taking to maintain their purchasing power
But for it to be used as a universal currency, to say, go into a store and buy a cup of coffee, Bitcoin cash is the same but better. No point of spending hours for a transaction to go through.
Naw, Bitcoin had it close, it fixed a huge problem with it. Get a 0.02$ transaction fee instead of 20$.
"Bitcoin Legacy is not a store of value because it lacks utility.  You could argue it has a very tiny amount of utility with the giant fees and slow confirms.  The network effect and Metaclfe's Law and the fact that a lot of people were using Bitcoin Legacy helps give it added utility. The more people on a network to connect to, the more valuable it is. But As I linked Falkvinge's post, this is short lived with $30 fees.

You switched to ETH, which seems not a bad idea compared to segwitcoins.  But I would challenge you to consider Metcalfe's Law and the power of one ledger and the network effect.  Bitcoin and Money itself at the most fundamental level is a ledger [as this video explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3HSaUxD1rU).  Its also why [I was able to even predict BCH before is existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).

So sure Bitcoin Legacy will always have some tiny amount of utility.  Kind of like the restaurant is always crowded so nobody goes there anymore.  But if the network effect on the ledger is to continue and go world wide, we will need a fork of the ledger, and that fork is Bitcoin Cash.  BCH is becoming solidified as the only Bitcoin Ledger option more and more everyday.  Even if Core tried raising blocksize now I don't think it can stop the BCH momentum."

"Each ""Send"" transaction requires the sending account to pre-generate a small Proof of Work, which takes a few seconds.  "
How so. 
Of course not...? 
It's a fairly good one. 
I think most advice I read at the moment even from the most bullish protagonists is dont invest in cryptocoins any money that you cant afford to lose. 
"Well played op.

"sigh, if it's both fast and free what stops people from spamming it

Seen any tiny BTC payments?
"Well thanks for arguing the point at least. I agree you can't have a store of wealth without utility but that's circular reasoning, bitcoin can't be a store of wealth because it has no utility and it has no utility because it's not a currency and not a store of wealth. You didn't actually prove the point that bitcoin has no utility that is still in contention. 

Mises regression theorem is just a way to prove why people exchange their goods and services for money instead of buying things directly with theirs goods and services. Why is there a middle man ? The theorem concerns itself with MARGINAL utility, the extra utility we get from money compared to the stuff we exchange for it (work for most people). 

It's more useful to me to work for money than try to trade my work for each thing I need, food, shelter, etc. That's all it says. I don't know where in there you found a justification for Bitcoin not having utility. If the people currently holding Bitcoin didn't consider it useful to them they would sell it, thus the argument is void. 

As for the argument that BTC isn't for poor people therefore it's shooting itself in the foot: totally 100% agree. 30$ fees are non sustainable. I personally divested from bitcoin and moved into Ethereum for this reason and several others (turing completeness, many ICO's paying into the mining, etc). 

But to say that because bitcoin has wild swings it's not a store of value is just wrong. If people use it as a store of value, this guy looking down on them because of the swings is too big for him to stomach doesn't mean it's not a store of value. In fact, he compares to a Picasso, which is definitely a store of value for every rich person on this planet. "
Well if you take the market cap of gold its not that big compared to the total market cap of the M1 Monetary Base.  Bitcoin Legacy is trying for the former, while BCH is trying for the latter.  Lot more upside potential for BCH.
No, it’s still wrong.
sure but there charges to buy and sell are very high for me at least....I noticed some price aggregators have removed some korean exchanges b/c prices are so out of whack.
No you're not.

What do you mean! Yes I have now been to the website to see how it works. But when you get a scam device which has instruction on it already and you do not know it is a scam device you follow those instruction. The instructions only told me to go to the Ledger app site after the Ledger has been set up as per the instructions with the Ledger.
"Yup. Had he bought two ledgers from two different sources, he would have either seen the scam or only lost half his money. 

My only point is this: if you have a lot of money in crypto, spend some time and money on security."
"I bought one from the same guy on ebay, I haven't lost anything though, thank who ever is looking out for me. My scratch card had the same words but I have different seed words to what was on there. I think I reset the device to generate seed words when setting up but can't remember as this wasn't particularly my intention. Is the fact I have different seed words mean I am safe? Just to check did that save me from losing money? I took everything off the wallets now but if possible I would like to put bitcoin back on this so I can get the Bitcoin Rhodium airdrop on 10th Jan - the address I used was on this device. I did buy another directly from you because I was worried and wanted a spare but the registration for BTR is now closed. The bitcoin is now on binance but I don't think they're part of the BTR airdrop.

I just want to know if the nano s I bought from ebay is safe or might the guy have a record of the seed words that I have and the scratch card words mean nothing and wouldn't even work even if I tried to use them (before generating my own if that is what I did). Thank you.
"
To confirm that you actually have your key written correctly and can recover, if need be.  Better to lose a tiny amount and know you screwed something up than to lose your entire portfolio.
What's the reason for intentionally wiping?
Isn’t the guy with the scratch paper SEED?
Security is something that can never be compromised. Even if it takes 6 months, its no excuse to buy from a 3rd party. You seek out other options to secure $34,000. 
Dude.. i do not want to invest in cryptos... but i want to have some ledger products!  nice job guys
">My only point is this: if you have a lot of money in crypto, spend some time and money on security

I agree but how much to guarantee security?"
Ledger is secure or not, it doesn’t depend on the amount.
"Read all of the posts about  ‘so I put $50k on my ledger and it’s gone’ and you are technically right while objectively wrong.

If the guy that got scammed this week had bought two from two different sellers he would have lost less. Now you will most definitely argue that’s ‘not ledgers fault’ which is both true and unhelpful."
Pick a percentage of your profits to spend on security.
"I bought one from the same guy on ebay, I haven't lost anything though, thank who ever is looking out for me. My scratch card had the same words but I have different seed words to what was on there. I think I reset the device to generate seed words when setting up but can't remember as this wasn't particularly my intention. Is the fact I have different seed words mean I am safe?

"There’s never a 100% guarantee. But if you split your holdings into $10,000 batches and have one paper wallet (or hardware wallet) per batch you are spending 1% on security. 

That sounds like a pretty good starting point.

I know people that have millions in a single wallet, so I may be in the minority here."
After all of this, you still haven't went to ledger's website to learn how this device works?
"If it came with a scratch card, then it's a scam.

However, the Ledger device itself is probably ok, but it needs to be reset.

The Ledger CEO says that if you enter the wrong PIN code 3 times, then it will wipe the Ledger clean, and you can generate new seed words.

https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7i12x5/latest_ledger_nano_s/dqvdht7/  

I'm not fully familiar with the Ledger, but if you had initially imported your own addresses & private keys to the compromised Ledger, then later wiped/reset the device, it's possible that the scammer captured your addresses & private keys before you did your reset, so you'd have to generate new addresses & private keys."
What an excellent response. Great stuff, I’ll buy a ledger as my next hardware product (although a timeframe on when ledger blue’s will be available again would be great).
I think it would have fooled me too tbh
It's one of the main reasons they are all switching. They suffer volatility either way as dealers but the fees are crippling.  And buyers are hesitant to spend a huge chunk of change to buy $50 worth of weed.
How do we know it is actually random & not pre prepared by the Ledger company and they're just waiting in line for a massive false flag event to blame on emptying everyone's wallet as they already know the seed phrases / private keys?

Not at all. Censorship on r/bitcoin is a coin of two sides: we successfully survived social engineering attack, thus, it'll make second attempt much more expensive up to impossible. Exposure!"

150,526 now.. I forgot to subscribe before
I love this community. Congrats everyone!
Wow, that was fast! Great job, folks. Keep it positive and censor free! 
Relatively new around these parts, but loving the censor-free discussions so far! Great work people ✌🏼
"How many of those subscribers came in knowing that this place loves BCH and hates BTC.  

It's like being proud of a Burger King having a lot of customers, even though the sign says McDonalds. "
I’ve been slowly selling my BCH for other coins that are 10x this past week. Somethings going to have to happen soon so I don’t sell the rest. 
its not difficult to achieve milestone 300K subscribers. Work together. 
congrats! bitcoincash is also growing along with /r/btc
and the price will be 150k soon, just hodl boys
"Another great milestone achieved.
 Great work everyone :)"
500k by 2019!
Cheers!!!! Onwards we go
Pumped to be part of the real Bitcoin!
awesome, keep it up!
Woo hoo! Here's to the next milestone! 
Time really flies. 500k this year my friends.
"A huge milestone. Awesome stuff.

I want to give a shoutout to the mod team. I might not contribute to this sub that often, but I have never had nor heard of a single moderation issue on this Subreddit. Thank you mods, for keeping the community awesome."
This sub actually taught me something about crypto. Happy to see that we can teach thousands of other about the wonder of crypto! 
"Well hopefully Bitcoin cash gets the recognition it deserves

"
"who was here for the 10k party?

This guy."
Thank you to all the mods for making this a place where we can freely discuss BCH, BTC, crypto in general and so on without worry of that free speech being stomped on!
Congrats! I subscribe to both the subs. I am not much into investment anymore. But I will contribute in terms of knowledge and support!
Heres to the next 150,000 🍻
Im new here and only been here a couple of days but the community has already been really kind amd helpful for me :)
That was quick.
We need a big marketing push this month, anyone willing to contribute towards advertising on reddit?
"Came here at 100,000 and I don’t even hold much bcc.
But I’m really startled by the positive vibes of this community.
To the 200k club we go..."
you're welcome
Dilly Dilly!
Grats my dudes! I’ve never bought any myself but I’m mining minuscule amounts with my 1070 while I sleep 😢 
GO BTC!
I became active in this community last year in December. It's been a great ride so far. And yep, it's been getting bigger :3
"And 15 hours later there are 900 more... Exactly 1 new suscrption per minute. Breathtaking!

I wonder when we'll reach the critical mass..."
What a great mile stone - happy to be a part of it!
[deleted]
Came for the info stayed for the enjoyment cheers /r/btc 🎉🎉
Congrats guys, you've done great! Keep it up mods :)
"Absolutely fantastic, this is such a great community and I'm proud to be a part of it, as a moderator of a small bitcoin sub (/r/BitcoinAus), I try to follow the examples set here for free and objective discussion.

Keep it up mods!"
Happened almost exactly when I received my r/bitcoin ban lol
Thanks for being *proper* moderators. Keeping the sub clean, but ultimately not interjecting your beliefs into that
Here’s to another 150k!
A big thank you to all of you who take the time to answer questions for new users. Everybody has to start somewhere, and lots of other subs want to put people down instead of encouraging others. This is a great community. 
Yes! I just subscribed! One less to the 200,000!
[deleted]
Huge milestone. A few of those new subscribers are my IRL friends. Started by having them make wallets and giving them BCH. Now I can tip my favorite bartender with BCH. Great community.
"I hope I'm not late to the party!

This looks like a great subreddit
"
IMO, this is better than any price milestone! Love this community and it's interaction :)
When you don't ban people for asking questions, your community grows. Who knew?
Wooaahhh. I linked 2 friends here. Im happy to be part of this community all the way from Philippines!!
"It is it more fun to tip on reddit to people who probably don’t need change, than to tip homeless people on the street who do need it.

Edit: Confirmed I have given more out on reddit in the last few weeks than I have to beggars On the street.  Shame on me.  "
This is one of the cryptocurrency subreddits I actually like.
We’ve come a long way. Keep it up!
Wow a tipping galore. Lol This is why I love this community better, uncensored and people are very nice.
And soon to overtake r/bitcoin. The people have spoken!
Great work. Soon BCH avarage transaction amount also 150k per day.
"Congrats everyone! This truly is awesome!

r/btc subs / r/bitcoin subs = .2317

BCH Price / BTC Price = 0.158962"
What's going on?
"I still recall when this sub had less than 10,000 subscribers. I was actually sent her from r/bitcoin when a user mentioned and linked to 'the other sub'.

Here's to another 150,000!"
[deleted]
Victory is coming. 
This is really great news. Here's to uncensored discussion and a bright year for bitcoin cash.
O yeahhh 
hmm... :)
[deleted]
Let's go for 200 000! We can do it! 
"Congratz /r/BTC!!! 
Anyone want to bet on when the FLIPPENING will occur??"
Wow! When I joined r/btc in november it was like 70-80 K. This growth has been fast like just like market growth of bch
Well hopefully Bitcoin cash gets the recognition it deserves
Only joined recently and it's been awesome!

"Exactly, I don't get those people who keep asking and suggesting raising the blocksize on BTC. It has been made perfectly clear that this is not something BTC wants to do. **If you have a different opinion then BTC is not a coin for you, it's that simple!**

It's like people buying XRP and then demanding they get rid of all the banks using it - this is the entire premise of the coin, don't be stupid!

And small blocks + SW + LN is an entire premise of BTC (as it has become), if you believe in that vision hold it, if you do not, sell it! Simple.

If you favor bigger blocks, use BCH instead of BTC, the visions have clearly separated - make up your mind and hold the one you believe in."

"I'm not ""telling him to have certain opinion.""  That's an unfair mischaracterization.

The problem is that every goddamn day my friend (who I really want to like) is just going on and on about this fucking problem he has with Pepsi not tasting more like Coke, and frankly, I get tired of him ranting endlessly about this ""problem"" of his, when he *could* just STFU and drink Cokes instead.  Apparently it's some huge hang up for him to be associated with the ""coke"" brand because he's just fixated on this ""Pepsi"" mantra.
 
So I'm not telling him what opinion to have, I'm explaining why his complaining isn't likely to get him anywhere since Pepsi drinkers actually LOVE Pepsi, and I'm suggesting that he quit complaining all the time and just drink a cola that tastes like what he keeps saying he wants.  At some point if he keeps this up we're likely to stop being friends...."

I think the block size is actually quite a large part of the puzzle. Particularly for users who might not know the ins and outs of the development team.

"> how can a fork ever achieve a majority of the community if people like yourself will not support it until it has one

Actually, a fork can achieve a majority since many people know better. Note that the only stance compatible with such an opinion would be to support fiat now."
It can't. Community consensus has to be gauged before the fork happens (e.g. through miner signalling or large economic nodes expressing support). Unfortunately, Bitcoin Cash failed to secure majority support from the community and it is therefore dead to me.
"Should primary developers be prohibited from working for money? Do they have to work for donations, have unrelated side jobs or be independently wealthy for them to be acceptable to you?

Side chains certainly won't ""die immediately"" with a hard fork. The tippr bot works just fine (better even) on BCH's hard forked blockchain!

Hard forks are easy for new coins. They are virtually guaranteed to be progressively harder as economic actors increasingly using the blockchain have competing interests.

Blockstream still has a hard fork on their roadmap, but two important things happened around three years ago. First, the rate of orphaned blocks increased significantly around 250MB per block, causing miners to collapse toward the largest, most profitable pool, i think even driving them briefly over 51% hash rate until they self capped well below that level.

Thin blocks reduced this problem, but they have only increased the size at which it has an economic impact -- at some point, transaction propagation (not block propagation) will be a bottleneck even if blocks are compressed to nothing.

Second, core developers working on segwit to eliminate transaction malleability realized they could do it in a way that would increase block capacity by around 2x.

That was the point that they stopped advocating for a separate block size increase. They had designed a soft fork upgrade that they considered less risky than a hard fork that would need to come before many of the items on the hard fork wish list would be ready.

That's not to say it's impossible that core developers paid by blockstream are working against what they see as the best path forward, instead prioritizing blockstream profits. It's just disingenuous to claim that's the only possible explanation for why things have developed the way they have."
Wait, is that the case? I was not aware.
">It isn't that increasing the blocksize via hard fork is bad, it's that the political reasons for the forks listed in this thread were almost all rotten to the core.

What are they?

>That doesn't touch upon the issue that when you *can* increase the blocksize via SF, do that first *and then HF later.*


The problem with SF is not that you can increase the blocksize.. it is that you can censor tx, change the economics characteristics of Bitcoin, roll back the chain.. all that only with 51% miner support.

That make SF very, very potent.

Much more than HF."
Well I hope this sub understands that terabyte sized blocks mean only huge datacenters could run nodes, and then you have a truly centralized coin.

"That's a slogan they use to make themselves immune to criticism. At this point when I hear Core propaganda it's all as cognitive and relevant to me as ""I'm lovin' it"" or ""Got Milk?"" Here's u/el33th4xor commenting on the matter in [this interview](https://cointelegraph.com/news/secret-bitcoin-troll-army-pushes-for-segwit-adoption-emin-gun-sirer):

> CT: Can you define ""Core""? Is it the entire Bitcoin Core development team?

>EGS: No, Bitcoin Core is a piece of software that constitutes the predominant Bitcoin client. It draws on a large base of contributors. The various Core contributors will repeatedly remind us that ""Bitcoin Core"" is not a singular entity -- as such, they will get upset at any effort to taint ""Bitcoin Core"" with Dragon's Den. However, these efforts are a way to shirk off responsibility, by trying to shape the discourse, by trying to make themselves unnameable.

>By ""Core"" here, as distinct from ""Bitcoin Core"", I am referring to those individuals who collectively launch campaigns to serve interests of a selected group of individuals whose economic interests coincide with those embodied in the ""Bitcoin Core"" software. These individuals may include contributors to Bitcoin Core, and they likely include people with zero contributions to Bitcoin Core. Being a Bitcoin Core does not automatically include one in this group.

>Social scientists are perfectly happy to use fuzzy definitions when identifying such tribal formations."
"You are extremely mistaken.

Segwit is the *product* of Bitcoin Core.  It is the thing that they have been *pushing* for 18+ months now."
That is my hope. I think it's essential for blockchain cryptos to have some kind of off-chain immediate confirm. Even Ethereum has its Raiden network planned.
"> Do you think those poor people who don't have enough system requirements to validate the block have enough money to pay the current transaction fees?

No I don't, but as the keepers of BTC have warned us about now for years, **these people should not be using Bitcoin Core**

They have **literally** been telling these people for a year to switch to altcoins."
"The Core devs that we have now no longer want to build what Bitcoin was originally envisioned to be. I don't think there is malice. Instead, they are trying to build some kind of cryptographic rube goldberg machine that they think is the coolest thing anyone has ever designed. They think what Satoshi wanted to build was flawed - Greg Maxwell is often quoted for saying how Bitcoin as Satoshi designed doesn't work.

So Core has set out to show the world that they can build something better. Who knows, maybe they can make something interesting with a 1MB blocksize. But for what they are trying to build, it only matters that there is a constant backlog of transactions and a fee market. Why would they increase the blocksize if it doesn't help what they are trying to build? Their ""customers"" are not the users of Bitcoin - it's themselves (and part of ""themselves"" is Blockstream since they employ most of the Core devs who make consensus critical code changes). There is no reason to listen if you know you are smarter than everyone else."
My point was that eventually bitcoin will increase block size via a hard fork.
By forking away and starting a brand new coin with a different name?
">Both camps seem remarkably drawn to building massive conspiracy theories based largely on the implicit assumption that their opponent is a homogeneous army working under tight (but never evidenced) control of a couple evil leaders.

Well it shouldn’t be hard for anyone with a bit of common sense to see though the bullshit.

Blockstream hired key dev that got a veto on any decision regarding Bitcoin protocol.

Blockstream business plan is sidechain, such business plan die immediately if it possible the hard fork to upgrade the protocol.

Suddenly about three ago in most Bitcoin forums Hard Fork became the worst thing, (even though Satoshi himself said such upgrade had to be done)

Fast forward today, Bitcoin stuck at 1MB and blockstream selling trusted sidechain (liquid, alpha).."
"One might have noticed that I was aware of that given it was precisely what I was referencing when I said ""it is historically demonstrable that this group of people exists"". The fact that segwit2x fell through doesn't mean the people who wanted it disappeared or have no right to argue for the coin parameters they want. Insistence that people have to choose between two things they don't like instead of fighting to get what they do want is a bullshit argument.

The thing that pisses me off the most in this entire argument is how both sides seem to think they have some right to tell people what they should want and how they should go about getting it. Both sides are just appealing to authority in different ways and it is bullshit that completely misses the point of the system."
"I kept both because I still considered the possibility that Core might be convinced by events and turn things around. But every day that passes, the possibility that Core will see the light diminishes and even if they did, the inability to reverse the failure becomes more and more inevitable.

Couple that with the option to cash out in some way becomes more and more expensive and I think 2018 will be my exit year and I won't be alone."

"Worst comes to worst, it puts BTC in an endless competition with BCH looming over it's shoulder, ensuring that if they ever get LN functioning in the next century, it has huge incentive to not be corrupt.

">Although I've yet to understand the disdain for segretated witness. Why did that finally trigger the hard fork? 

Large tx discount, (impact on scalability)

And using a soft fork to do change that should only be allowed via hard fork.

The whole point of competition is that it frees different endeavors to fill different gaps in the market.

[deleted]
Nah Core has always wanted Segwit because they need it as a malleability fix. Once they have a malleability fix they can build the second layer, which is their plan to redirect towards themselves some of the fees that miners are getting. What was kind of shoe-horned into Segwit reluctantly by Core were the block-increase and fee reduction aspects, those things were needed in order for them to get people to use Segwit at all. Though with ~10% adoption opinions differ about the extent to which these features have incentivized people to use Segwit.
I won't, because I feel personally wronged when theymos and Core devs stole from me the meaning of Bitcoin. I am not trying to steal anything, I am trying to get it back.
"> stop trying to leech off the ""Bitcoin"" brand

Why? Who exactly controls this ""brand"" and what authority do they have to claim it?

Bitcoin Cash is the original ""[Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)"" and therefore has every right to continue to use the brand.  My Bitcoin Cash node contains the entire blockchain all the way back to Satoshi's original Genesis block.  It's real Bitcoin.

It is Bitcoin Core with Segwit that is leeching off the Bitcoin brand, because BTC is **not** ""Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash"" but instead a completely different project that aims to become a kind of banking settlement network for a future ""Layer 2"" transactional system.  It's completely different from the form of Bitcoin described in the Satoshi paper.  Many people mistakenly purchase BTC because they have no idea that the whole project has been co-opted and transformed into something radically different than Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash."

Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and many others would not exist had it not been for the (insanely) inept choices made by Core.

"I'd call them failed attempts at a miner consensus for a hard fork.

Eventually Bitcoin Cash abandended those attempts for consensus and forked anyway."
"All of them were, essentially, shot down because ""NIH."""
In a decentralized system, this value should be set by the participants (miners). Not dictated by a central party or written in the code. Every ten minutes a miner should be able to adjust the blocksize. If they want to deliver more blocksize to the market, then go ahead. If they want to deliver Less, then they can do that too. Users can offer money to be included and to incentivize miners to add their transactions. This is the way a free market works. 
What's the absolute smallest blocksize possible (pretty sure it's non-zero =P) and still have a functioning version of Bitcoin?
">If 1MB in fact is better than 20MB, 8MB, 2MB or 1.1MB... Maybe 0.9MB is the way to go. Or perhaps 0.5MB?

Strangely enough even with the larger blocker crowd gone the is no consensus for it... /u/luke_jr"
That's where you are wrong and I'm not sure why you insist on this idea. It is possible to get (super)majority consensus on certain issues (e.g. SegWit activation was done that way, the Ethereum hard fork, etc.). This is how most governments function as well.
BCH will adopt lightning, as long as it doesn't interfere with on-chain TX.  Big blocks + LN = Lots of cheap TX.

As for what Satoshi did in his post; he proposed an approach for making whole-network upgrades (hardforks). I appreciate that he was speaking in the context of a discussion on blocksize, and I think Satoshi would clearly support raising the blocksize long before the current shitty situation developed. But ultimately he didn’t try to raise the blocksize. He could have done so at that time with basically zero opposition if he had wanted to."

"> That's really the correct answer here. If everyone thought like you (""I won't support a fork until it has a majority"") no fork would ever be possible, by definition.

You are lacking in imagination. If everyone thought like me, we would all agree on increasing the blockchain at block X and go through with it. I'm not sure what's so hard to grasp? Majority hard forks have successfully been done in the past and in other crypto currencies as well (e.g. Ethereum).

Not much. It's not like I was interested in open source since 2008 or anything.

We can add examples from the open source world that are similar to what's going on here. The most obvious example is OpenOffice / LibreOffice. LibreOffice was born because OpenOffice had become stagnant and its parent company, Sun, was recently bought by Oracle. So all open source developers migrated to LO, and it's currently the side that came successful (I'm not sure if OpenOffice is in active development anymore).

This is the that's happening with Bitcoin. A project that was doing well, until a company came and tried to manipulate its way into it, and advocates of the original idea forking the project to ditch the company and keep the idea alive."
"> But as far as I’m aware Jeff didn’t really push the issue back then beyond the short thread you linked. I really wish he had, it would have avoided a lot of the insanity of the last few years.

I'm quite sure that the reason that Jeff didn't push the issue is that **Satoshi assured him that the block size patch would be in place long before it was needed:**

For me I realized:

1. The soft fork approach is a coercive and thus unacceptable way to impose contentious change

2. Once it's added it makes future onchain scaling even more politically difficult than it is now (since the max permitted block is ~2X the max expected block)

3. The soft fork approach made Segwit code much harder to work with, fewer people know how to safely code for it, worsening the developer centralization problem

4. There was some limited concern that Segwit degrades the security model (more ""wart"" than ""cancer"" but still)

5. It didn't seem as if it would provide any significant block-size relief, even if it did work as otherwise expected

"Agreed. Since there now is a competing big block Bitcoin, there will be a huge astroturfing campaign to keep BTC at 1MB forever by those that want to see BCH succeed at the expense of BTC. BTC is going to have a *really* hard time ever increasing the blocksize without causing another coin split (and losing the ""BTC/Bitcoin"" moniker). BTC is honestly in a tough position now as every change from this point forward must be a soft fork. The Core dev team created this situation so there is no one to blame but themselves."

"> We should not give up and keep pushing Bitcoin Core to increase the blocksize!

No way man.

What right do you have to sabotage the mission of everyone's BTC coins?  People who hold on that chain do so because they believe in the small-block / 2nd layer mission.   Now we have big-block Bitcoins and you're not satisfied?

Why disrupt that community of like-minded people to make them more like you, throwing wrenches into their plans, when there's a community of people who agree with you right here that you're choosing not to join? 

What about all the people who are undecided and hold on both chains?  Have they no right to see these competing strategies play out to their fruition?"
I have a feeling a block size increase will happen in spite of the propaganda.
"I think /u/jessquit's point is that it is the ecosystem surrounding BTC telling you to shut up about raising the blocksize. Conversations are blocked on /r/bitcoin and developers are ""moderated"" on the Core developer mailing list. They don't even want to talk about it, much less do it. There is no reason to continue discussing it because no one is listening. Anyone who would have listened has moved on."

unless and until you do, you will continue feeling somehow victimized by bitcoin's evolution."
good, we agree then. 
"Being hesitant about hard forking has always been a primary reason for avoiding the direct block size increase. Core developers refuse to rewrite blockchain rules unless all current critical changes can be rolled into a single hard fork, and it's tested until it bleeds.

A significant portion of no2x was opposed solely to a core-free increase, not a block size increase in general.

It's easy to lose nuance when people talk in sound bytes! That's true both of those few no2x-ers who managed to convince themselves that 2x block size increase is evil (and not simply an unnecessarily risky hard fork when the segwit effective increase is still underutilized) and people criticizing no2x-ers for blocking any block size increase forever.

Meanwhile, not only can these two groups not talk to each other because they're both interacting primarily with parodies of their opponents, it's nearly impossible for outsiders to communicate with them too, because you just get called a shill.

Fun times in crypto land."
"There's two ways to take it.

First, core developers suppressed opposition and killed the 2x increase by having their lackeys wear hats and post online.

Second, core developers mostly opposed the 2x increase, and community members supported their position by wearing hats and posting online.

Core critics tend to believe that blockstream has spent their $70+ million dollars astroturfing so they can destroy or profit from bitcoin (or both).

Core supporters tend to believe that core developers are largely independent actors, and that bitcoin has benefitted both from blockstream's investment, and from the extremely conservative consensus requirement for code changes.

Both camps seem remarkably drawn to building massive conspiracy theories based largely on the implicit assumption that their opponent is a homogeneous army working under tight (but never evidenced) control of a couple evil leaders.

"Those people are just idiots. The fact of the matter is simply this: The demand for transactions has surpassed the blocksize capacity. Do you think those poor people who don't have enough system requirements to validate the block have enough money to pay the current transaction fees?

"Yeah so censorship is a good thing?? If they're moderating our concerns we should speak only louder.

3. This is the same feeling the community has had for over 3 years. That at some point Core will just have to add a blocksize increase. They've made agreements to do this. They've pulled out of agreements to do this. They've stalled. They've done everything in their power to nurture and impression that sometime soon everything would be fixed and yet the chain is now more broken than ever.

"> > Bitcoin Core seemed to be opposed to Segwit

From what I recall, Core developers seemed be attempting another indefinite stall on Segwit; claiming they may adopt it at some indeterminate time in the future, echoing their statements for a block size increase.  Popular user node support for BIP 148 then forced Core to reluctantly accept it.  But Core is still dragging their feet, with no UI for segwit in the Core client even now.  They seem determined to keep transaction fees as high as possible, by any means possible."
Not centralisation, it's appeal to authority. And the BCH crowd is just as guilty.
Yes, if we HAVE to talk in sound bytes... :)
They won't. Didn't you read all the propaganda about how hard forks should be avoided at all cost and soft-forks are the way forward? Segwit is the block increase. That no one is using it is seen by /u/nullc as evidence that a bigger blocksize is not really desired by the community.

Five or six of the major miners that agreed to the HKA would mine Bitcoin Unlimited blocks within weeks (the first such within *days,*) which were clients that voted for a consensus-breaking hard forks via coinbase messages, *ie.* exactly what they agreed not to do.

"No, I don't think so.

I didn't buy a Pepsi when I wanted a Coke.

Instead it's as if I really loved the flavor of Pepsi, and I told everyone how awesome Pepsi is. It was delicious! Way better than anything else on the market! You had to try it!

Then, one day Pepsi got bought by some coprophiles (look it up) who thought that the best way to improve my favorite drink was to add shit to it. Like, literal feces. In a soft drink. It was awful. They called it ""seg-shit"" and *they* said it was the best thing ever. 

Evidently Pepsi wasn't for actually *drinking* more, it was a ""store of value."" The latest theory is that aluminum cans with shit in them are collectible or something (don't ask me, as far as I'm concerned it didn't make any sense).

Whenever anyone pointed out that human feces do not constitute a taste explosion, and maybe should be removed were banned from all Pepsi forums.

Then a group of people got together and called themselves ""Better Pepsi"" and said ""hey, let's try taking out the shit."" 

It's true that if you want to enjoy a beverage without the turds you can now buy a Better Pepsi.

However, For years we were all extolling the virtues of Pepsi, and there's a long web history of all the amazing reasons we really should be drinking Pepsi. People say, ""Hey weren't you really into Pepsi? You told me all about how awesome it is, but when I went to try it, it well, it tasted like shit! What's up with that?"" 

Additionally, squadrons of Financial gurus that have never enjoyed a soft drink (they stick with Perrier and Scotch) discuss the financials of Pepsi regularly without actually seeming to realize or acknowledge that Pepsi's products are made entirely from raw sewage. 

These assholes have made liars out of early adopters, and on top of that they give a long string of reasons why the shit is a *good thing*. Then they get their giant propaganda department to call Better Pepsi ""B.Pee."" and laugh like drunken hyenas about it.

So no, even though I'm now drinking Better Pepsi and enjoying the taste of a soft drink without shit in it, I'm still a bit angry about this.

Given the circumstances, I think that suggesting that maybe -- just maybe -- we shouldn't include shit in soft drinks is not unreasonable.

TLDR; If your company took a great product that I once loved and made it shit, I have every right to criticize that decision even if I have now found a better replacement.

[Further note, in case anyone here suffers from a clinical disorder making them immune to sarcasm and metaphor: Pepsi is an analaogy for Blockstream here. I actually like Pepsi and drink Pepsi regularly. To the best of my knowledge, their products do not include any feces.]

Personally I would like BTC blocks to be even smaller. I think Core is on a great path right now to doing this via a market-driven soft-fork. Drive everyone away from BTC so that there aren't enough people using it anymore to fill up 1MB blocks and boom you've got smaller blocks. To quote /u/Egon_1: #winning.
I think this analogy is incomplete. Lots of us held btc until it became clear what was happening. Blockstream and all. Lots of us got rid of our btc and hold bch now. I think we are in awe of how insanely of the track the btc has come. All the original ideas are gone. It is the complete opposite of what it was and could have been. It's clear that development is following some other outside interest. They are now selling years old cola with no sparks or fizz.

Yes but the current mission of Bitcoin Core (BTC) is to become a settlement layer for L2 transaction layers in which ""any person"" can individually validate the entire chain. Core has been super consistent for years now that this is the strategy and that last bit (that ""anyone"" can validate the chain) has been hammered home again and again.

You have to understand the mission before you can design strategies for improvement.

Since the mission of Bitcoin Core (BTC) is to be ""as easy for anyone to validate as possible"" then things like ""increasing the block size"" and ""lowering the block generation time"" and ""sharding"" are *not* ""improvements"" but *degradations*.

These are all strategies that would bee seen as improvements on BCH, but that's because BCH has pretty much *the opposite mission* as BTC."

"Hm you might be right. [I found this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6edi6l/bitcoin_core_developers_discussion_on_bip148_uasf/di9ie3p/) with Greg Maxwell (u/nullc) seemingly coming out against UASF. He was [doing quite a bit of doubletalk](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6c9meo/bitcoin_core_dev_greg_maxwell_supports_uasf/) from the looks of it though so that he could drum up something like UASF later when he needed it. I think this is because Greg was hoping to be able to ultimately drop the 1.7 MB blocksize increase part of Segwit once layer 2 was closer to coming out.

It's still a bit misleading your suggestion that Segwit is anything but Core's product that they pitched as a way to scale the chain."
">The reasons for rejecting XT, Unlimited, *et al.* to ABC, trace back to the HKA and is cited as the split by many on both sides.

And what was the reason to refuse those proposals? You said political reasons, care to elaborate?

>Neither SFs nor HFs can use either just to miner or just the nodes. Both require some of either.  I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that SFs only involve miners.

If a miner control more than 51% of the hash power, he can apply any soft fork that he want, because he has enough computational power to orphans any block that don’t respect his rules (obviously very dangerous).

Regarding an HF even if a miner has 100% hash power your node will reject the chain, so HF requires both miner and nodes cooperation (much safer)."

Haha, sure dude. totally different things 😉😉
I expect they did need Segwit eventually, but were deliberately stalling until other aspects of Lightening were ready to deploy, to force fees to even more astronomical heights.  The USAF forced them to accept Segwit sooner than planned.

That has nothing to do with the discussion.

>A Soft Fork can only add more rules.

Why did t is good?

Uuh the title of this post is not **Please stop being of the opinion that BTC needs larger blocks** but I guess that fact is just totally lost on you
"The Core chain represents the total victory of the Core team over anyone who asked them to do anything or make any compromise that wasn't part of the road-map they envisioned. The failure of Segwit2x was the last of the efforts over a period of 3 years by the Bitcoin community, its users and the businesses that help form its ecosystem, to convince the Core team to make one small compromise, one tiny little compromise by supplying slightly bigger blocks to buy time for layer 2 and Segwit adoption. This was thrown out the window. And here we are.

So I'm not exactly worried that Core is going to wake up and raise the blocksize. They've proven over 3 years that they can do whatever they want with impunity, and what they want and what their users want is misaligned. I am worried though that users who don't know their history don't understand what they're buying when they are buying BTC. when they are buying BTC. They are not buying Bitcoin the electronic cash system of Satoshi's whitepaper. They are buying Greg Maxwell's 1 megabyte with rent-extracting sidechains coin. That's why I support an even smaller blocksize cap for BTC. Let's make the blocks smaller and clear confusion. "
"Yes but the block size is only one small part of the puzzle.

BCH most importantly fires the devs that got us into this strategic clusterfuck in the first place.

You can like one or the other for its branding, history, company values, employees, price, environmental impact, market penetration, etc etc. There is nothing wrong voicing your opinion to improve one of those aspects. 

Personally i think BCH is superior to BTC.  I still want BTC to improve with bigger blocks to combat the ridiculous fees. Nobody in this thread seems to be able to explain why it is wrong to say that. Although the title is ""stop saying ""Increase the block size""""

I don't think we have to be afraid for Core raising the blocksize limit. However when people keep asking for that everybody will know something is wrong. I am just trying to get as many people to switch camps. Because eventually enough people will be forced to switch anyway and the congestion on the core chain will go away.  But they should completely die, I don't want them to survive and I sure as hell don't want them to ever again be trusted again by anybody. "

Your question is moot.  For every can of Pepsi that your Coke was transformed from, you got another free can of Coke also.
"Yes the fun think about Bitcoin use to be that any developer, even those without money, could have an idea and build on top of Bitcoin. Anything build on top of Bitcoin can be layer 2, when not everything is done on chain. Tippr is  layer 2. Yours is layer 1. Both should always be possible and should be affordable for anybody. Otherwise Bitcoin will start discriminating based upon how much money somebody has. 

Now don't forget that WE  don't have to be maximalists. How many people can dogecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash together serve before all three of them have a problem and need to ramp it up? Well, the demand needs to come firsts .... it's pointless to say

""hur hur hur, A doest not work because B years from now it's going to have scaling problem so let's stick with C"" 

(but C works even worse then A)

Yeah well, let's just try  .... there will be enough smart people to think a little bit ahead. 

But the base layer that people are going to build upon needs to stay open. I have been asking Core to raise the blocksize for a while know, knowing very well they will never do that because they have to admit defeat first ... which I don't think is humanly possible.
So what is the danger? That bad actors again will try to infiltrate the crypto communities and try to make us all fight each other. 

There for there is not better weapon for us right now to build strong communities where enough people trust each other and where certain handles build up enough reputation that there will aways be enough trust to trust them over bad actors that will come. 
Let's not make the same mistake again, decent politics and leadership is going to be needed. The code and math can work without it but communities simply can not.  People are the weakest link and will always be the cheapest to attack. We have seen how a character assassination on Gavin was attempted. I would not be surprised if Craig Wright is a bad actor. I also trust Eric Voorhees over Roger Ver but Roger is kind of doing an okay job. Then there are the moderators here that are doing a splendid job with standing attack after attack from the bad actors. But those attacks are only going to become worse.  Already I think there is a lot of goodwill between the three big crypto communities, dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. (it's also nice to have something like shapeshift now)

Let's all put in an afford and hopefully the community is now stronger then 4 years ago and we will be able to move forwards toward more adaptation and a ecosystem with a healthy growth. We will always be fighting from behind because we want crypto to be open and accessible to as many people for as long as possible. 

"
"That's a perfectly reasonable reply, and because that's your position, I doubt you're clamoring for an increase in block size so much as watching how the two strategies play out.

If you're hedging, then you *want* each coin to pursue a *different* strategy.  If you thought that there was actually one strategy that was better, you wouldn't be hedging in the first place, or asking one coin to be more like the other one, but instead you'd just move your holdings to the coin with the preferred strategy."
I can't afford to hold something that I cannot transfer anywhere without loosing a big chunk of it. I sold all of it for CAD. All my Bitcoin Cash I have comes from the community and from my own content. Oh and from the coins I had before august. 
"> 1. Satoshi proposes in 2010

That didn’t happen. Jeff Garzik proposed increasing the limit in 2010 and published a code snippet that would let nodes do so. Satoshi explicitly asked people *not* to run that incompatible code and suggested that a blocksize *could be* incorporated at a later date via fairly simple delayed hard-fork logic. 

**Satoshi did not try to increase the blocksize limit in 2010 and saying that he did is deliberately dishonest.** I know you know this stuff u/jessquit so why the fuck do you keep lying to people?"
"Good info Jessquit.  When researching Bitcoin I stumbled across all these previous Bitcoin forks, but I'm pretty sure many are unaware.

maybe not forks, maybe you'd call them implementations?"
And there's nothing wrong with being undecided or wanting to profit the most out of both. If you're undecided you actually should have both.
It could maybe make sense to better balance the portfolio.
"There are so many reasons I actively advocate against increasing the block size on BTC.  It’s this period of necessity that will really drive the change.  

It’s as if global oil production was running low, and this was finally getting some real traction to develop alternative fuels... but then suddenly we discover a massive oil reservoir that can last another 10 years.  I don’t want that.  I want the pain to be so bad that we have no choice but to finally switch to offchain scaling on BTC. "
"It is a very interesting phenomenon. The blocksize was arbitrarily set to 1MB. Now some people want to have it higher and some want it to stay the same. I wonder why noone ( outside of 1-2 people who are completely mental) wants to decrease it.

If 1MB in fact is better than 20MB, 8MB, 2MB or 1.1MB... Maybe 0.9MB is the way to go. Or perhaps 0.5MB?

The only reason you should really use GDAX is to funnel fiat into BTC, BCH, ETH, or LTC although there are other exchanges you can do this on that are less bot heavy. After you have any of these 4 just take it to an exchange which has pairs you’re interested in. GDAX is too centralized and very limited, no point in keeping crypto on there.
">everybody could have placed sell orders of their BCH, credited to them after the fork, way before the market opened.

How? No one knew the listing was happening that day.

"Yeah I actually agree with this.  I just thought Brian Armstrong could have had.. stronger arms.  And come up with a press release saying ""Shut the fuck up! It wasn't insider trading!""

Isn't holding onto the bch they have also insider trading by that logic? They know the price will go up so they don't sell. 
"No, it's not really front running.  Front running is a term that goes back to the days of pre-electronic trading where the order books were actual physical things and it was really possible to put your orders in first if you worked at an exchange.   

That's pretty much what frontrunning is -- getting your order in because you have knowledge of some big order that will happen in the future.

And yes, while frontrunning is very serious...

I don't see what happened at coinbase as frontrunning, even.  It's technically possible to do frontrunning on an e-exchange but these days it matters far less.

And let's not forget coinbase is trading commodities (BCH, BTC, ETC, LTC) -- for which the rule are less strict than securities.  Although not unheard of, in general insider trading rules aren't applied to commodities markets.  In fact I think only 1 person ever has been sanctioned for commodity insider trading. 

https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/12/04/the-first-insider-trader-in-commodities/

I dunno.  To me this speaks of some ignorant people being ignorant, really.  I'm surprised that the Coinbase CEO took the bait.

I do think in general it's a good policy for Coinbase internally to limit or prohibit its employees trading activities, perhaps.  That's their choice.

But if they do or do not -- even if it feels really unfair -- cryptos are commodities and coinbase is a commodities exchange.

"
"Whether or not insider trading is stupid is a different question altogether (with interesting arguments on both sides)...

What they did isn't insider trading.  I'm really really surprised the Coinbase CEO doesn't know this.

Now, his own internal policy on trading can be whatever the fuck he wants it to be, fair enough.

But keep your shit in-house.  Yell at your employees or discipline them.  Don't go crying to the press ""insider trading!"" when it isn't.

Makes no sense to me.  Brian Armstrong is a fuckwit sometimes, as much as I love his company.

Sadly Coinbase/GDAX did in fact block it by halting the trading and giving BScore a day to slander Coinbase/GDAX and to promote selling as much BCH as possible to prevent the price from raising.

Doesn't sound fishy at all... Coinbase is crap,  Bitstamp has also BCH
Downvoted for stating the obvious lol

The thing is that they are not even selling the BCH. Bashing this currency really hides the actual shortcomings of Bitcoin and what it could be. They can not voice those problems and their opinions so those ultimately end up as a form of aggression to other types of cryptocurrencies.
Great advice!
I used https://wex.nz to get my BCH.... if that's any help

Um... you realize bots don’t have their own money, right?

I’m an FX guy and for sure thought you were full of shit that the CFTC doesn’t prosecute this kind of stuff like the witch hunt that is FX market making. But you’re right, they don’t. Crazy shit. 
My manager just retired at 38 after 7 years in crypto. He sold all his BTC to cash out but is still holding all of his BCH from the fork and told me he might even buy more.
A bot.
On GDAX I only have USD/BCH, and being from U.K. I don’t have USD so can’t trade for BCH yet :(
But they could not know that those orders were coming in. I mean, they could infer that it was likely but until they see those orders occurring, that's not front-running (and even then, not if they're only following).
"Right, that's what frontrunning is.  And right that at a bank employees can't frontrun.  No respectable exchange would allow that.  It's bad for business if it gets out, for one, and is illegal.

But -- I don't think anyone alleged that anybody engaged in frontrunning.  The specific allegation was that coinbase employees bought BCH ahead of the coinbase accouncement ( be it on their exchange or on other exchanges ).   That's not illegal in a commodities market.
"
Yes, they're market orders. Which is why you should always set the price you want to buy at instead of letting it choose the cheapest sell order. 
Nah, Bitstamp has Bcash. Fuck them. Never forget.
I thought there would be a sell off at 300 bringing the price down. Regrets. It seems a significant portion of bitcoin users are still just holding BCH.
sure you did, aham
Yeah, I know. Well, it came back to this price and stayed very close for some time, then ripple bankster token sucked the market like a vampire.
Imagine the poor sucker with a market order at $9500... 😕
Yep! Buy Litecoin, Ripple or Doge or whatever and use Shapeshift to convert it into BCH
Couldnt you buy BTC with EUR and sell for USD and then buy BCH?
do you see BTC/BCH and USD/BTC? then you are all set. But either way, why wait on GDAX? I used some other exchange to get mine.
There is only 1 market from for bch on gdax. It just may be the USD/bch. 
Front running is trading ahead of a client order. You can argue both ways in this case as there was no guarantee that orders would be on the bid side. At a traditional bank or brokerage employees wouldn’t be able to touch it with a 10ft pole under current best practices.

Until doomsday
The problem was caused by stupid users placing Market Buy Orders.
I understand that but unless I'm missing something about the graph, those orders are being placed after the price had already shot up.
That was on news of SegWit2X failure, which probably influenced Coinbase/GDAX's decision. 
I love how many of them were trying to say it was because BCH has flaws in its code, then cried market manipulation in the same breath.
For a buy market order to move up the price you obviously need people selling, price wont move without execution.
Oh my god. That is crazy. I think I am turning back some of my alt profits to BCH.
[deleted]
lets see if they rig if to coincide with the BTC diff adjustment in like 3 days
14th Jan or around then I remember reading somewhere.. 
Given the price people were paying more like insanity. I had no intention of selling BCH until I saw the price and was confident I could just buy more back later. Unfortunately, I din't see it until about a half hour after release and quickly discovered that profit was not going to be realized.

"I don't think it signifies anything other than a market with no liquidity. Why is it that every other exchange has bch in the 2-3k mark? Why has the price not soared to 9k again after trading resumed?

what a crock of lies. who will go to jail for this wash trading? probably no one, because the government is dumb enough to ban vigilantism but not theft. oh well. 
WHY ARE YOU YELLING?!?
">On November 13th, 2017, employees were notified of the decision to support BCH trading and were explicitly prohibited from buying and selling BCH.

Obviously they announced to employees only after they finished filling their own buy orders. Bitcoin Cash started exploding up to ~$2800 on November 10th."
"""Bitcoin Cash implementation spills Picasso’s painting supplies.

The ‘Picasso’ bot appears to be extremely aggressive in how it trades, this aggressiveness was fully exposed with Coinbase adding Bitcoin Cash to their exchange.

This bot, within minutes, drove the price of Bitcoin Cash to 200+% higher than the rest of the market, due to the order books being practically empty, only stopping with another giant ask wall (which also could have been the Picasso bot).


$20 bucks says the buy orders and sell orders belong to the same person.
I believe that the reason we saw Bitcoin Cash start out trading like this, several hundred percent higher than the rest of the market, is because the tape painting bot was unleashed on this trading pair too early.

With empty orderbooks, within minutes it drove the price to as high as $9,500. It was so bad that Coinbase had to suspend trading, interestingly, they also suspended trading on December 7th, 2017 when this bot went wild as well, driving Bitcoin prices thousands of dollars ahead of the rest of the market.

Notice how there is a buy order for 95 Bitcoin Cash at $8500. No human being would have entered this order on GDAX. This was a tape painting bot specifically designed to inflate prices.

Coinbase should investigate the account which placed these buy orders, because in my opinion they were not bona-fide orders made by a trader but by a bot trying to manipulate prices, which is a violation of Coinbases Term’s of Service.


This bot has also caused them an extraordinary amount of PR damage and accusations of possible insider trading.""

A lot were bots though. No one would be paying 8100 dollars for Bitcoin Cash when the entire world market was agreeing in a 3-3.5k price. And yet again its fallen 50% from its peak. Im sorry but BCH`s price is the most manipulated ever.
"Very true. Rick Falvinge discusses this exact same thing here:

Prime example of how you can turn every fact into something that’s to your advantage... How about the simple idea that there weren’t enough sell order because nobody had BCH in their Gdax account yet? But no, you make it sound like people were willing to pay 9000. No, they put in market orders, which is always dumb in these circumstances.

Unfortunately since they were not liquid enough they brought down the average price each time they halted trading.
"The stash dried out because no one had a chance to deposit BCH or put it up for sale before trading started. Liquidity was absolute shit. 

If those 3 minutes reflected real supply and demand the price would have spiked back to those ridiculous numbers when trading re-opened, but it went nowhere even close. "

Sadly GDAX still hasn't put EUR/BCH back on yet so no chance for me !
"but... but... wasn't everyone supose to dump their ""bcash"" for ""real"" bitcoin  soon as coinbase released the coins?  /s

lol, that is the narrative being spammed at the time."
"The thing that I don't get is coinbase employees buying BCH does not fit the definition of insider trading.  

Insider trading would be if the coinbase employees bought/sold COINBASE stock, not BCH, which is a third party commodity (as defined by US law).  US law treats cryptos as commodities and/or property, not securities.  Why doesn't the coinbase CEO get this before being an alarmist?

I get that he has to chastise his own employess for violating their own internal policy -- but what the employees did is not illegal.  He should have kept his shit in-house and not announced to the world that Coinbase employees were doing insider trading (they weren't as far as the rest of the world outside of coinbase is concerned).

It makes no sense to me that they would cry ""insider trading"" thus throwing some shade on all cryptos.  We already suffer from a slight image problem with the mainstream -- this did not help.

I don t think there is any good reason not to start the Euro/BCH and the Pound/BCH pairs tomorrow, just make sure you announce it so that there is enough liquidity.
"Also on insider trading: if any coin base employees who know about the launch decided not to sell their bch, then that would be insider trading as well. But no one would’ve noticed.

My BCH deposit at gdax cleared ~10 seconds before trading began - there was a long wait (variance) on a block at that exact moment. Good times!
How did you manage to do that? It lasted 3 minutes.
For real....Haha the bots on gdax. So apparent if you spend any amount of time day trading on gdax.   Every one who reads this: why would you day trade on gdax? I don't, at least not anymore
But they still have credited the BCH of the BTC owners on their platform. 
"buy btc with eur and then convert btc to bch.

"False, everybody could have placed sell orders of their BCH, credited to them after the fork, way before the market opened.

Liquidity was shit because no one wanted to sell their BCH.

Those 3 minutes didn't reflect, obviously, but because bots elsewhere didn't have the time to synchronize with that API since it went down with the frozen price but zero volume. Every time something like this happens the price crashes.

Maybe you also think that it was the conspirators and picasso bots that drove the price to the moon in bithumb and bittrex and elsewhere after segwit2x cancellation. Funny that same thing happened, bithumb and bittrex crashed and the price went down."

Insider trading is a misnomer. It is more akin to front running which is equally prohibited. At its core employees had price sensitive information that was not public and thus should not be allowed to trade on that market. 
"Do we even know what the employees did? Did they do anything at all?

AFAIK all this fuss was this army troll of core chills shouting ""scam"", ""insider trading"", ""picasso bot"" all over the place. No one else came up with such asinine accusations.

The post mode allowed everyone too see the orders, so there was complete transparency in that."
"What I find most entertaining is the very people crying insider trading are largely those that also screamed that BCH would crash the moment trading opened.  Can't have it both ways, buddy.

I do think there's potentially an issue akin to insider trading here, but I also see no evidence that it occurred."
