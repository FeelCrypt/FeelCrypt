The problem is that there is already so much real money invested in Bitcoin. I don't think it's in their interest to see the price drop, which would most likely happen if everybody jumps ship and swaps Bitcoin for some other alt coin. Switching from Myspace to FB has basically zero cost, but everybody abandoning Bitcoin will essentially render the Bitcoins they already held worthless, i.e. it's quite impossible for the whole community to swap Bitcoin out while the last person out, or even the people just a tad late to the switch, still get the same price as the first person who initiated the switch. Thus they would likely just act together and keep the price.
"I think the point is that it likely isn't serving the purpose it was originally envisioned to serve, i.e. as the free currency for the masses. But it's serving another purpose, that is value preservation for the rich, and maybe also as an easy way for money laundering and funding illicit activities. In that sense people are definitely not ""getting rich for nothing"". Its technical properties are very real and people are utilizing them."
I disagree. Otherwise they couldn't provide enough tethers in time of great demand or redeem them when a lot of holders sell.
Other traders deposit Tether at the exchange.  I very much doubt that Kraken make their own market buy directly from Tether.  
"Look at https://www.kraken.com/charts for USDT/USD and you can see some walls at 0.97, 0.99, 1.02 and 1.03
Tether price (on that exchange) is set by trades not by Kraken.  

Note, the most you can move there without affecting the price by more than 1 cent is around $300K.  "
