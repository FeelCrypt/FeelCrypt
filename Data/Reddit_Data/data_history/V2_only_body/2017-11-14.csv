Go back in time and get in on the pump and dump with Ver and Wu. Its too late now as the dump is in progress.

"I believe cryptos are the future and are a totally new paradigm of currency, similar to the switch from a barter system to a money system. But I don't think it will bring as many negatives as you think. 

>total break down of all the supply chains

Which supply chains? Financial ones? Of course, but people will still make things. The greater economy as a whole will continue on. Goods will be produced and transactions will be made, on whatever medium is most convenient. Wall street may go down, but new systems of capital investment, like ICOs, will take its place. And it won't happen simultaneously or instaneously. It will be fast, for sure, but relatively tractable.

>End of total taxation

Cash, as it is, is anonymous and untraceable, that doesn't stop governments from being able to tax people. Sure, there is a black market, but the majority of people still pay taxes. 

I do agree that it is all very scary. I can't be certain of what is going to happen, but I'm not so pessimistic about it. I think it can be the start of a lot of very good things as well. The one thing that scares me the most is the idea of autonomous systems taking control of the economy in even small but appreciable ways, and runaway algorithms leading to unpredictable crises. We like to think that the decentralization of finances because of cryptos can prevent this but I actually think, in some ways, it may make it more susceptible. Idk, just some of my thoughts."
"If core devs wouldn't have implemented good speed improvements, you couldn't even sync the blockchain anymore without waiting weeks.  
And low fees, what if we had full 8mb blocks and a 3TB blockchain, would you still cry and demand bigger blocks from the core devs just so you can pay your coffee for 0$ fee like Roger promised?"
"Monero's claim to fame is privacy.  Unlike most blockchains (Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin, etc), the sender address, receiver address, and amount are not visible to the network.  This makes Monero fungible, where any one unit is indistinguishable from any other, like cash.

Main pros:

- Grass-roots open source project just like Bitcoin
- Mandatory privacy enforces strict fungibility across the entire network
- Limited supply of 18.4 million units mined until 2022 when it becomes 0.6 XMR mined per 2-minute block forever.  See [supply emission curve](https://imgur.com/a/De0G2).
- Dynamic block size supports future growth so it should not run into the scaling debate that Bitcoin had
- Strong development team, one of the most active in the cryptocurrency space
- Seeing dark net market adoption; likely a good speculative vehicle
- Features coming soon^tm: more mobile wallets, multisig, kovri to hide your ip, sub-addresses, payment processors
- Community has a weekly [""Skepticism Sunday""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/76iczg/skepticism_sunday_what_concerns_you_about_monero/?st=j9zoyd6r&sh=0cd09bf1) to address its biggest weaknesses.
- Auditable supply
- No founder's fee
- No trusted setup

This is unlike Zcash, its largest competitor:

- Centralized development under one company
- Founder's fee of 20%
- Trusted setup; we trust the Zcash developers to have destroyed 'toxic waste' at creation else they can create infinite Zcash
- Supply is not auditable, so if anyone creates more Zcash, it will not be known
- Optional privacy; very few transactions are shielded in practice which compromises all fungibility
- Shielded transactions require intense computing power which take minutes to make on modern, non-mobile hardware"
"Interesting.  I especially like that a. you guys look for criticism and b. your lead maintainer 'fluffy pony' participates in the Reddit discussions (I've never seen laanwj on reddit...)

"He claims he paid it to some company called Slickage Studios run by a couple of college students at the University of Honolulu and that it is all spent now.  If you look into the owner of Slickage Studios he bought an $800,000 luxury condo in 2015.  Just a couple years prior the guy was living in a really dumpy apartment and was a student. The Slickage Studios address has now been changed to the law offices of some real estate attorney and there is no sign that they are ever going to make any attempt to improve the BitcoinTalk forum software.

All this is verifiable if you go look at the Hawaii State Business records database and property sales records on Zillow.

Hell yes it's fishy because you can develop a kick ass forum platform in a month or so with $100K, easy.  It's a *forum* not a *search engine*.  I've built forums from scratch on my own spare time before.  It's one of the simplest web apps to build.  Practically a ""Hello World!"" project."

If the intention and the effect is to remove posts from view it is obviously a form a censorship. Not in the same league as r/bitcoin, of course, but still censorship. In fact, it is one of the most annoying attributes of r/btc, the typical r/btc post is usually bashing something that the r/bitcoin sphere has done. And when you've read that bashing the first thing you want to read is the relevant small blocker defending their side. Which you usually have to search for a long time withing the hidden comments due to everyone downvoting relevant posts from people they don't like and upvoting irrelevant posts from people they like. 
Not really. 100k USD signup or a full time job which will actually scale withe ruse of bitcoin?

I watched the whole thing play out in real time and it's still kind of surreal for me every time I see one of these old posts. Because it's easy to forget the history and start to imagine that r/bitcoin has always been a huge pro-Core circle jerk. But that's not the case at all. In fact, there was a time when it was overwhelmingly supportive of on-chain scaling.  The systematic and *relentless* censorship and debate manipulation were shockingly and disturbingly effective at completely transforming the sub. 
"Just a quick word of caution: reading that post now, out of the context of the time, makes it sound more extreme than you might think was necessary. People were calling for everyone to immediately ""upgrade"" to XT without understanding the implications. There was literally a post where someone was asking for technical help on how to get their Bitcoin node to sync faster and someone responded that their node was ""out of date"" and to download Bitcoin XT, even though that obviously wouldn't resolve the problem.

You also couldn't even question the technical details of XT without getting heavily downvoted because you appeared to be getting in the way of ""progress"". People who were being upvoted in support of XT were also generally not adding anything new to the discussion. It was an extremely one-sided environment where good points from the opposition were being drowned out and ignored, and debunked claims from supporters kept being mindlessly repeated.

This post is a good toned down example of that. People keep posting it every few weeks and people who have more insight into the claim get tired of refuting it. Count up real quick how many opposing voices you see in this thread, then count up the number of posts that call for pitchforks without providing any extra details about why pitchforks are needed. Compare that to the number of useful anti-theymos posts like /u/jessquit's below. Once you do that, you should have a slightly better understanding of the context. Just remember, it was that x10.

Hope that helps!"
That's not how the law works.
"/u/huntingisland ^(oh shit sorry for the harrassment!) confused the subreddit where u/thieflar was defending censorship. It was here as posted further down:

Mentioning someone on Reddit is a feature not a bug. Also a feature is the block button. Make good use of it. Good luck in your massive censorship and coverup endeavors in /r/bitcoin which by the way is deplorable and makes you complicit in the mounting and overwhelming evidence showing /u/theymos is embezzling funds generated on BitcoinTalk and Reddit which he has pocketed (aka misappropriated) for his own use. 
"My apologies, [you were actually over on /r/ethereum justifying censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7cev3n/just_a_matter_of_time_before_people_realize/dpqq63z/?st=j9zwgzoc&sh=ee789d0b). I made the mistake of thinking you had done it on /r/btc.

"Harassing people on reddit is absolutely against the Terms of Service. While it is technically possible to block users manually, the egregious use of sockpuppets that this subreddit is so notorious for renders this approach almost entirely ineffective. Also, it's mildly satisfying to get the offending parties banned site-wide (even if it is only temporary), which is the inevitable result of continued harassment if you persist after having been asked politely to stop.

You might not like the rules of reddit, but you're subject to them regardless when you use the platform. Now, for the final time: **please stop harassing me**."
Is selling an account like that against Reddit policy?
Geez, this guy thinks he's Matt Damon, when he's really Scott Winters

Bah com'on mate, open your eyes don't play dumb
"I believe you are wrong however I'm not a lawyer (and I assume you aren't either, right?). But theymos did make a promise for something in return for contributions made to the forum. Whether or not that was in the form of a donation or not to me doesn't make much difference. There was clear wording from theymos that if you donated funds in return he would provide a new custom built forum. There was a very specific cause for the funds to be used for which he has to this day failed to do.

**A scam is a scam is a scam**. Whether or not the funds were charitable in nature or more malicious which may be in this case, where it's actually not a donation but the people were scammed out of their money under the guise of ""donations."" If theymos actually had a 501c3 nonprofit maybe he could say it was donations. However, to make matters worse for him, he does not have a charitable tax status so technically no funds were ""donated"" in the eyes of the IRS. Theymos does live in the United States I remind you.

"He is the top mod on rbitcoin, so other mods can't do much. The reddit site admins are fully aware of what is happening but seem to be okay with it.

As for other sites - most people don't have any idea what is going on. When you have some of the top places that people end up when searching for bitcoin, and you censor anything you don't agree with, you can control what people know."
The is the top mod (with a sock account now though) and no one can remove him, but he has changed what r\bitcoin is about away from bitcoin a a very spefic viewpoint and when new users seaech reddit for bitcoin they find that subreddit and learn lies as truth and then turn into idoits if they can't be bothered to look op facts from not reddit
">Why don't people stop using the sites owned by theymos?

For the same reason people usually are not leaving Scientology. 

r/bitcoin has become a cult. All posts not conforming to the agenda of the mods (which are handpicked by theymos) are removed. So new Bitcoin users are indoctrinated from the moment they land on the sub. Rebellious users are banned.

Yeah people develop great software for $0 a month. Pretty pathetic when these big companies and well funded people can't.
They have the financial institutions for that
Good point.  Facebook's initial investment was $500,000 from Peter Thiel. They turned that into a billion dollar company.  Theymos is rumored to have paid slickage double that, $1 million and he didn't even get a t-shirt to show for it.
"If he never claimed it was for a charitable organization, then it wasn't a donation. People can say ""donate to my [whatever]"" its not charity, because they aren't a 501c3 or similar and they don't claim to be. You just gave a gift. There is no contract or sale implied. They might say they are going to use the money for something, but you've got next to nothing enforceable. Certainly not enforceable as donation fraud. They might have defrauded you, but good luck proving that it was there intent to do so. They can say they wasted the money in pursuit of their goal and since you have no owner-interest in the goal, you can't even sue them for failing to use the resources effectively like a stock holder or investor can.

Don't give away money on the internet in exchange for promises."

I have done no such thing, and also stop harassing me or you will be reported to reddit admins.
"Interesting. Can you make this test? Post:

""I prefer bitcoin cash because it is censorship resistant"" somewhere that is not the thread I see in your personal history. Then check in a logged out browser after a bit. You can delete it if you don't believe it, just a test. Thanks! :)

Also, if you have the patience, a pure autohide of comments test with keywords from a year back:

""/r/btc/ AXA unlimited censor censorship""

Thanks!

This only matters if it was spent immediately or purposely held for their own gain. It all must be used since that bitcoin was meant to aid the project. Honestly if the donators don't care how they used it then there's no problem here other than him getting blocked for asking a very valid question. If any *legitimate* donators have a problem with this they should at least show proof the money was at least mostly spent and not held.

Shit... that's actually a brilliant theory. 
"Isn't that how donations work, you stick money in a bucket and hope for the best?

Otherwise, you'd be using a legit platform to do these things to have proper tracking and such."
The mo' you know...
Theymos has been involved in Bitcoin since the early days. Not sure what he did with the money, maybe he's keeping it in reserve for future campaigns, but 6900 BTC is chump change for guys who have been there since 2010.
"Welcome!

/u/tippr $0.50"
You just figured this out... man some people are gonna lose some money because of Core.
Scaling debate aside, I think everyone can agree that Thermos is a shady fuck. If they're being honest.
This should be re posted. EVERYWHERE. HELL IVE BEEN BANNED 3 times from there for posting things just like this. Hence my Reddit account only days old. Hahahaha 
Thank you!
You're the rare exception.
I don't see Roger censoring any threads.
not censoring, you can view all threads, downvoted or not
So is nobody that donated going to call the FBI and IRS on his dumbass?
This sub is so cringey lol
rbtc is the only general bitcoin discussion subreddit
"Really? I was looking at it wondering what the response would be... and they just remove it like that? Unbelievable.

"all started here

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/

we've been trying to wake people up for years now"
Insane how Theymos has pocketed this 6900 BTC + BCH, but even more insane how he instantly deletes a post that even mentions it without even replying. I refreshed the page and the post was gone. If I hadn't witnessed it I'd never have believed it.
Eh, 9 new bitcoin mods need a salary to ban you guys 24/7 so yeah, some funds appropriation had to happen. /s
"It wasn't bashing Bitcoin it was asking how 6000 BTC were spent.

The people who gave the money hav all been banned for asking."
"Good bot!

(gyazo sucks)"
"A lot of people felt like it was, but no one has come up with a smoking gun.  The issue is there was basically zero accountability.  Everyone just had to take Theymos' word for it that he was doing what he said.  Even if you take him at his word that he was paying 100k a month to have forum software developed it seemed fishy because that is a huge amount of money to be paying to a company that is little more than a couple of college students.  They did eventually post some opensource code on Github but it was never used to upgrade bitcointalk.  

So you have this situation where everyone has plausible deniability and all the victims were only defrauded of a smallish amount of money so it isn't worth anyone's time to put a lot of effort into taking these guys down.  But the owner of slickage almost certainly made out on the deal who knows what was in it for Theymos maybe he really was dumb enough to pay that much money and get almost literally nothing in return.  One of the people involved eventually ended up at Blockstream so perhaps there were some behind the scenes favors being traded and now Blockstream controls the three most historically important Bitcoin information sources and the rest is history so you tell me what happened."
"Probably is. Maybe if people that donated and can provide the FBI and IRS with coin addresses to investigate Theymos would not be a problem anymore.

Bitcoin is designed to resist government intrusion, that dosesn't mean laws just stop existing for bitcoin holders.

Law enforcement isn't in the business of being proactive, you have to pressure them."
Because the money was collected as a donation? I don't know.
"He could say, failed business attempt. The only way to know for sure is investigate or probably serve a lawsuit, if you were a donor, for miss appropriation of funds; assuming Theymos is in a country were they uphold those laws regardless of what type of currency is used. The lawsuit, based on a judges discretion, would provide the issuance of a subpoena for him to bring forward information on were the money went and what it was spent on."
The more you Moe, the Moe you know.
It would also pay for a lot of low wage people in the third world to use a VPN and talking points to try and flood social media with false information

"Congratulations, you earned my downvote by lying about how Reddit works. Downvotes are not censorship and do not remove anybody's posts. No downvote prevents a post from being read and no downvote can remove or delete a post. You can read any downvoted post without restriction, and those posts are not censored in any way.

Censorship prevents you from accessing a message. Downvotes don't prevent you from anything. Downvotes are not censorship and every time someone says that it is, they get my downvote - and appropriately so, according to the Reddiquette, because such complaints are *off topic* and *counterproductive*."
"I hate both r/btc and r/bitcoin but I must admit that now I hate r/bitcoin on a whole new level. This is ground for lawsuit, if anyone has any knowledge of what to file for they should inform the community so that something can be done.

Seriously people, just go on r/cryptocurrency if you want reasonable discussions and not this stupid war and censorship (r/btc also censors but with downvotes)

EDIT: Thanks everyone who corrected me on the meaning of censorship. r/btc is not censoring. However, I do maintain that it is impossible to have the opposing view than that of the sub on BTC vs BCH and not get downvotes to oblivion. I also maintain that the war mongering mentality of people here is as bad as the one from people on the other sub. 

EDIT2: [An example of downvoting from the other sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy430/21_hours_still_zero_confirmations/?st=JA02VM6T&sh=41fc144f). To the people that come from r/bitcoin and think people here are all peaceful and honest, you're wrong. There is a staggering amount of human stupidity on both sides. Both sides are conducting a war, both using different tools, but both sides are trying to manipulate and deceive. It's just that one of them is doing it in a more subtle manner by looking forthcoming, friendly, anti-censorship, etc. I reiterate that you should go to the r/cryptocurrency megathread if you want reasonable discussion with knowledgeable people with different opinions that are not part of this dangerous war."
"downvotes isn't censorship it's how reddit works

"In all fairness, bitcoin was nowhere near $7000 until recently. BCH wasn't even a twinkle in Vers eye. 

While I agree the funds appear to have been used poorly, when you're talking about donations in what 2012 or 2013, bitcoin was a lot cheaper, I think the real estimate was about $600,000. 

It doesn't help your cause to blatantly spout nonsense all the time. 

If you bought a packet of weed off the DNM in 2012 for 1 bitcoin/$20, you can't really expect to go asking the seller for $6980 change _now_.  Bitcoin spent in the past is worth what it was at the time. "

Why bitcoin cash over litecoin or etherium?
Sorry, pretty sure the price crashed man. 2500$ to 1300$ right now is a crash
i am sorry but i completely disagree with your statement. This isn’t about store of value, it is about adoption. You don’t get to where it is used as an everyday payment overnight but it is much closer now than it has ever been. There are cryptocurrencies accepted at many in person retailers. It is accepted at Microsoft, newegg, overstock and many other online stores. There are debit type cards that utalize cryptocurrency to make payments. Gambling sites are adopting cryptocurrency. Saying it is just a store of value is crippling the greatest technological innovation since the internet. i plan to make this my everyday payment system as soon as possible. If i could ditch cash tomorrow I️ would
Then they say they are too poor to afford larger nodes...Dafuq?
"Oh okay, I get it then. So this is just another case of people honestly thinking that BTC or BCH can be as common as a VISA payment within just a couple years from now. 

It's crazy how many people are so caught up in which coin is better because it will be better for spending, but in reality, that's really far off and in the moment it's 100% about each coin as a store of value and what would gain people the most fiat $ in the short term if they completed liquidated their position.

People want to say, I have 5BCH, I used $1000 to get that but I basically made $6000 (or whatever - depending on current price) if I sold it all right now. 

people really need to wake up and understand that no one is planning on making this their day-to-day payment system for a long while. Yes, the devs and other people supporting the coin have to tout what's good about their coin as far as future value, but in this very moment, it's all about each coin as a store of value. How are people not getting that? You think someone who can make $50k by moving their position from BTC to BCH this very week (or even vice-versa) really gives a fuck that BCH is the apparent better coin for the future. No, they wanted the $50k dude, the fact that they moved to the ""right"" chain is not of any fucking concern to them. If they cared about the right chain for what coin is going to be the future of payments, then people are saying they would literally sell off BTC even if it was more valuable in the moment, just to be on the right coin - even if it isn't currently worth more to them in financial terms.

What I mean is, you really think someone who say is assumiing BCH will tank to..lets say $500, is going to sell everything they have in BTC and say that would net them a $20,000 loss, just to get BCH just because in many years BCH should be worth way more?

Fuck no dude. They will hold onto or buy more of whatever is making them worth more NOW. They can worry later about what coin is better for payments, and at that time, that coin would be the hot coin, so they would switch anyway. You go where the money is hot, not where the fucking tech is going to be the best for the plan 20 years down the road, jesus christ. Use your heads people. It's about the fucking MONEY.

That's ludi"
thats easy ... just use RBF to enter a bidding war with banks and other large companies. And don't forget to keep up to 100 dollars free in case bidding gets out of hand and you're about to lose your LN prepaid funds.
Then whats the poiny of using this instead of fiat?
"LOL. It costs no fee at all to exchange the BTC for LTC or any other altcoin on the exchange. You simply select the exchange, click Buy, type in the amount of BTC you want to exchange, and place the order.

You fucking delusional idiot. Unless you are using coinbase and not gdax, which in that case you are an even bigger idiot.

what are you going to report me for? telling the truth about what it costs to make transactions on the exchange and calling you a name? never been called a name on the internet before? lol, what a fucking baby you are.

"
"> some people pay just a bit more, don't know why

Couldn't this be said for bitcoin too? It's a free market, plenty of people paying more than they need to, either knowingly or not."
Wrong again. Scaling linearly with increasing block size isn’t the solution. You need a system which is exponentially scalable like lightning network. It takes time to get there. These bcash people are distracting people with this scalability bullshit and take away market cap from bitcoin. They don’t even have highly skilled devs like the core team. Marketing only gets you to some extent, this is a battle of technology. They will fail.
its easy to check if Bitcoin is not for you ... if you're complaining it's not for you     /s
Sure sure, got you tagged you can go now
Well, one can make an educated guess based on current past and current events. 
 alright man, you got it.
Hey I'm really new to crypto and wondered, what's the difference between BCH and another transaction currency like LTC, DASH, XMR, etc? I mean other than the privacy part, aren't those still lower fees than BTC?
I think you are missing the point. High fees are driven by your boy who is controlling the miners. 
"https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-much-average-aggregate-revenue-is-generated-annually-by-high-frequency-trading-firms 
They don't make a lot at ALL."
In total, they trade $37 trillion worth of stocks in a year, and make ~$1.4 billion profit.
"You certainly seem to know what you're talking about and I respect your provision of actual examples. I think our difference of opinion is a difference of terminology. That is, there's a difference between algorithmic trading, such as carried out by many hedge funds - like Rennaissance and, as you say Numerai etc, and High Frequency Trading (HFT) that we are talking about here. 

Actual HFT does not incorporate TA because it is about responding incredibly fast to simple market moving information (preferably actual trades placed at other exchanges) and typically does (can not) incorporate any type of complex analysis of that information into the algorithm. Complex algorithms such as Neural Networks or TA simply cannot be made to run within the ~microsecond response time that characterizes HFT. HFT latency can be in the ball park of a microsecond [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17256040/how-fast-is-state-of-the-art-hft-trading-systems-today) whereas neural networks take in the ballpark of a few milliseconds to run [source](https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks) - even in feedfowward, non training mode, never mind actual online training - which is to say ANNs are thousands of times slower than HFT latencies require. 

More to the point, in practice, while yes HFT are, a sub class of algorithmic trading, the vast majority of actual HFT applications utilize only very simple algorithms that can be run in thousandths of a millisecond ballpark range, meaning they are about getting data where it needs to be as fast as possible and utilizing very simple trading strategies on that data within a very short time period."
Yes but they don't have the wide acceptance of BTC. Granted, neither does BCH but because it's a fork of BTC it should be easy to add as a payment option. Also, since everyone who had BTC received the same amount of BCH, the ownership of BCH is more widespread than LTC/DASH/XMR (probably). 
I suggest researching. Im off
Sometimes, they make money. Sometimes, they make a *lot* of money. Eventually, though, they lose money. In the case of a houseful of geniuses like Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), they might lose so much that they almost collapse the global economy.
I think that number needs more context. Like, 1.4b return on what investment. If that investment was in an index fund, what return would it get. Etc. The fact that they are profitable says that to at least some capacity it is working, but it needs a comparison to make sense. Do you know if they're beating the index?
But the mining is way more centralized is it not? Maybe not as much as DASH, but I thought LTC was very decentralized 
No,  seriously dude, high fees are driven by mining centralization. 
Uh I guess they're doing pretty well compared to the market in general or they wouldn't exist. My point is they're not predicting where stocks will go accurately. They take advantage of absolutely tiny discrepancies between stock prices where their models estimate there shouldn't be any. They move $37 trillion around to make $1.4 billion profit. It's not super efficient.
How does mining centralization lead to high fees?
"but it's not 37 trillion dollars in capital right?  it's a smaller amount of capital being cycled through 37 trillion worth of stocks very quickly by computers unless i misunderstand
"
"Yea it is 

Probably about $10 billion total"
Seems appropriate for the Liquid(tm) network.

They are often complex machine learning algorithms using historic data, sentiment analysis on social media, trending topics, and trends within the market to predict outcomes, but strategies vary widely. Due to the nature of machine learning no two algorithms have the same weighting to each of these factors. This means they are all unique unless explicitly copied. This is true for all algorithms that are using a neural net. Examples of these are the algorithms that quantopian and numerai seek out. I'm sure the kind you're talking about exist, but it may not be fair to generalize and say they are all doing what you are saying.
How do I do that? Any useful links?
"Sure, the supply side is constrained and works only on transaction size (and the segwit rebate), but we still have the demand side, and large value, urgent transactions will pay more. Some pay more than necessary for a bitcoin transaction, the last weeks I have paid max on electrum myself, a bit higher than recommended on https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ See also my other comment, the fees on bitcoincash is currently around 0.08 USD.

"Lighting Network has been on the notes for what two years now? Kek.

Look up their revenues recently

The fees aren't that high if you don't care if it goes into the next few blocks. 
Exactly! I am a student and it would be ideal if I could buy like $10 to $20 worth Bitcoin at a time, but the fees of transferring that to my own wallet makes that impossible. That's what stops me from buying more.
Mayby some people's intention is really not for 'store of value' of average person but still is a good 'store of value' of the banking hub.
That's the whole point behind having a block size limit. You can't have someone go off and decide if a tx is spam or not as then like you said censorship becomes an issue. So what is needed is to limit transaction capacity to make it cost prohibitive to spam. This way as a user I must make a decision on my own terms if the tx is worth it for me to pay for or not. This way it addresses the issue of spam while being censorship resistant. But let's face it 1 MB is just way to small because then not only do you cut out spam, you cut out of the market people that want to legitimately use Bitcoin.
I know I'm just making a point. Who's to say what's spam or not if they pay a high enough fee to get into the block? Is an onchain tip bot spam?

"Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto to never have full blocks. some people took control of the code and changed that so the elgacy bitcoin always has full blocks.

Bitcoin (cash) will use computer science to progress so that blocks are never full, second layers like LNs and sidechains can be added to Bitcoin (cash) so it can grow if needed.

But there is no reason to think bitcoin can't grow on chain with technology and user adoption so that it keeps working like it was designed, like Bitcoin (cash) works now."
Exactly. Why are bigger blocks a scalable solution?
"2x was an attempt at compromise by giving both sides what they want.

The problem was that it was a bad compromise. The complex segwit upgrade went first, because few people seriously thought that the meagre 2MB block-size increase 3 months later would be blocked.

There were some [warning signs](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/72mrfs/segwit_eli5_pls/dnjug06/), however. That was why Bitcoin Cash was conceived as a contingency plan.

Defend Core all you want. Just make honest, logical arguments.
"It's not about increasing speed it's about decreasing back log. Small blocks or big blocks if confirmation times are 10 minutes the speed is just the same, the difference is capacity. If you don't bid your way to the front of the line you are stuck waiting in line so you have to wait a long time to get a confirmation. Well with BTC it costs you $20 to get to the front of the line, with BCH it costs you $0.30. With BTC if you don't pay a premium price you're waiting several hours, with BCH if you don't you might get unlikely and need to wait an extra 10 minutes.


Segwit2x wasn't bad, it was the best solution preposed at the time. The thing is Core was against if and Core wants power rather than other development teams having influence in the direction of Bitcoin. Core has a loyal fallowing. This was enough to make it so the the Segwit2x hard fork would of been contentious and led to two coins being created, the intent was to gain consensus and then it'd just be a nice smooth update. It couldn't get that consensus so those who orchestrated the deal backed out saying we'll just leave BTC as is. "

This is definitely not well known. Nobody should, and likely does, know how much BTC they hold. I find it hard to believe that people who voluntarily contributed many many hours to core in 2009-2013 do not own BTC and worship USD. Does not make sense to me. 
"Sorry, hard to believe. You become a target if you admit to own a lot, so there are good reasons, and I would advice the same: to openly admit to hold 'little'. 

Maybe they hold little with respect to some, but it is hard to believe to work on bitcoin in 2010-2013, in a very different idealistic community, without holding any BTC.

"> Consider the fact that we are fast approaching the 21 million limit. When that happens, miners are going to mine for the free.

The issuance halves every 4 years. It will be about 15 years until the block reward drops below 1 coin (from 1.5625 to 0.78125).

Right now, the BTC block reward is 12.5 coins. Consider that if blocks held 32MB, the transaction fees for a block could be 12.5 coins, with everyone paying just 40 sat/byte. (Or, with a 1MB block, the fees could still be 12.5 coins, if everyone paid 1250 sat/byte. We've had at least one such block already.) Miners have _no problem_ getting paid as the issuance decreases, and they already make a significant percentage from fees today. All they need is either fees or transaction volume to increase appropriately as the issuance goes down. The caps on those two things are, respectively, what a user is willing to pay, and how many transactions can be claimed in a single block."

>The problem with the Core proposed solution is that it is not ""add more capacity to the network"" but rather ""completely circumvent the network by only referencing back to it occasionally, taking your actual business off the network"". When you give someone the opportunity to profit from being a middleman, he will take it. That sounds way too much like middlemen meddling up a system for no reason. There's enough middlemen, payment processors, and people who take a cut along the way without the addition of an entirely new class of them.

Miners are a way the middlemen. Without their blessings we cannot move our crypto. Adding nodes from LN would just add another ""middlemen"". Even BCH is going to need to add this kind of middleman eventually. Remember in early days, spending BTC was almost free. Today BCH feels like this. But come 8 years from now, it won't feel like this with BCH anymore. Consider the fact that we are fast approaching  the 21 million limit. When that happens, miners are going to mine for the free. No more block rewards. So do you think Jihan and people are going to run massive data centers for measly network fees? I don't think so. They will only do so if fee makes it worth while. Transaction volume quaruples when no more block reward are given, and if fee remains affordable like BCH is now, then Jihan would be making only $.04 instead of $.01. Do you think he's gonna continue to mine and  confirm transaction. 

This problem will afflict all cryptos when block rewards are no more. Not just BCH or BTC. 

In the next 5 years, BTC and BCH will be fine. I worry about the future after that. "

"The problem was certainly pushed back. It became critical around 256kb and was pushed back at least 10x. Last I heard, tests of the fibre network showed some signs of delayed propagation again around 50x. Unfortunately, there are delays and packet losses that routinely occur on the internet that are exacerbated by block size but aren't eliminated with small blocks.

The new paper on even smaller blocks (starts with a 'G') might well give us another 3x, or the block size might no longer be dominating propagation delay. In particular, since blocks are being sent by simply referencing entries in the current mempool, delay in transaction propagation becomes just as limiting as delay in thin block propagation. As the number of transactions per block increases, so does the number of transactions one miner might include in a block that a second miner won't have before he receives the super high priority, directly transmitted (from pool to pool) block/list of pointers.

Anyway, this led to another round of quotes you can find with core devs agreeing to a 2x hard fork before they found a way to kludge a block size increase into their soft fork.

I can't prove any specific person isn't compromised by evil bankers, but let's at least all be aware that there's a damn good reason developers suddenly changed their opinions on the roadmap of block size increases!"

Forcing people to pay $100 and wait 72 hours to send $7, is forcing shops to drop Bitcoin support and is damaging the growth of Bitcoin.

For Bitcoin to grow, it's important for users and shops to be able to continue to use it.

Wider support means more interests, more talents, more developments.

There is virtually no difference in hardware and bandwidth requirements between 1MB and 2MB blocks.

Shops have already been dropping Bitcoin support due to the congestion caused by 1MB blocks, there is no valid reason to refuse to implement 2MB, and sit around for another ""18 months"" to argue over how to scale Bitcoin to some bullshit massive number in the far future.

"Segwit alone only had ~30% support at it's high before the S2x compromise.  Pinning it's delayed adoption on Bitmain is nonsense they only control ~18% of the network hash rate.

The whole asicboost fiasco was little more than a smear campaign by core against a company that has done as much for Bitcoin as any.  Segwit doesn't stop asicboost.  There are two asicboost methods the more efficient of which is still possible with Segwit you were lied to.  There is also no evidence that asicboost was ever used by Bitmain or anyone else.

Core has very little credibility left on scaling issues. Prior to segwit activation they claimed that everyone was ready to immediately implement it when it was activated.

"Indeed, there are other good arguments against using the segwit soft fork approach. There's little question though that bitmain led a lot of mining opposition. Pretending that mining pools and operations don't have a vested interest in keeping their sole supply of mining hardware happy is a bit too simplistic for me.

Please cut the rhetoric about being lied to. I understand that overt asicboost has not been used on the bitcoin blockchain. I understand that jihan claims not to use any asicboost on the blockchain. I also note that antpool has a really remarkable signature of putting out blocks with transactions out of fee order. This is a signature that makes no sense and doesn't show up in other pools to remotely the same extent (i.e. some pools might accelerate transactions by putting them first, but they wouldn't have the scrambled transaction order that antpool routinely pumps out).

That is evidence. It's hardly conclusive, but nobody ever claimed to be that they could prove covert asicboost was being used (that's the whole reason it's called convert) so I disagree that I've been lied to!

Yes, segwit adoption has been far slower than I'd expected. It's been far slower than indicated by that self reported chart.

But now you're claiming that core developers are less credible on the technical details of Bitcoin scaling because a couple of them put together a list of big players, somebody else linked to a public statement from bittrex in a pull request saying they were ready for segwit, and a couple months later bittrex is still using legacy addresses for withdrawals and deposits?

But back to the OP, none of this remotely suggests that the core developers positions were influenced by VC funding. My comments certainly don't prove a negative, but that's my point. We don't have to get super hyperbolic, claiming someone is lying or lied to, or are being corrupted by bankers when they happen to change their position on scaling in response to a critical failure in Bitcoin mining decentralization everybody seems to have forgotten about!"
First, 6 dollar fee per transaction is negligible amount if you entered into bitcoin in early days (and you will return something from a miner cause you are in tandem with him, aren’t you?).  Second, you can have different tactics to rise an average fee by fooling bad fee estimation algorithms: slow a blockchain, make a lot of spam transaction, some occasional empty blocks. Voilà, you have a 500sat/B average fee.
Of course not. But if one complains to vary high fees during a **particular** moment in time recently, it’s fair to point to an actual cause, isn’t it?
">I hate this factional bullshit.

Then stop posting them.

>Segwit has not ""fucked up"" bitcoin.

Yes it has, by creating unnecessary technical baggage.

>If nothing else it fixes transaction malleability

You don't need Segwit for that, it can be fixed cleanly with a simple patch, instead of a massive change to the protocol.

>and slightly improves capacity.

Only if everyone's stupid enough to use it, even then you still only get 1.7MB.

>Segwit is strictly an improvement.

Segwit is a banking cancer.

"The salient point is that the Core devs will say and do anything to get there way.  They have a vested interest in causing congestion on the Bitcoin block chain to push people into second layer solutions where they plan to make their money.

Prior to them having this vested interest they had no such opposition to block size increases.  The new facts that you say came to light to change their mind don't even support your position because they show that a 2MB increase would have been fine from a technical stand point.  The fact that the block size is 1MB right now was an arbitrary choice in the beginning it was 32MB."
Yes, I'm sure it is all one big conspiracy.
"Yes, it's more than fair. I think everyone agrees that mining profitability is why miners temporarily switched.

Mining profitability and other chains' features have _nothing_ to do with why the Bitcoin network is allowed to operate with virtually no headroom to accommodate any periods of high demand. Indeed, similar backlogs predate BCH existing."
"I know that's the position of many of their detractors.

But this entire thread is an accusation that they changed this specific position based solely on receiving VC funding, when in fact there's a year's worth of discussion on the ghash.io problem that lead to their opposition to scaling beyond the 2MB equivalent enabled by segwit. That's just not justified here, even if they're as terrible as you say based on other, unrelated changes in their technical arguments."
"Let’s suppose it is not.

Blockchain is a breakthrough technology, I think both you and I can agreed on that?

Speaking of Bitcoin, we know that once coin-issuance is slowed down (let’s say 19mln of 21mln are mined) mining won’t be subsidized solely by the system itself, instead users of the system should pay miners by means of a transaction fee (let’s call this original vision as this is quite a popular term nowadays).

Here we come to an interning situation: this is such a young brakethrough technology that there is no blockchain in existence that successfully surpassed it’s coin-issuance stage. We never observed such a blockchain.

We can compare this to a situation where the are thousands of startups with a lot of venture capital but none of them showed any profits yet. Everyone just believes that these startups will continue their existence somehow.

C’mon man. I miss those days when everyone was so passionate about this new form of money. Now there are different conspiracies. This is shit.

"
The other reason I don't buy your argument is that Segwit is actually LESS efficient with bandwidth that a simple block size increase.  So if network issues were causing centralization then segwit is worse than a block size increase.
"Yeah, I miss those days to.  Don't look at me though Core killed the good vibes by their childish stubbornness and refusal to make even a minor compromise and then pulling all sorts of dirty underhanded crap in the process.

What's done is done though and so long as those Blockstream dudes are in charge Bitcoin is screwed."
"Which argument don't you buy?

Yes, segwit transactions are larger. Yes, this makes the problem of large blocks slightly worse. That's a trade-off for their soft forking strategy to fix transaction malleability etc.

I personally think in hindsight that was a poor decision. I wish they'd just embraced a hard fork and done it all more cleanly from the start.

But they didn't. I'm happy to criticize them for that, but again, it's tangential to my argument here that the core developers changed their quoted views on block size due to the centralization driven by problems with block propagation that became a crisis for the entire network, not solely based on a company's solicitation for seed funding from venture capital groups as claimed by the OP."
You pointed at me when I told you about the cause of high transaction fee by saying that I am quoting conspiracy, yet you ended with just another conspiracy. Good vibes aren’t killed, just tune in your receiver. Don’t forget to turn on beforehand and drop out afterwards :)
Bigger blocks are bad because they cause an increased orphan rate due to higher network bandwidth usage and lead to centralization.

"segregated witness can not be considered an improvement by almost any measure except very short term, and it even failed to do that. 


No segregated witness changes core concepts of bitcoin, was rejects by the community and maintainers of Bitcoin until lies were used and then still it offers no major benefits and incoudes major dangers.


We can *clearly* see that the community rejected segregated witness, I've never discussed it with a supporter who either knew anything about bitcoin or fully understood segregated witness. I note that you have lllooootttt of downvotes by me in RES so I assume you don't know anything about bitcoin either. "
"> It is irrelevant what merchants demand, they have to have their business models to fit fiat, not crypto. 

LOL just what kind of fucked up business model can fit $100 fee transactions that takes 72 hours to send $7?

And you have the audacity to pretend you have a ""master degree from a prestigious business school"".

Bullshit you have, you're a minimum wage typewriter monkey hired by Blockstream Core to talk bullshit in a PR sweatshop all day for a living."
This is what I can't understand. If people want bitcoin to really take off, then a lot more people need to use it than the current number. One of the easiest ways to do this is to get the shops to accept it, which is in essence free advertising. If it were me controlling the shots I'd be jumping through hoops to keep them happy!
Where is a source that shops are abandoning Bitcoin?  I'm trying to get informed and this would be actual evidence in the face of hearsay by both sides.

I know there are big players waiting to get in, but are holding back because of scalability problems. It's why they're flirting with centralized approaches.
I recently had a transaction I didn’t care about take almost 3 days to confirm the fee I had to pay was still in excess of $6.  The trend is clear and nothing is being done to reverse it.
Great system!
ABC is also just the reference client. BU and XT are headed by well known BTC legends. Also, many devs in the past have been anonymous... Satoshi for example. There's nothing wrong with it unlike some would like you to believe.
Except that people didn't fuck it up with Segwit, they improved it. They fucked it up by not upping the block size too, the marker agrees. Notice how before Segwit2x got cancelled Segwit2x futures were trading at 2-3x the value of BCH's price?

"> Did you just complete ignore the fact that I said long-term?

No I think you are wrong, shared experiences to back up my assumption. 

non the less no one is suggesting we ignore all possibilities in the long term.

The discussion is about what to do today this year and for the next 10 years. long term **Bitcoin rewards go to 0** so transactions have to be on the blockchain to secure the network. 

>When the coin is handling as many transactions as we hope it will, the vast majority will not be able to run a full node because of the massive size.

the vast majority don't need to run a node, the system was not designed for that - if the vast majority of users ran a node we would need much longer block times to accommodate for the lag and that model does not scale. **even today the vast majority don't run a node** and do not need to. 

>We will have a centralized system in which only a small minority are running full nodes.

No we wont. having 1GB blocks won't centralize the system but they will accommodate more 10x more transactions than Visa and Mastercaed today.

just do the math stop beveling the shit Core are selling you. "
"segregated witness did nothing to adderss the backlog.

There should never be a backlog.


Satoshi designed Bitcoin so blocks would never be full, and people invested in *that idea*.

Bitcoin cash allows bitcoin to work how it was designed. Segregated witness doesn't do much to improve bitcoin and carries some very dangerous potential pitfalls

segregated witness never got much support, in fact it never got even close to the majoirty support on it's own; it wasn't until they *promised* to >2MB is people would jsut add the complex and unneeded segregated witness code, which they, as predicted, backed out on. 

SEgregated witness could never gain support on it's own merits, lies had to be used to push support, now that it has happened we see almost no benefit. "
Have you not read reddit in the past two years or so? Do some search, you will find the threads with the links and statements. It's pretty much proven, no need to resort to beliefs.
I've been frustrated by the misinformation being thrown back and forth. I've been a die hard BTC guy and I'm now trying to understand the other side. When I saw the statement in quotation marks, I assumed it was a direct quote (we can put aside if that make me an idiot or not). When I realized it was not a direct quote, I felt deceived yet again. Whether you want to believe it, putting quotes around a statement implies it's a direct quote, by who is not relevant. I was appalled by the idea that Bitcoin is not for poor people. But, I'm also appalled by people spreading deception to fulfill their agenda.
"Shit, I just actually read what you said, my bad. You're right the ""Blockstream Core:"" part makes it a fictional dialogue. Damn it. Sorry, I'm just frustrated at trying to slog through all the noise."
"Cool, so it should be trivial for you to replicate those results given how confident you are. I will wager $200, or really any amount you like, that if you send a $7 transaction with a $100 fee from a segwit wallet that it will take less than 72 hours. 

Would you like my wallet address or would you prefer to use escrow? Or are you going to keep running away like the coward you are? Every time you back away you prove you're full of shit. :) Well done!"
"No it doesn't. I'm not impressed with how core handled politics, although their plan to roll out segwit in 2016 probably would have worked well scaling-wise if it hadn't been blocked by a certain mining pool that profits from their patented asicboost!

The core devs would say that they already raised the transaction limit to over 2x the pre segwit level. That's certainly not helping today, before exchanges and wallets fully implement use of segwit addresses, but it could kick in rather quickly when a large exchange enables it.

I started writing out why I'm frustrated with core developers for failing to embrace segwit 2x (by making it their 2x on their terms, not by simply pulling in code they're not happy with), but that's really beside the point.

The point is that tests seem to show the 2x enabled by segwit is safe, and that moving up to 10x would be unsafe.

Do we really want to push mining pools to collapse again before we have a solution in place? 

Reasonable people disagree, that's fine, it's just not some clear indication that core developers flipped position when they were paid off as OP asserts."
Search historical news for acceptance of bitcoin, and see if they still do now.
What other discussions would you like to see?
"Then they will have to wait much more since Core will not scale BTC anytime soon to anything usable.

Even if Core come up with some useful tech scaling I bet miners simply will not want to run that code. And then it will be UASF, PoW drama all over again for BTC... :D"
Did you use a SegWit address?
Was that because of a spam transactions **and** all time low hash-rate on bitcoin blockchain because of this EDA ** bug**on BCash that attracts miners with a short term profitability? 
">Except that people didn't fuck it up with Segwit, they improved it.

lol, still selling the ""Segwit is the scaling solution"" bullshit?

Segwit was confirmed completely useless in the mass BTC to BCH exodus two days ago.

Because there's a market for pizza?
yes, that is BS
"You don't buy that an increasing orphan rate can cause centralization of mining? And this is because core developers increased transaction size by 10%?

Bigger blocks did cause centralization. Developers found a way to reduce block propagation time by referring to the mempool, but nobody thinks this eliminated the problem, it just vastly increased the block size at which miner profit seeking outweighs altruism in keeping the network decentralized.

Intelligent people disagree on precisely the point where block propagation will cause sufficient orphan block rates with current technology to cause the same problem we saw in 2015. That's fair. If you have evidence for your position that propagation delays can no longer cause orphaned blocks on small pools, I'd very much like to see it! "
Fortunately for everyone, that has nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with MasterCard's exploration of the concept of the blockchain.

Failing to scale today have nothing to do with that.

I think that LN will actually under deliver (same as segwit) and Core knows that but they must force users into Ln network and that is why they intentionally cripple BitCoin.  They are forcing users on LN for two possible reasons:

1) control (all transactions will go through controlled/censured hubs)
2) profit (Core will find a way to force users through tech they will first develop and monetize)

Both reasons are very bad.

If anyone see some other reason for 1Mb limit, I’m all ears."
"Then they realized that by making Bitcoin difficult and expensive to use, they could steal Satoshis invention for their own gain.

A full time onslaught that kept the many part time users from seeing through the thin viel they were able to create by controlling the main discussion forums. 

Its both impressive and sad how Blockstream was able to pull this off despite countless exposed lies, reversals, blanket censorship, and baseless attacks of namecalling. "
">If we do 2MB blocks now, does it necessarily mean we HAVE to increase 100 petabyte blocks sometime? Why does this have to be a slippery slope? 

Yup.

Why stop all progress just because today's tech wont work 100 years in the future.

Why do we still drive if we'll run out of the same fuel in 1000 years?

Everything is a slippery slope if you project everything to the extreme.

"
I've yet to see any valid arguments at all the support small or full blocks, no one has been able to find one, why? I don't think they exist
Yeah it's pretty frustrating that Core couldn't just roll out 2mb and heal this divide. But maybe this split is showing that Bitcoin can't be everything to everyone. The present fees are fine for many Bitcoin 'users' as they don't really use it. They just treat it as a store of value or investment (like investing in another scarce resource like property) Personally I think Bitcoin makes a brilliant Store of Value, I never use it as cash or currency except as a party trick, and it doesn't bother me if it never is useful as cash as I have cash already and it works fine. What I don't have is an accessible investment vehicle which I can put any amount into ($10k or $10) and I know I own it and it can't be manipulated or seized and I can take it with me wherever I go.  So I guess Bitcoin is different things to different people which is why you're seeing this divide. 
It's not spam, the whole conspiracy that the blocks on BTC are being spam is just people's congnive dissidence. Is it really that hard to believe that a coin  with a $100+ billion market cap has reached its mesley 3-7 transactions per second limit? Let alone that sure mempool could be spammed but onchain transaction in Bitcoin can't viably do so, [over the past 24 hours the number of fees paid in Bitcoin equate to $4.5 million.](https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees-usd) and growing. Is /r/Bitcoin really high enough to believe that some spammer is throwing million of dollars out the window everyday, for what? But I guess if you post that piece of info in /r/Bitcoin mods will delete  it. 
">  sometime down the line, the block chain itself won't be able to support the 2nd layer settlements

I doubt this as bitcoin *can* work on chain for everyone if we follow the ideas Satoshi proposed.


>s the block chain doesn't scale while still holding the same value and principles.

What do you mean by this? decentralization comes only from mining nodes, more users = more use = more miners will come onboard in many places around the world = greater decentralization; while full blocks mean only very few people can use bitcoin at all.

---


Satoshi laid out the full design of bitcoin, where all people could transact P2P in a trustless manner on a decentralized network and some 100,000 miners all around the world each with big data center style buildings would support the network of many small fee transactions 

- this is the bitcoin we learned about before investing in, this is the bitcoin we signed up for - satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org

>having a small block size won't cut the spam

Satoshi designed bitcoin so the blocks were always empty and would never get full.

"1MB block: $100 fee and 72 hours wait to send $7.

8MB block: $0.2 fee and 10 mins wait to send $7.

Look at Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s mempool, look at the mega clog and insane fee:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/

You can see clearly tx with super high fee gets cleared first, the rest stay stuck at the bottom.

Now look at Bitcoin Cash (BCH)'s mempool:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#24h

All transactions in Bitcoin Cash are cleared EVERY BLOCK regardless of how much fee you pay.

You can pay $0.2 fee or $10000 fee, it'll be cleared just the same, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin Core, where high fee tx gets cleared first.

It's not that bankers own them, it's that they want to become banks. 
"Here's what I heard from pepperidge farm: 

- ATM transactions were originally free (because it was so cool it drew nerds who could be converted to bank customers.)
- ATM transactions became 25¢ (there may have been a brief period of 5¢. Hard to recall now...)
- ATM transactions became a dollar because by using their Machine we experience convenience. And the dollar is a convenience factor. (not cool but well ok) 
- ATM transactions are what they are today. Add additional fee for access to your own money.
"
"So it is not bankers but miners who charge the excessive fees. 

Even if the blocks are 100MB this wouldn't sort out scaling.

How many nodes would be able to run that capacity?

Even if LN is not the credible answer I cannot see anyone offering an alternative workable solution. 

By blaming ""others"" for scaling problem without giving a solution your words are just a noise. "
">""High fee is good because Bitcoin isn't for poor people.""

Holy fuck, this is so damning, imo.

It belies their motive: make money from fee's. This is the exact business model of bankers.

Fuck all the arcane arguments of ""being free from censorship."" Rich people don't have to worry about being censored. It's the not-so-privileged that get continually fucked by the power structure. If core isn't for them, then all it is for is to extract high fee's from the somewhat privileged to give to the very privileged and to hedge against ""the many"" gaining control over the power structure and taking back our wealth that has been siphoned off for decades."

"I am not going in a discussion about spam, difficulty change and the rest that created this backlog. 

It is just smoke and mirrors mate. 

No one saying that 1MB is bigger than 8MB and this is a ridiculous line of discussion. 

I am simply saying that an increase to 8MB solves nothing except increasing possibility of cutting a number of nodes, and the increasing possibility of centralisation in voting rights. 

You say buying 2 years -- to do what?

Big no-no in my vocabulary. "
Can it not be a variable block size? i.e. If 1.1 MB is needed it automatically increases to 1.1MB, if 1.2MB is needed it automatically increases to 1.2MB for the next block. That way after LN gains momentum the blocksize would probably decrease, maybe even to 300KB, who knows. Or is a flexible blocksize not technically workable? I don't understand enough...
"I don't think bankers care about block-size. The many bankers don't even know about block-size and why that matters or doesn't matter. Bankers are supposedly going to own bitcoin. And bankers are going to trade and make money on trade. Having smaller block size works against them. It's preposterous the same industry that goes the financial crisis because they wanted to maximize their profit is going to work against their best interest by keeping block-size small. Having bigger block-size would benefit bankers. They can trade more and make more. 

Or perhaps you think bankers are going to become miners. And keep the block-size small will increase transaction fee and the bankers-cum-miners are going to get those transaction fee? The same can be said about bitcoin cash. Suppose BCH becomes the defacto and the price goes up to $50000/bitcoin. Not only bankers but more new people are going to come in and flood the market with transactions. And the fee will increase. (BCH doesn't have fixed fee for infinity as far as I know.) What happens when BCH has 32mb block and that too is filled? Well come to the same problem. 

I just picked a random BCH transaction - 9092b0e2dd3875b331ddcef1ac276c380ce951dcebb1498d719f873bfb38690f
It has a fee of 0.001132542819499341. That works out to about USD-1.52  (BCH @ $1350). If BCH is at @ $2700, then the fee is $3. If it's @ $5400, then fee is $6. If it's at $11000, fee is at @12. 

Now I picked a random BTC transaction - 31e14d85b4fcc64022c3156cfcedb9df93f484845d93f5f3e3bde905be300f98
It has fee of 0.003. That works out to about USD-19.5 with BTC @ $6500. If btc was $13.50. The fee would be $4. But we know for a fact that the fee is so high now because of consented effort to spam the mempool of BTC. Had there not been this effort, the fee would have been this much. The evidence of that is this: Between last week and this week, BTC didn't gain 50x adoption. Amazon and Walmart or some other big merchant didn't start accepting BTC. And suddely 50 times more people didn't start doing BTC transaction. If you go through the various exchanges, the daily volume of btc trade didn't jump up 50 fold.

At this point, the argument for bch with the block-size and transaction fee is stupid. It's like Republican party and Obamacare. Since the inception of Obamacare, the Republican party has done anything everything to make it not work. And then complain about it not working and then pass more rules and policies to make it not work. 

Same for BCH and BTC. If you are actively making BTC not work through spam transactions, then you cannot complain about it not working. Because you are making it not work. 

Don't ban me. I'm speaking my mind. I hodl both BTC and BCH. Whichever one wins in the end, I win. My ultimate desire would be for both BCH to continue and BTC to continue and for both to go to the moon. Because together that would mean, I am going to Jupiter. :)

* Hard forks aren't Bitcoin
* Let's wait and see how LN releives congestion before determining what is the most appropriate blocksize increase and when
* We can't come to consensus so let's not risk a  contentious hard fork, wait it out until we can gain consensus 

And that's all I can think of. "
">This economic retard has a master degree from a prestigious business school. 

Bullshit, you scream economic retard by completely ignoring the economic side of Bitcoin.

>I will be willing to listen if there is a credible suggestion how to overcome the scaling problem.

Ahh, the ""let's ignore the economics and focus on technical bullshit"" argument again.

I just told you, there is virtually no difference between 1MB and 2MB blocks, Bitcoin Cash is running 8MB blocks just fine. 1G blocks have already proven to work in test labs.

There is no valid reason not to move onto 2MB when merchants are dropping Bitcoin support due to congestion.

The way Blockstream Core does it is by ignoring the fact that:

1) Merchants are dropping support

2) Merchants support are important for Bitcoin to continue to grow.

3) There is virtually no difference between 1MB and 2MB blocks, other than 2MB blocks will clear the congestion today."
"I finally saw an insightful post on the other sub about this.  Explaining their mentality.  They say that expanding blocks ""may relieve the congestion"" but its not a long term solution.  So the more important thing is to reduce block size to keep nodes decentralized.  Then he said:  ""Granted, this doesn't solve the congestion problem"".   I mean.   Okay?   This has to be, in a nutshell, where the disconnect is with these people.  It's just not registering in their brains that there is more than just ""engineering, code, and nodes"" at stake here.  There are end-users, congestion, and usability problems that they're happy to ignore.  Its lunacy."
"The strongest argument for 1MB block I have seen is from Mircea Popescu. He believes that censorship resistance is more important than adoption. 

He wants to be able to hide his Bitcoin transactions with tor or even stenography if need be. He has enough money that he does not really have to worry about the transaction costs. Even at $1000 transaction fees, Bitcoin may still be cheaper than using something like art pieces to transfer value."

Of course it is also good that your funds can't be seized, but plenty of coins offer that, including Bitcoin Cash. So without maintaining its usefulness for everyday payments, Bitcoin is losing a lot of its intrinsic value compared to other coins. If that situation persists (when is the lightning network coming again? and will it even work? who knows?), Bitcoin will not be a good 'store of value' for very long.

The people you are listening to on 'store of value' are not economists. I suggest you completely extricate yourself from these forums, and do some pure research on economics for a while — specifically when it comes to the economics of currencies. Read deeply on the subject without any influence from any kind of bitcoiners: then you can know that you are not getting intentionally biased info. After you believe you know how currencies work economically, come back to these forums and evaluate the arguments in light of your newfound knowledge. I feel confident that you will conclude that Bitcoin *cannot possibly* maintain itself as a 'store of value' for long without rededicating itself to becoming useful for the average person to make payments.

Value doesn't just come out of nowhere. It's based on something. And when it isn't based on something, it eventually collapses."
"Even from the eye of investment I still think a wider users base is more valuable.  Let's say the average block fee is 1.5 coin, let's assuming a hard fork (kidding ..  let time go by into a remote future) with zero block reward, then even with current level mining industry, the price will x9.33 because the price per coin is energy power * 600 / block fee at that time.  Therefore, a smaller block fee will make the price higher.  A wider users base will have a lower block fee for sure; the ticket for cheap (or luxury) club must be cheap (or expensive)."
"I do post a lot on /r/bitcoin , and I understand some of the sentiments and views, that said, I do not understand the following:

* If we do 2MB blocks now, does it necessarily mean we HAVE to increase 100 petabyte blocks sometime? Why does this have to be a slippery slope? Apparently, when the 2nd layer solutions come, we'll begin to see empty blocks, and maybe then we can talk about scaling down, but I doubt it, the 2nd layer settles on the blockchain anyway, and sometime down the line, the block chain itself won't be able to support the 2nd layer settlements, as the usage increases.

* For daily use, we may need 2nd layer solutions, as the block chain doesn't scale while still holding the same value and principles. But, it's not as if Bitcoin is clogged up because people are getting in line Starbucks, so we'll have to, at some point, increase the block size, just to be able to catch up with the current method of use, and in future, to be able to settle what goes on in the 2nd layers. Why not do it quickly, and now?

* The assertion that if there weren't spammers, this wouldn't be problem. Hay, is the solution to spam 1MB blocks, and keeping it that way would reduce spam? I guess not. Why not make it 2MB and make spammers bleed more if that's the case, at least honest transactions will more likely go through. (Whether there's spam or not, the fact of the outstanding transactions is there, and having a small block size won't cut the spam)
"
I agree with you, this doesn't look like spam at all. But they'd like to think that way, but even though if there was legitimate spam, 1MB block wouldn't be an answer, you cannot expect people to behave in a particular manner on a censorship resistant structure. What is spam anyway? If they were to employ a sort of spam detector, if it was at all possible, this would be censorship and completely against the principles of Bitcoin.
"I'm just repeating the narrative on /r/bitcoin, but I don't think accepting there's spam or not changes the fact that we need bigger blocks now.

">Can you blame newcomers to crypto, looking to invest in something, essentially wanting to JOIN a positive and friendly community yet almost all they see is Negativity, Rudeness and Attacks on the other ""side""? 

You mean we're supposed to paint Blockstream Core in positive light when they're clearly breaking Bitcoin? 

The Bitcoin reality is ugly right now due to Blockstream Core, how exactly would you want to spin it?

"It's important to actually use data and quantify how the data supports your conclusion. 

It's been proven that using a $2000 pc today running on a home internet connection in a real world test scenario using the software available today we can do more online bitcoin transactions per second than MasterCard has demand for over peek Christmas shopping.

Looking at the bottlenecks it can be optimized to do 3x that volume. 

That's ignoring the fact technology is going to improve and ger cheaper. 

Centralisation in Bitcoin should be defined as avoiding any form of centralize control or single point of failure. 

Eliminating transaction limits does not results in Bitcoin falling victim to a single point of failure or control."
Yes, because Segregated Bitcoin will scale into Bitcoin Cash. They won't need 1MB anymore. 
The increasing block size also caused miners to start mining on top of blocks without checking if they were actually valid first, which was pretty terrifying at the time and created havoc during the BIP66 softfork on July 4th, 2015. 
Can someone in plain English explain why either solution matters? Like what is the conflict between the two solutions?
"You won't be banned here for your opinions, regardless of their popularity.

What you are failing to see is that Bitcoin transaction demand is _not_ a constant. The amount of people who want to transact Bitcoin varies _heavily_ each day, and _explodes_ whenever there is significant price movement. The backlogs form themselves as a natural consequence of the network constantly running nearly at maximum capacity. Zero new users and zero spam is required to create these circumstances, and you can trivially verify that they have happened in times of high volume... for all of 2017, long before BCH existed.

It is a similar concept to the average RPM of a car motor being under 2000 for any given drive, but there being times where the motor must hit 3000 or 4000 RPM. The Bitcoin network develops massive backlogs due to natural variance if it operates without sufficient headroom. Headroom has been added twice in the past as needed, and Bitcoin survived just fine, with headroom to make it additional years. Now BCH has done it a third time. Either you create enough space in the ledger for every reasonable transaction, or less and less types of transactions will qualify as reasonable.

The problem with the Core proposed solution is that it is not ""add more capacity to the network"" but rather ""completely circumvent the network by only referencing back to it occasionally, taking your actual business off the network"". When you give someone the opportunity to profit from being a middleman, he will take it. That sounds way too much like middlemen meddling up a system for no reason. There's enough middlemen, payment processors, and people who take a cut along the way without the addition of an entirely new class of them.

I choose for all methods of scaling the chain to be worked upon in tandem. Not for the chain to be not scaled, and other solutions built on top of it. The job is widening the river and optimizing its flow, not creating a plumbing system simply to subvert the need to do so."
">I am simply saying that an increase to 8MB solves nothing except increasing possibility of cutting a number of nodes, and the increasing possibility of centralisation in voting rights. 

That's an economic retard argument right there.

Moving to 8MB will allow merchants to continue to support Bitcoin, and allow Bitcoin to increasingly get wider global support. Instead of dropping support for it.

Wider support means more interests, more talents, more developments.

If you look carefully, every Blockstream Core shill talk like an economic retard."
How do you define spam transactions?
"That's exactly what the Bitcoin Unlimited fork was trying to accomplish, it was getting massive support earlier this year, until the banking cartel took over with the Segwit2x scam.

The result of that was the emergency Bitcoin Cash fork, we cloned the original Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash before the banking cartel permanently changed the way the original Bitcoin works.

Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin.

">I told you..you've got not a clue what Bitcoin stands for. 

And you do? What, does Bitcoin stand for ""pay $100 and wait 72 hours to send $7""? GTFO.

Here is the Bitcoin whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Read the title: ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

Why would a ""peer-to-peer cash system"" make you pay $100 and wait 72 hours to send $7.

Look at what Bitcoin was supposed to be before the bankers took it over:

>https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq/#size-bump

>(We don’t expect fees to get as high as the highest seen in this table; they are just provided for reference.)

Now the fee is 7-50 times higher than that.

Bitcoin is broken, Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin."
"Nice try blaming the miners.

>Even if LN is not the credible answer I cannot see anyone offering an alternative workable solution. 

Yes there is, it's call Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

8MB would definitely solve the current problem, for at least 2 more years, enough time to figure out the next step.

But Blockstream Core won't allow it. There is virtually no difference on hardware and bandwidth requirement between 1MB/2MB/4MB, but the bankers just won't let people have access to low cost and efficient Bitcoin.

1MB block: $100 fee and 72 hours wait to send $7.

8MB block: $0.2 fee and 10 mins wait to send $7.

Look at Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s mempool, look at the mega clog and insane fee:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/

You can see clearly tx with super high fee gets cleared first, the rest stay stuck at the bottom.

Now look at Bitcoin Cash (BCH)'s mempool:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#24h

All transactions in Bitcoin Cash are cleared EVERY BLOCK regardless of how much fee you pay.

You can pay $0.2 fee or $10000 fee, it'll be cleared just the same, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin Core, where high fee tx gets cleared first.

"> You can thank the bankers for keeping BTC blocks at 1MB and force you to pay $100 fee and wait 72 hours to send $7.

and end up having mastercard to speed up the transactions by acting as a second layer. They are already [patenting the tech](https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-patent-filings-detail-blockchains-use-speeding-payments/amp/)

"> After becoming banker puppets: Blockstream Core: ""1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB!""

Some of them are talking about block size REDUCTION, aren't they? 1MB is too much. LOL"
1 MB blocksize makes it easier to fire the miners if they misbehave. You need to be able to run a node to PoW fork. Also, small blocks and high fees will prevent the network from becoming insecure once the block reward becomes minimal.
That problem was fixed with xthin a long time ago.
"There are 2 separate issues:

1) Currently it's people paying miners $100+ fees hoping they'd get through first.

2) It's also in Blockstream's road map to make Bitcoin unusable with 1MB blocks, then offer patented side channel services and charge people fee for using it.

Most importantly though, is this is a community effort. We can pool our resources and pull off something amazing.

Lots of people here happy to answer that question in a relevant post. In fact, if you search there are several posts addressing this exact question active right now. 
"You should get BCH if ""I should be able to have money that is supranational, secure, instant, with low usage costs, and for which no one can say when or where I can spend it"" sounds right to you.

The majority of BTC mining is also in China. It just so happens that China had the right people and the right conditions (low electricity costs, plenty of industry, good math education, ...) to make Bitcoin mining flourish. Good for them. It's a permissionless network, others are free to join."
You can submit a PR to the BitcoinCash.org site github or create your own. Anything I believe would work though, such as a Medium post or even better: a Yours.org post where people could donate to the post itself with funds raised going to the cause or and in addition to add the donation info to the post and make that post the marketing page? 
No worries.
Why not both?
Why not PM him the answer instead of making him PAY for the answer!?
Wasn't /u/MemoryDealers floating that idea around at one point? He might have looked into it already and can provide some insight.
Thanks, Also, I keep seeing people mention how BCH is more aligned with satoshi nakamoto's initial vision but not BTC, which aspect are we referring to ? 
Some really good ideas. Thank you. Will do all of that now.
Done. I was just being cautious because I don't want some trolls to get the link, but thinking about it, I'm sure a troll would pay $1 if they really wanted it.
All aspects.
The Yours post needs a QR code to make it easier to scan and donate :) 
Good idea. On it.
"Priorities.  There is no better marketing than being listed in the fiat -> crypto gateways.  We need Coinbase and Gemini to support deposits and withdrawals.  I will have to reconsider my BCH investment if Coinbase comes out by Jan 1 and only lets you withdraw.

Bitcoin Cash has six months or less to complete these objectives:

1 - Get listed on all major fiat exchange gateways in the States and South Korea.

2 - Get most major merchants to follow OverStock.com's switch to Bitcoin Cash.  If BCH is the blockchain for the users, we need to get these customers right away.  There needs to be a plan with funding to achieve this.

3 - Flyers and animated adverts or any other grassroots marketing."

"Litecoin is a scam. Basically just a BTC copy. Mined by one large miner for a long time (Probably Charlie Lee's brother Bobby Lee). Check the rich list for the coin. It will also forever carry the technical debt from Segwit. It doesn't help that Charlie Lee is closely tied to Blockstream and Core. 

Bitcoin Cash was the result of a fair fork. Hence every Bitcoin holder August the 1st also holds Bitcoin Cash, and can choose between them or keep both."

"Asking those places to add Bitcoin Cash isn't just going to cut it though, usually there's technical work involved to make it happen, and they don't want to foot the cost (because let's face it, it's still a novelty thing).

I've suggested that it'd be a lot easier to convince some place that used to support bitcoin (or still supports it, but not bitcoin cash), if you offer them consulting to make it happen (and throw in a few free hours to boot)."

"Quick thing about miner economics:

Lower fees *per individual transaction* is not bad for a miner, if the total number of transactions increases enough to compensate.

Example:

Scenario 1: $5 fee per transaction and 2,000 transactions in a block = $10k total fees

Scenario 2: $1 fee per transaction and 15,000 transactions in a block = $15k total fees

Miners earn more in the second scenario, even though the fees paid for each transaction are lower."

"The censorship issue is something i raised on /r/bitcoin , it seems like they are loosening it up a little, regardless, yes rampant censorship betrays the trust of the people.

Yes that is true, and that is why there is Bitcoin Cash, a fork for those who think the alternative is settled.

At the same time. I do sympathize with the argument for decentralization . A lot of the big block supporters seem “wreckless” in their pursuit of short term gains for their businesses. I hate Bitpay, they are the representative of everything i dislike about the current system. Paypal has tens of thousands of my money frozen. Bitpay regulates it’s merchants, something that follows Paypal’s path.

Jihan does not seem to care that he is monopolizing Bitcoin’s mining in China or that he can hold the network hostage when he wishes. 

These examples are just a few where I feel, the big blockers are supporting the kinds of views Bitcoin was created to remove. Too big to fail, a few people controlling the entire network. If we follow Jihan’s model we might as well go with the PBOC instead.

Big blockers also do not seem to be concerned that a bunch of huge Bitcoin companies and miners came together for a secret agreement in a room (we already forgot about 2008, bankers lobbying to remove derivative regulations?) to change the code. 

In comparison, the only thing Blockstream has done is lack empathy and ability to compromise. Whatever people say, Blockstream may be impeding progress on Bitcoin, but in my mind they are not short term profit seeking.

Censorship resistance is a key value proposition of Bitcoin, and if we lose this property for short term financial gains then we have just returned to the system we were trying to get away from.

Regarding the blocksize increase, i see no reason why a small increase will cause any problems, other than fix them. This is indeed a failure from core, however as i said, because they support decentralization that itself is a worthy goal in my opinion.

"We need both a currency and a store of value, the question is, is it better to have those things separate? Nobody really knows the answer to this, but people SEEM to be using Bitcoin as a store of value more than a currency. Bitcoin Cash maybe the layer 2, we have been waiting for.

Remember this whole idea that the coin value is linked to it’s use case as a currency has never been proven (we are at the frontier here, so who knows). 

Gold has very little use case for normal people, if we measure by use case. The USD is by far the most USEFUL currency in existence, but the value remains on a flatline, and that is a good thing, a currency should not be volatile like an asset class like stocks.

The world wants both, and if both can exist on one currency that would be ideal indeed, however we have no idea how the economics of the future works. For examples these ICO tokens may only be worth money, if they give people company voting rights in the future, who knows?"
"I'm pretty sure there were only a couple of key people in the entire system who opposed SegWit.  I am aware that there are many reddit accounts who oppose it, but I haven't heard from very many notable people.

Would you consider coming onto Whalepool Teamspeak and speaking more about this.  It is a very diverse community, but we rarely hear from people technically opposed to SegWit, although all are welcome.  It makes it seem like there really isn't much actual support for some of these ideas, at least from people willing to speak and not just post things on social media."
"A lot of people talk to me about crypto now. It comes up very frequently. The crypto gods feel like they are knocking directly on my life.

"Exactly. It's hard to fathom how more people don't see through Core's bullshit. Really I think this just shows how strong brand power is; half of the people still rallying for Core are just thinking ""Bitcoin is Bitcoin durrr"".

They literally only have one point ""bigger blocks => centralization"", which is horseshit, and everything else stems from that nonsense. But yea, you hit the nail on the head, Core's refusal to increase the block size *at all* is, at best, extremely suspect. Congrats on unplugging yourself from the matrix, welcome. "

Well that's total bullshit. If you don't think Bitcoin is way bigger then Reddit then you don't get Bitcoin.
Well every day that BCH is around is also another day btc is around so I don't see what days around has to do with anything. Btc is backwards compatible with every client released since the beginning, it is the chain the economic majority is following and if the economic majority want a hard fork they will need to implement and begin using that chain immediately at the split point. You can't just fork some new chain and expect every who has invested in btc since the split point to just lose all of their money. That would destroy everything that made Bitcoin special to begin with.
"I don't know if it occurred to you guys but the reason you get attacks is because you're like a cult over here, brainwashed by a convicted felon who's proven to be wrong many times, yet you still follow him (Ver) and his criminal friends.

I don't like seeing people get suckered into losing their earned money by becoming sheep. That's my motivation for denouncing this crap to as many as possible. It's a pump and dump by a felon. Plain as day. There's no future to it. This pattern plays itself over and over as time goes on, and core/btc ends up on top."
I do understand. What about you?
"AXA does not ""own"" Blockstream, it's just another investor.  Core devs are not Blockstream. Bilderberg is not ruling the world. You fall for conspirancies, you should look to proven facts, asicboost, miner centralization, spreading lies against Segwit, etc. etc. you have been misinformed then and now, so no core supporter."
Even the founders of BCH say its not BTC. This is useless drivel. You are not going to change the minds of the great majority. And in case you are curious about the great majority - like at the price. The market tells us exactly who is BTC and who is not. Stop trying to usurp a brand. Its stupid and childish.
i'm starting to think the simplicity might be best.  maybe i'm wrong but the whole side chains patents thing of blockstream is creepy.  these guys want to become billionaires off side chain fees because they probably own little to no actual bitcoin - and just the fact that making these residuals will guarantee their priesthood and status for several lifetimes.

"How long has bitcoin been around?...as compared to BCH? The latter was born only 3.5 months ago. But yet it has managed this level of market cap, and definitely with legions of supporters. As witnessed by the activities and involvement here.

Some people point to the number of bitcoin transactions which greatly outnumber BCH. Again I'm using the latter's age - how many transactions did bitcoin have when it was 3.5 months old?

I risk being seen as a BCH supporter and anti-bitcoin. The first part is correct but not the second. With me, it's not one or the other but ""going to giving both the chance to show which is better"".

"Increasing the transaction limit will fix that problem. But that opportunity has been lost.

"it's decentralized


I think there is some major misunderstandings going on, fostered by a certain centralzied group.


banks can freeze your funds, limit your txs, limit who who can transact with. Since this power is distributed to many in bitcoin, bitcoin is decentralized and not centralized like current banks are. 

Thus people who use bitcoin are free from the power that banks have voer people."
"Ask away, man.  

BCH is freedom from banks for the same reason the original Bitcoin meant freedom from banks. Decentralization (there's a reason they call it ""central"" banking), fixed supply (can't print-on-demand to bail out greedy criminal behavior), resilient against fiat market manipulation, can't issue it in the form of credit (debt), thereby destroying the fractional reserve model (which ultimately destroys the value of the currency it's built around). BCH is just a continuation of that original protocol."
They are all busy moderating discussion forums.
"Considering [one Core dev](https://vid.me/66PC1) (who [works for](https://blockstream.com/team/luke-dashjr/) Blockstream) barely even knows what Bitcoin does, it's a safe bet that Core is simply doing what they're being told. Btw, it doesn't stop at AXA. Look into [Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/) (*MasterCard has an investment in them*) and their honchos, then consider their investments in BitGo & Blockstream as well. ;)"
"Discard all the conspiracies, and offer benefit of the doubt to the extreme, that Maxwell, Back, Dashjr, Todd ...  all these guys might just genuinely be following what they really believe is the right path.   Set all that aside and assume good faith.    Even grant them perhaps a ""the congestion we have now and the lost businesses and users is worth it in the end"", and simply take a look at what their plan is.   

The plan is to create these second layer solutions, and sell the technology to corporations who will then allow their customers to have blockchain-derivative tokens which they can move about.   They'll move them within the walled garden of the companies 2nd layer, and probably for some fee be able to move them to other companies walled gardens.   If you're rich enough, you can even move them on-chain to your own wallet.    Even taking my own on-chain bias out, I think this is not a controversial description of their intent.   

So now you've got Venmo, Paypal, Apple/Google Pay, Exchanges selling you some product which moves a token around off the blockchain.   Consumers who've never owned Bitcoin will have an app on their phone that lets them move some money to their friends or pay for a coffee.  They'll be able to move their token to an exchange where they can gamble on the price of assets.   In many ways it really will improve the user experience.

But what these users will not get is financial freedom.   The government will track all of their transactions even more effectively than they do with VISA, and be able to confiscate their money, or blacklist anyone who they deem a threat.   Most people will probably be moving tokens which are tied to fiat, so their currency hegemony will also remain unthreatened.     This is the vision behind the small block, off-chain solutions.   

So while I'm also prone to conspiratorial thoughts, even the non-conspiracy is NOT what I signed up for.   I'm not against such a thing existing, that's fine.   Its better than VISA and Paypal are today.   It'll probably make it a bit easier to on-ramp to freedom based cryptos than it is today (though also will make it easier for them to monitor the onramp.)      The case to be made to convert small blockers is to simply make them see clearly the vision that is driving core.   No need for a boogieman when the actual plan speaks for itself.

"
"Core has been doing stuff, they've just been ignoring the elephant in the room.  Let me explain...

Open source software is developed by volunteers.  That means people work on problems that interest them.  An open source project also has a lead maintainer, the main person who decides which patches should be accepted and which shouldn't.  That started as Satoshi, then it was Gavin Andresen, then it was Wladimir van der Laan.  

We go back to 2012.  Gavin has stepped down as lead maintainer, he wants to write code, not do the cat-herding that is being a lead maintainer.  Wladimir becomes lead maintainer.  
Gavin points out that scaling is a problem and we should increase the block size.  Other devs point out this will take a hard fork and has potential to cause problems.  Gavin says it's important so we should do it anyway.  One or two other Core devs say 'I oppose this change'.  Wladimir says 'this is a change to consensus rules, and we don't have a consensus, so we can't make the change.  Keep talking among yourselves'.  And thus the can gets kicked down the road.  

Now for the record, I understand Wladimir's thinking here.  He was playing the role of a custodian, not the role of a leader.  That's perfectly valid, it just wasn't helpful here, especially when some of the anti-hardfork people preventing consensus were people with more extreme views like LukeJr who felt the block size limit should be *reduced*.  

Thus things remained the same for the next few years- because there wasn't a complete consensus, Core wouldn't agree to change the consensus rules.  

That's not to say Core did nothing.  For example, libsecp256k1 (try saying that 5 times fast) replaced OpenSSL as the crypto library, which led to a notable speed increase.  However the real problem didn't get any attention because it had no fix without consensus and there would never be consensus because some Core devs felt the block size limit should not be changed yet or should only be changed with years of advance notice.  "
"> yah i'm wondering what core has been doing all this time

I've been debating here with others against Greg Maxwell and Adam Back  in an insanely amount of time that no CTO and CEO should have spent online. No such thing happened with other CEOs. They were literally just trolling and arguing online.  Delivering nothing. "

"Is Bitcoin the money of the internet, or the internet of money? Why not both! It's a damn shame there are no more bitcoin tip bots around. Bitcoin was never intended to just be a ways of storing value. The problem with that is if the only reason that something has value is because it's a way of storing value ... well it will collapse at some point! Because then then the value of it is entirely based on the belief that it has value. While if something has an application as in: I need bitcoin transaction to work and work smoothly, my business depend on it. 

For bitcoin to be actually used by the masses it will need: 

- To have a benefit that current payment systems don't have, this can be easy of use, low fees, less control by one party, etc etc

- an easy way to get in too it, the higher the fees the higher the threshold to actually buy small amounts and use it as a way of paying for stuff online

- Zero confirmation need to be always around, yes you risk getting scammed but at least it makes bitcoin usable for small payment. 


Yes I know there are other crypto's that do these things better then bitcoin but bitcoin has a massive network effect and an enormous amount of investment in mining equipment. This all protect the system cause it's valuable. But if it becomes over protective just because a few are worried they will loose value ... then it's like an auto immune disease where the body attacks healty parts of itself trying to ""protect"" itself against stuff that is actually good for the body and not bad.

"Though Szabo I respect more, I think he's wrong in supporting Core.

Szabo doesn't have similar views to economic principles guiding Bitcoin as Satoshi did. Also he has said on record that he is not Satoshi.

CSW has totally different personality than Satoshi and also got caught of inserting fake variable in his ""proof"", which makes him a scam.

Both still hold some valid opinions of their own.

It's not some either/or personality contest. People have to judge themselves what kind of system makes sense to them and choose their cryptocurrency accordingly.

Also I hope that we would keep respect for ""the other side"" and not side with people slinging mud and doing charachter assassination. (that is wrong and harmful regardless of their cause) 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion and all ideas should be discussed freely without censorship, ridicule or hostility (all those only stem from fear).

Thanks for having an open mind!
well it's ok.  i don't think there's any value over there at all and anyone with half a brain will not spend much time there.  even as a core supporter i was very rarely there.
"> They buy in to the ""store of value"" concept

Bitcoin's only use is a store of value? OK, fine.

But no one there can answer how or why BCH can't be used as an identical store of value. For that matter, no one can answer why *any* established cryptocurrency like Monero/Litecoin/etc can't be used as a store of value, other than the intangible ""first mover"" effect of Bitcoin."
speculation helps with the price and adoption.  i'm not against it.  but the original mantra is buried beneath a lot of settlement layer talk now.  shame.
"> They buy in to the ""store of value"" concept, where it doesn't matter if you use on-chain transactions. 

The key here is that this concept is fundamentally no different than a Ponzi scheme.  The moment people stop buying, it collapses.  None of us bought into that.  We bought into a financial revolution.  We bought into something fundamentally useful that was nothing like the Ponzi the media called it.

And now Core has turned it into a Ponzi."
this week i have been staring at transactions stuck on the blockchain for days.  they certainly aren't doing enough imo.  
Thank you for sharing! That's an excellent piece of technical writing and a very insightful guide on what may be yet to come.
for bch to overtake the btc hodlers in price there will need to be corporate movement to foster mass adoption.  this is only possible with bch - lightning devs better get cracking. 
oh well that's a relief!  Maxwell i understand is the chief gnome though.
Thanks. I will do more research on this bot thing :)
price rise will certainly help.  my impression is that very few people in the other sub have any significant coins.  lots of posts about i just bought .2 btc!!!  After 3 years I finally have 1 bitcoin.  The vast majority there have little stakes.  So in the end, so what?  They can't move the price anyway.  Whales will move to bch imo.
"I'm in a similar boat. I trashed Hearn to friends when he suggested that we should increase the blocksize and called his plan a ""banker takeover"".

It wasn't until I actually understood how Bitcoin worked that I realized how wrong I was.

Now I'm definitely leaning towards Core as the banker takeover. Keep it valuable, but keep it crippled."
thanks you sir.  i am trying. 
">BCH has something like 95% hashrate from 1 guy

That is false. Hashrate distribution is quite similar on both chains, most miners jump ship to whatever happens to be more profitable. There are only few miners that solely mine one chain. (Slush mines Core chain when less profitable IIRC, BCH side you probably already know.)"
"Maxwell doesn't understand psychology, economics, or markets.  Most of the core developers don't.

Fundamentally what made Bitcoin work when people like Maxwell ""proved"" it was impossible(no joke!) is because it doesn't try to be perfect.  It uses game theory and economics, it doesn't ignore them.

Core ignores it.  They'd rather do everything and anything to fight off imaginary boogeymen rather than creating a functional, useful currency.  They imagine in their head that they're going to come up with the most perfect solutions and it is all going to be super efficient.  They don't understand that humans aren't robots and aren't going to jump through their hoops.  They're just going to get frustrated and leave.

Fortunately many will go to BCH and Ethereum, if we don't scare them off."

Hey, I’m not disputing what you are saying, but would like to look into it a bit further. Where do you make the Bildenberg connection?  Do you have a link?
"Lightning won't work as a scaling solution.  Among other flaws with it, I wrote something recently here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bx8ao/im_asking_here_instead_of_rbitcoin_because_i_feel/dpp8b08/

Lightning isn't worthless, it can enable new use cases that don't currently exist.  But a scaling solution?  It is not."
ok i try to fix that and repost... but then i give up.  it's not that important to me to put my message there.  i am curious though, as to how they will address me after reading.
hodlers bring value for certain but what businesses will support a coin that no one can spend?  so all value is dependent on more hodlers, if hodlers leave bitcoin legacy will collapse to myspace.  mass adoption is not possible in this model.  with lightning, maybe? but again, what is it? where is it? when is it?  
"Probably because of ""BCH"" mention here and there. I guess it doesn't really matter all that much, just wanted you to see the lengths at which they go to, in order to prevent you saying your opinion. Pretty fucked isn't it?"
"Essentially the tradeoffs come between:

1. First mover advantages
2. Costs of running a fullnode
3. Cost of transaction fees.

The whole ""decentralization"" vs ""centralized"" coins is a myth.  I can go into detail if you want (but ask a specific question so I know where you're coming from).

The real key here is the first mover advantage.  Just looking at raw facts, Ethereum is: Faster; More flexible; Cheaper; More reliable; Cheaper to run; Easier and faster to sync; More decentralized in several ways.

The reason Bitcoin is bigger, more likely to be discussed, and worth more is because... Bitcoin is 6 years older than Ethereum.  Bitcoin has the Bitcoin name.  Bitcoin has had more time to get organized and more time to prove itself.

But that's fading.  A 6 year head start on a 50 year timeline is nothing.  A 6 year headstart on an 8 year timeline is huge.

Bitcoin must compete.  It doesn't have to be **better** than Ethereum, it just has to not lose first place.  If Bitcoin loses first place to Ethereum, then it **must** be better.

Now going back to the trade offs...

The cost of running a fullnode and the cost of transaction fees are intricately related as Bitcoin gets bigger and bigger.  Fundamentally transactions are bytes, and bytes cost money.  Unfortunately Core is/has taken this perspective to ridiculous levels.  A fullnode can be run for $3 a month.  I've done it, and there's lots of posts on how to do it for about that much.  The **median** transaction fee 2 days ago was $13 and the average was $19.  The two-week moving average transaction fee is $8 and median is $5.5.  It is now costing normal people twice as much to send a SINGLE transaction as it costs them to run a fullnode for an entire MONTH.

Fortunately, not everyone needs to run a fullnode.  They are not critical.  The network needs a certain minimum number to protect itself against DDOSes and sybil attacks, but we're already well beyond that point.  Beyond that, if you are transacting less than $450,000 of value, you are completely economically protected to transact trustlessly with SPV clients.  SPV clients don't download every transaction and they do scale very well, but they DO validate things and the only attacks on them are well understood and easy to defend against.

Does that answer some of your questions?"
"It isn't just that.  Bitcoin goes through huge cycles of boom and bust as it grows.  We're due for a bust cycle right now.

It always comes out of the bust cycles because someone keeps buying.  That's the difference between it and a Ponzi scheme.  It keeps growing, it recovers, and it enters the next phase of growth.

With small blocks, who will keep buying it when we land in a bust cycle?  The businesses and use-cases will all go to other cryptos because of the fees and unreliability.  They won't be buying.

Hodlers?  Hodlers are going to be attracted the next biggest thing the moment another crypto passes Bitcoin.  They're in it for the money, not for Bitcoin.  They won't keep buying.

Small blocks literally turns the greatest invention since the Computer into just another damn Ponzi scheme. :("

"
I know literally nothing about bitcoin yet I know that this is not close to the first time transaction backlog has been serious. I want to know when you say you were a die hard supporter of core, what do you mean if you didn't even know basic stuff of their work?
If you mean the 'fee event', that already happened (and un-happened, and re-happened, a couple of times).  That was basically the usage experience of the network changing from one where a low fee will get your transaction confirmed quickly, to one where even a high fee may keep your transaction delayed for a long time if not dropped entirely.  Every time blocks have been full for more than a week or so, you could call that a fee event.  
"Again, I believe relatively no one will use Lightning on the BTC or BCH network.

The entire user experience of ""paying to open channels"" and having to pre-move coins in advance to use at merchants is completely foreign to how everyone is used to using bitcoin.

We just need businesses to realize that they can do more transactions per day, at far less expense no less, with Bitcoin Cash. The more trasnsactions per day, the more fees they generate. This goes for most if not all bitcoin business, legit and illegimate (dark market). It is slowly starting to happen. Coinbase making BCH available in January will be another nail in BTC's coffin."
yes, i tried to listen to someone explain this one day but they didn't seem to know how to explain it well.  my impression is that no one knows how it will really work. this could be the reason for the delays.  but lightning sounds cool doesn't it??  zippity quick!  problem is we might all pass before it gets here. :(

I trust Szabo a lot more than fake satoshi, it's funny cuz I went opposite of you.  Started out big block, started digging and kept an open mind and ended up going with the small blockers but thats how it goes.   I have no hate for big blockers, I hate the annoying shills and trolls but both sides have that.  I don't like that BCH has like 95% hashrate from 1 guy, thats pretty centralized.  I get that it has to scale but i think its kind of used like a boogey man, kind of how politicians use it to get voters to vote for them.   But i enjoyed the substance of your post eventhough i dasagree with a lot of it, its better than a lot of what both sides have to offer. 
"How they do their moderation so efficiently is something of a mystery to me.

I speculate that they have people working in three shifts, constantly online, observing and deleting postings in real time. Assisted by computer algorithms, no doubt. Perhaps they have a team of programmers dedicated to refining their algorithms. Who knows.

I do not understand the workings of their minds, and why they so strongly resist even the thought, let alone action, of increasing the block size.

They have steadfastly refused to provide the type of open moderation logs provided by other subreddits like /r\/BTC and /r\/Cryptocurrency.

Some people liken this group to North Korea. But North Korea is technologically not stupid, and would not hesitate from using big blocks when needed.

I think they are more like the ancient Sentinelese people, isolated from civilization, speaking a language nobody else understands, hunting with spears, who out of fear and panic try to kill anybody in a fishing boat that accidentally strays onto their island."

fair enough!
"> they are loosening it up a little

The only relevant thing is, the entire camp was completely unable to act against censorship when they benefited from it. Before that happened, I thought Core was a regular dispersed open-source group.

What censors do after today cannot change what has been revealed so far.

> Big blockers also do not seem to be concerned that a bunch of huge Bitcoin companies and miners came together for a secret agreement in a room to change the code. 

I am uneasy even discussing in these terms. What next? I tell you that the CEO/civilian/President from Blockstream did this far earlier than ""big blockers""? Which is incidentally the case? Come on.

Whether you know it or not, people will make deals. We are in the know of the above because publicizing it served a purpose. Let's not become tools.

> These examples are just a few where I feel, the big blockers are supporting the kinds of views Bitcoin was created to remove. Too big to fail, a few people controlling the entire network. If we follow Jihan’s model we might as well go with the PBOC instead.

I don't get this part.

What is Jihan's model and what is Blockstream/Core doing to prevent it? As far as I can tell, they have not done a single thing to prevent chip manufacture monopolization. They have also not integrated any of the proposed solutions to prevent mining pool consolidation.

How is people telling others to not move out from Coinbase and trade on GDAX to avoid fees somehow against big business? As far as I can tell, every decentralized use case, from colored coins to crowd-funded development, is simply removed. All is left is BitPay and Coinbase, the bodies you claim they are fighting against?

I think the vision you support is very healthy, but you need to do the measurements independently instead of relying on what people claim.

"Cause bitcoin core has a bunch of weaknesses that are now being attacked. That' how these systems with so much open information work. They get more resilient by actively being attacked. Because it's all new, nobody knows about weaknesses untill they are revealed by being attacked. Then they can be fixed. But this is way beyond just code. I don't belief Bitcoin has many technical weaknesses but it does have economical and political weaknesses. 


Just think what would happen if the rumor is spreading that bitfinex is in trouble. Let's say a large enough number of people get worried about their bitcoin and start transferring their funds away. Now the mempool becomes full. People redo their transactions with a higher fee (replace by fee), still stuck! Higher fees! Miners switch back to bitcoin cause of the insane high fees. 

These are all weaknesses in the entire ecosystem that powerful players (like Roger Ver) can attack and therefor will attack. 

Bitcoin Core refuses to adapt to any other vision but their own but they don't know what vision is the right one, nobody knows. This is all unknown territory and it's more then just technical code. Bitcoin as code is just dumb code. It's people that make the code come to life by believing in it and running it. So code can't save anything when code is just manipulation of symbols that only human beings give a meaning too. 

And so the political and economical aspects of bitcoin are really important. As important as the technical code. We humans have learned about different political systems and different economical systems and econsystems. Now that old knowledge needs to used and integrated with this new technology that is quite a game changer. 

This is where things went wrong. Bitcoin rapidly became highly political and even religious and cultist in nature. 

I wonder if we will ever see something like bitcoin suicide. Cult leaders when thing go wrong convincing their followers to blow it all up. 

Bitcoin has had great tech leaders but now it needs political and economical leaders. Otherwise it's first place in crypto will be taken over by communities that are less devided and just lag a  bit behind bitcoin, look at what it is doing wrong, fix that and do it right. 

It's nice to be number two just like it's nice to be the second born son. You look at your older brother and learn from what he does wrong and then you don't have to make the same mistakes.

Bitcoin core refuses to learn. It's not teachable. It does not differentiate between making a political compromise and a technical compromise. And that is going to end up being  very costly. 

Ever since WWII we live in a world where consensus is engineered.   Just read some of Noam Chomsky his work. Or watch Adam Curtis ""Century of Self"".

Even the great hero Aaron Swartz wrote that his life changed after learning about how consensus can be engineered. 

And so words like ""centralization"" and ""consensus"" are just words being thrown around without much meaning behind what people are saying. 

There is no such thing as machine consensus. Machines don't care one way or the other. They don't struggle when you try to shut them down. Human consensus is a fickle thing because if you can influence how people think then you can influence what it is they think they want. After that consensus is not consensus  anymore, it has been bypassed and compromised. """"But the people want this!"" That's why democracy has been dead for a long time and most people stopped caring about it after learning that in the current system there vote has no power what so ever.

"I like to think that I'm a person who can admit when I was wrong and abandon a flawed viewpoint.

My story is similar to a lot of others--went looking for a bitcoin subreddit, found r/bitcoin, listened to what the community was saying.

I think in the wake of the mempool disaster there are a lot of people taking a look at BCH and r/btc for the very first time, and I was one of them.  I was challenged on a lot of my beliefs and thankfully provided with a lot of information I had never read before."
you seem to have all the talking points down.  i don't fall for conspiracies.  i see them.  and this one is becoming more clear...... developing.

"One consequence of having prevented scaling while we wait is that all the new people piling money in now have bought into a totally different vision.   They see Bitcoin as a way to get rich and increase their fiat wealth.  They buy in to the ""store of value"" concept, where it doesn't matter if you use on-chain transactions.   Blockchain is just a word, no meaning.

As I'm sure you well remember, the mantra used to be ""Once bitcoin succeeds, you won't care what the price is.   You'll only spend Bitcoin.""     I never hear anyone say that anymore.   I'd be lying if I said I didn't get excited when the fiat value of my crypto rises.   Its still a fiat world, after all.   But for me that price rise represented more than just my net worth in fiat.  It meant the chance of the dream of a Bitcoin future was that much close to a reality.   This dream has been lost to short-term minded get-rich-quick thinking."

"Moreso disagreement by a few leads to 'no consensus' leads to lack of acting.  

The analogy I like to use- we're all on a bus that's headed toward a cliff at 60mph.  Half of us say we should turn left, the other half say we should turn right, but we can't overall agree, so the bus driver says 'nope until you guys agree we're just gonna maintain status quo and nothing will change'.  
This of course ignores the fact that if we do nothing a change will happen, namely we will drive off the cliff.  

Jeff Garzik [wrote a great piece back in 2015](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html) about how lack of action causes change.  It includes the semi-famous quote ""Without exaggeration, I have never seen this much disconnect between user
wishes and dev outcomes in 20+ years of open source."" and is worth a read.

"
"> perhaps they are not even computer scientists but just look like one?

I believe that many Core developers and their toadies like Theymos genuinely thought that no one would have the audacity or even the skills to actually fork away from them. They are egotistical and haughty people who think they are the best crypto developers in the world. Then, after the fork occurred, the narrative became ""well, BCH will keep trending downward until it's worth $5, free airdropped money"". Wrong again.

They assume actual users of bitcoin will suffer congestion and high fees, just to wait for the promised land of true 2nd-layer solutions. Again, not true - people will just swap their funds into other usable cryptocurrencies  long before then.

I further believe that even if a fully operational Lightning Network + software were delivered tomorrow on the BTC network, few people would actually use it. It would see the same niche usage as SegWit, if not less. It is simply too complex compared to how people have been used to transacting in Bitcoin for the last 8+ years."

"Cryptography/software developer nerds don't necessarily understand economics.

What is important in Bitcoin is the economic incentive theory that makes it tick. Coding is simply monkey work (although important) to  execute that theory into practise.

What I'm trying to say is that there are many skilled cryptographers and coders in this world, but only few who would be able to understand economic incentives so well as to come up with something like Bitcoin.
Actually some of current Core devs originally mocked the idea and said it couldn't work.

You should always think yourself and try to understand what makes the system work. As an anarchist you should always know to question authority. Often times you lack knowledge in some field and have to trust someone who knows better, but atleast you should understand what should be known.

"Great post that I've also been through recently myself. I used to joke about and dump on BCH and me and my friends would laugh as we would short the coin on exchanges. Kinda wish I had just held on to it now but I've increased my position in BCH. Finding out that AXA had ties to block stream was what got me really skeptical. We were supposed to move away from that banks and big finance but instead our developers ended up on their payroll. 

I remember investing in a company a while back that were streaming movies and shows thinking it was going to be the next Netflix but all the while I was using Netflix because the other service just wasn't usable. Over time the company decayed and essentially closed down. I learned that if I'm not going to use it then why would someone else? BTC is starting to feel that way now. With the High fees, the backlog of unconfirmed transactions, the network speed and a scaling solution that it is almost 100% dependant on a tech that we don't even know will work on such a scale and it's not remotely close. 18 months is an estimate but it could be more. Does that mean the only thing we can do with BTC in the next 18+months is to just hold it? I was so confident BTC would hit 10k early next year but now I am not so sure.  "

I screwed up too I suppose buddy because I missed the Bitcoin boat for a very long time because i listened to peter schiff.  When my ex wife cam after my money i was forced to used bitcoin...

One of the first btc transactions I had to wait 2 days for it to go through.

I clicked pretty quick thou when i found out about it. The 1mb blocks were too small! 2 day to waits was too long.

Maybe you didn't actually use bitcoin and you just hold it. The people using bitcoin are pissed off at wait times, especially when the price is dropping fast and you wanna sell but you cant because you are waiting for confirmations.

Nice post. Glad to see other people using their brain
"I'm much more a nerd than a capitalist or anarchist, but I still think full blocks are no good.  The protocol is simply not designed for handling constantly full blocks.

One doesn't have to resort to conspiracy theories (though, my favorite conspiracy theory is that there exists some PR consultancy company working on both sides of the schism, actively doing their best to fuel the conflict and split the community).  Let's just say that there exist this ""Maxwell vision"" where the blockchain is thin and slim, with regular payments going over sidechains, lightning or similar.  With all on-chain transactions using the RBF-flag, and with smart wallet software cramming extra transactions into the existing RBF'ed unconfirmed transaction things may work out - it will be a real ""fee market"" like he wants it to be.  I must admit, it does appeal a bit to me in a nerdy way - but even if it technically is a small change (miners could always honor RBF without any changes done to the protocol, and the 1 MB hard limit has been there since the very early days), functionally it's a very big change.

Also, consider what's at stake?  The network effect is very strong, there is *no point* to have cool tech available as long as the network effect is missing.  Consider PGP (GPG), it was very cool tech back in 1991 when it was released, and although it's no longer the bleeding edge tool for encrypting and signing email, it's still the best alternative widely available - and nobody is using it!  We had our golden moment where bitcoin payments were working much more smoothly than credit card payments, we do need bitcoin payments to work better than credit card payments to reach the critical mass adoption.

I still don't believe the Bilderberg part. But the association kg BTC with big banks,  GS, JPM etc. had already made me suspicious & some posts clearly showing the AXA association hit the final nail in that coffin. I strongly believe that it has been taken over by big banks & they're running it like a Ponzi  scheme. And that's when I decided to switch to BCH. it doesn't raise as many red flags as the BTC does.

"This is one of the best posts I've read so far on bitcoin's development, direction and culture. Complemented by some very informative comments by other participants. It's posts and comments like this that make trawling Reddit a productive activity.

I've been involved with computers since the Apple IIe and DOS days. But am very new with cryptos. I'm ashamed to admit that for a few years, I had totally dismissed Bitcoin and cryptos as ""a ponzi scheme"", ""a fad"", ""bound to fail"" and such. Without even doing some basic research first. How wrong I was! And especially in the blockchain technology that is even more impactful than cryptos.

But anyway... I have been rather confused by the very nasty spat involving the bitcoin and BCH people. The Core supporters keep condemning big block, BCH supporters as ""not keeping to Satoshi's vision"" and thereby trying to seize the moral high ground. Talking as if they are the chosen ones. It's like those religious extremists who insist they are the true adherents of Prophet Muhammad or Jesus Christ, and anyone who disagree with them are enemies of God.

I believe that the world will move towards what is better when it comes to cryptos. In the sense that the winning crypto is one that adapts to the world. Not one that demands the world take the initiative. Bitcoin may be the number one right now. But it might later turn into what MySpace is - the Number One social media network...of 2008. 

As I see it, BCH stands a better chance of wider usage worldwide. The Core supporters keep underestimating the expertise of BCH's developers. If interest keeps growing, I'll bet more talented people will get involved in BCH. And with it being more responsive to real world demands, BCH will pull ahead. And be widely acknowledged as ""The Real Bitcoin"". "
Im a fucking noob and I dont get it.. Is this post pro BTC or pro BCH?
It's nerd vs socialists. The pumpers of bch are not libertarian by a long shot. If you buy unto a shitcoin you are going to be left behind. The free market has chosen the stronger network.
You know they will call you a fake convert, right? I am sure they call and maybe think these kind of posts are fake stories. Why did it become so much like a religion?
Another one year old account here to parrot the party line against Core, much surprise. Many shocked. And is apparently a flat earther, according to his comment history. Generally you shouldn't let ones views on one topic color your opinion on their views of another, as each argument should stand on their own weight. Unless one happens to be particularly ridiculous, which...yeah. Good luck with that.

Core acts like Antifa and much of the narrative is the same as Antifa. Profit and capitalism is bad, greed (in lack of a better word) is bad. I honestly don't know how the target audience for Bitcoin Core is any longer. If its supposed to become a store of value you would expect to have some vocal and knowledgeble Von Mises people at the top fronting the entire operation to give credibility to the entire concept of competing with gold.

"What a pleasant read, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, I doubt you would have been able to post thought provoking posts like this on /r/Bitcoin. 
My 2 cents on the matter: 
BTC core chose inaction at a time of uncertainly. However, that does not deprive them of the option of making future changes that will bring BTC up to speed again. 
The market cap for BTC and crypto in general is still relatively small, and thus widely open to manipulation by the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, who hold large amounts of BTC and have a mining equipment business to run, which I can only assume needs to be kept profitable. Bitmain was selling its S9 models strictly for BCC, a lot of people bought them for around 4-5 BCC a piece, and now got screwed because 2 weeks later those same people pumped the coin to where 1 BCC now buys you 1 Antminer S9. 


A lot of us try to ignore the phenomenal surge that has taken place since summer, whining that BTC is « back under 6k » , while just a few months everyone was amazed it reached 3k. 
Crypto may be worlds apart from Fiat, but the human factor of quickly getting used to abnormal profits and artificially creating circumstances to repeat such scenarios is identical..

"
I lolled so hard at the fake satoshi line. Welcome to the rabbit hole bitcoin brother. You echo many of my thoughts in that post.
Yikes bilderberg strikes again
"Just a few things though:

1) The core devs never agreed to the NY agreement, but they did fail the HK agreement. The devs were left out of it, after they failed their first agreement.

2) Clearly the core devs hate capitalists, but fear of them is a healthy thing. How do you know these first batch of companies won't become centralized evil they sought to destroy, what if you are looking at Netscape before Chrome, sure Netscape advanced internet browsing immeasurably, but that does not mean the creators should obtain mythical ""supreme leader"" like worship. 

I do think Roger Ver has been unfairly treated, and has been character assasinated.

3) The common argument I see thrown around is that lots of miners love Bitcoin and want a blocksize increase, that is incorrect, a FEW miners own the entire mining network in China, that was never part of the plan. When one guy like Jihan can singlehandedly dictate the consensus, that is wrong. There are thus about 5-7 miners vs the consensus of tens of thousands of users and devs.

**4) This reddit and the Bitcoin Cash side should STOP hanging out and endorsing with Craig Wright (A fraud that stole taxpayers money from Australia), as he is one of the primary reasons core supporters think Bitcoin Cash is backed by illegitimate people.**

5) The argument you are looking at is purely ideological, the core argument is that Bitcoin is a store of value more than it is currency, current prices and mainstream internet suggests so. Core supporters are betting on L2 technologies like Lightning. Whether Bitcoin is a store of value AND a currency, isn't settled. Do you pay people with gold or your house? At some point gold was used as a currency, but then it quickly became a ""store of value"" in history. 

As much as people hate it, but there is at least a POSSIBILITY of Bitcoin being worth so much, because it's hugely illiquid (high fees, slow transaction).

6) Having two versions of Bitcoin is GOOD, you can choose who to align with, this is not a zero sum game in my opinion, besides so much infrastructure is built on the original Bitcoin, it will take time for Bitcoin Cash to catch up. Should L2 for Bitcoin Core fail to materialize, we have a 8mb fix already in action.

7) Blockstream's influence on core code is debatable, but core's teams lack of empathy is a universally agreed problem. The Segwit2x showed their lack of political ability to compromise."

"I see a ""nerd"" theme in this post - and just want to point out that if you're not a ""nerd"" of the relevant kind yourself, then you can't really identify the ""real nerds"" in an information war.

Greg Maxwell is an interesting case. Clever guy for sure. I myself am not a ""crypto-nerd"", more of a ""sysadmin-nerd"" or ""embedded-dev-nerd"", so there is a lot of overlap. I saw a few comments from gmaxwell that were really condescending - which does not make them wrong, I can be condescending at times when I really feel like it - but they were not 100% factually correct, and that rubbed me the wrong way.

Clearly, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik are also nerds. I'd say Greg Maxwell is a kind of nerd, but in a less pure way, with more ego-driven motivations than purely technical.

There's also a lot of non-technical fanboys on both sides, which always muddies the waters - you can always criticize the other sides fanboys and it's not really a ""strawman"" but it also isn't really countering the best arguments of the other side. And this again is something Greg would do, while e.g. Gavin and Jeff did not.

I'm still unlearning and relearning everything I believed and thought I knew about blocksizes, but at the end of the day what mattered most to me was when I finally took a look at BCH and realized that big blocks actually worked to keep money moving even during a deficiency of hashrate.

Even right from the start. It's definitely repetitive, but sometimes you have to repeat yourself to be heard with new users entering every day.

I bought my first coins around 2012-2013. Before creating my account, I was a Reddit lurker for years. I only started to get involved in the conversation when I saw the compromise and cooperation going south on BitcoinCore's team when Gavin was lead developer but stepping down. I knew something was wrong. It just felt bad in my gut what some of these new developers like Greg Maxwell seemed more interested in the prestige of being Bitcoin's top developer than actually fostering Bitcoin's growth. They were fighting against what the original developers like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and others were proposing as good, sound ideas for scaling. Greg was seeking power and control whereas Gavin was stepping down selflessly to spend time with his family. I just saw two different motives and knew immediately that one was dishonest and immature.

Since I've started I've always been true to my gut. Like you, I believed in Bitcoin even before the 2013 ramp up and Mt. Gox crash. I was buying at $100, $500, $1000, then when the crash happened, I continued to buy and hold. Sometimes you imagine a possible future that others aren't able to see. I've been lucky enough to have been gifted some of that sight and it has been painful watching people trying to destroy Bitcoin, not from outside, but from within it's own development team. 

I've seen BitcoinCore go from a respectable group of veteran developers into an immature, censorship-driven insular group with just one or two people in control. They disseminate messages from the top down and those messages are then filtered throughout r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org, bitcointalk and, all of the sudden now, a bunch of twitter and social media trolls which I assume are paid astroturfing campaigns. This change happened exactly around the time when Blockstream was founded and became involved. Greg Maxwell, Blockstream's CTO has openly admitted to being BitcoinCore's code gatekeeper. New developers, new ideas, are not welcome. The power-hungry seeker got his position of power and now he has an army of social media manipulators working to keep him there. They criticize anyone that goes against what Greg says, no matter who it is or what they've done for Bitcoin in the past. They have no respect for Satoshi's original vision or the hard work that was put in for years before they even knew about Bitcoin.

In many ways I was lucky to be here and see this unfold before the heavy censorship started. Us that have been here witnessed how people were silenced just for speaking their minds. Control got tighter and tighter until literally saying anything at all they disagree with, even if it is within the moderation rules, will get you banned at r/bitcoin. Bitcoin was supposed to be about financial freedom, but for some reason they don't think people should discuss it freely? 

This is an attack. BitcoinCore has been taken over by attackers, trying to destroy the technology that many thought they were responsible for fostering. Along that path, they've blamed everyone and everything except themselves and the deliberately Bitcoin-crippling decisions they've made. At first I thought it was accidental negligence, but then it became so deliberate and anti-common sense that I knew it was being driven by some other force.

That's why we're here. Bitcoin Cash is a branch without Segwit that aims to keep Bitcoin's original vision: peer to peer electronic cash for everyone. Not just the rich, no middle-men bankers and no governmental inflation/control. It's for the people. It is an idea that cannot be stopped.

Thank you for your story and welcome."
Awesome, great to read.  Also great to have someone who sees the vision behind this, not just the money.
Good. You decided to take the red pill and not be arrogant like most people are. Keep it up, we need more people to know the truth!
Which core developers agreed to the NYA and then backed out?  I don't follow what you are saying about that.
Great story on the evolution of bitcoin. I don’t know if you noticed, but after saying you weren’t going to do it, you just divided up the camps into a right and wrong side and maneuvered yourself onto the right side.
Great write up. I wish I had your energy! 
You know, ive used bitcoin quite a bit, but kinda fell out of the loop when bch started. Ive had a hard time catching up through all the shitposting, but this really lined it up well for me. Thanks for the post
"I feel like this post marks a turning point. Sincere people are waking up from a long slumber.

We need a ready list of general resources for open-minded Core supporters to read that explains the key issues in clear and fair terms. A collection of the best posts and comments on blocksize, market governance, Segwit, LN, mining incentives, SPV scaling, the economics of competition in money (you can't just leave all the commerce to altcoins and hope to stay the No. 1 store of value), network topology and the history of the ""full node"" idea, the insidious effects of censorship bubble, the statistical utility of zero-confirmation transactions, etc. "
Fuck this was amazing.  You literally described my experience to the fucking T. 
Welcome back to Bitcoin (Cash).
"/u/tippr $1

BCH is anarchy in the making!"
The reason why i didn't even bother understanding BCH was god damn BTC's fees. It would take 0.005 BTC to send bittrex my money. 0.005=3$ and dollar is 3.8X worth of my currency so it would look a lot to me. So I didn't even bother learning BCH for a long time. Recently i said f*ck this.I'll reserach and  got in in bittrex. I bought at 800$ sold at 1900$.  and I'll invest in BCH again after it builds a support.

Welcome fellow nerd. There's a fair bit of groupthink over here as well, but posts like this help change that. 
Yep dude,  Doesn't matter what side you are on, just think for yourself vote for you wallet on the path that makes the most sense to you, not to whoever tells you they know what they are doing.  They don't.  This is new groundbreaking trail.  I don't care who is on the side of what war, but I know there is no way that having to constantly block progresses and raise fees makes for a better network or coin.

"Excellent read

1500 bits u/tippr"
Welcome.  Your opinion is valid here. 
"> Why did you so quickly renege on the NY agreement once you got what you wanted; segwit. Only dishonest pussies do that kind of thing.

They didn't renege on the agreement because they never signed it! They weren't there, no one asked them for their opinion, and from the beginning they were saying they don't agree to it. They didn't abandon any agreement, they just didn't surrender and agree to something they resisted from the beginning.

It was more like this:

- Core: let's activate Segwit
- miners: no, let's increase block size
- Core: no, let's activate Segwit
- 2x: let's compromise, we'll do both
- miners: ok
- Core: no
- 2x: ok, agreement signed, activating segwit and then block size
- Core: we don't agree to increasing block size
- 2x: segwit activated. block size increase in 3 months
- Core: we still don't agree
- 2x: ok, increasing block size... what's the problem, we've all agreed to it, now you're backing out?
- Core: ?!

Nothing technical about bitcoin cash and how to scale it.. I have seen these stories over and over. We need specs on how it handles scaling, not shills. I want BCH to succeed but not like this again. I wont sell but still, if it dies like this good riddance.

nah..   you lost me at Jeff Berwick... the dude is a total anarchist who sticks coffee enemas up his ass...  
good points!
"This addresses near zero of the technical aspects involved to predicate any reasoning on.

This really lacks substance."
I use bitcoin here and there. Several months ago one transaction took 5 days to confirm with normal fee. This is when my eyebrow began to rise. Of course still no solution. Market is speaking. 
Ahh the Hegelian dialectic. I’m embarrassed to not have thought of that. Very possible of course. Some elements here of that. 
personally i don't think that the 'lightbearers' of truth in bitcoin should have a parent CEO.  especially one tied to the financial industry.  maybe i'm paranoid.
"Good point that clears that up there's no connection there or revolving door and the money that changed hands now gets reversed. 

That's good I was wrong to think they ever got involved. "

"I agree that having two competing versions is good. Although, you did not mention rampant censorship, denial of service and social attacks, etc. which can help the competition fail regardless of merit. A few points, though.

No matter of how Bitcoin 'behaves', some think it *should be* a currency.  This is a completely separate discussion.  We came in to Bitcoin when it had practically zero value, in order to help solve the world's problems.  Even if I was convinced that it would make me even richer, I don't see it as a reason to abandon that goal.

I used to see the hodlers as an eternal-September-like peculiarity that are not resourceful enough to cause an imbalance, but the current Core groupthink seized it as an opportunity to ossify control and rest is history.

Second, we can't know what Bitcoin's *nature* is, if it is not allowed to be different things.  Currently, there are no technical reasons to limit the block size to 1MB, so what has been done is forcing Bitcoin to become one thing, while at the same time propagandizing some scaling rhetoric (with no scientific basis) that discourages alternative opinions in alternative projects.  Which makes overcoming the barriers even more difficult.

> Do you pay people with gold or your house?

I never did but saw it happen.  Gold is used for commerce much more than what first-worlders think.  It was used even more, but nowadays laws are emerging everywhere against paying off-bank for real estate (or anything with a high value in some places).  Same problem with above.  If it is prevented, how do you make claims about the individual/isolated nature of something?
"
1. ok  2. how do we know the sun will come up tomorrow? and I have a feeling RV will be redeemed. 3. more miners and pools online all the time. Bitmain not the only pool in favor of bch in case you haven't noticed.  4. this puzzles me too.  shit or get off the pot CW.  lots of pot sitting and no turd.  5.  if store of value is what world wants and needs then btc can become that.  is in fact becoming only that quickly.  institutional money may make it reserve currency still, but this is unlikely.  6. true  7.  well said. 
"There is no Core. 

Bitcoin has no Core authority. 

You don't need permission to write code.

It's a problem that you need their permission to increase the transaction limit. 

Going into the meeting Segwit was more controversial than the 2X hard fork.

It was agreed the more controversial change should go first because it may be abandoned if the native capacity increase happened first. "
You must have made a judgment to come to that conclusion.

I feel bad for anyone who bought a legacy coin these last few motnhs, but having bitcoin working worldwide is worth it for their loss of not doing more research before the invested
yah i was all in for the donald but then woke up.  i did make 20k worth of bitcoin by betting on him so i'm still thankful for him for that!  we all live and learn. 
Great personal analogy!  I feel the same.  
you sent me 1 cent?  lol  should i be insulted by this?
r/bitcoin ? the home of 6500!!!!   7,200!!!  7,500!!!!  7,600!!! and endless memes about Jihan Wu and Roger Ver and fake Satoshi?  zzzzz zzzzz  zzzzzz
it is better to have skin in both chains, to hedge your bets. Im a little more leaned towards bch but I don't think i could forgive myself if btc ended up dominating and i missed out. Don't forget the core devs could still increase blocks at the 11th hour. realistically though i hope everyone switches and leaves the btc chain to rot.

Why would anyone use BCH for payments when ETH = <1% the fee.
"The problem is that miners now are getting additional profits from ""Tx Acceleration Services"" that tend to overcharge their customers by large margin"
i get it. so miners must believe that faster blocks help with greater adoption which ultimately feeds into their bottom line.  nothing wrong with that in my book.

"I don’t buy it. Whenever I see a post like this it makes me wonder whether OP was ever really a small-blocker Core fanboy, or if they are just painting a picture that they know “this side” will love.

When I got to the part about the angry nerds reneging on the NYA after SegWit activated that clinched it for me. The angry nerds never *ever* supported the NYA. The four horsemen of the Corepocalypse were all over social media hours after the NYA came out denouncing it and the people who wrote/signed it. 

The idea that they were going to “back-out” after SegWit activated was it’s own piece of propaganda created by some dishonest users on this sub, not the other one. So I have to conclude that OP’s well written tale is largely fiction."

free people hate bullshit and core is starting to stink really bad.  9 years and 1mb blocks and nothing yet built on top but a theory.  it's fishy.  i will follow the smart money.  
Who fucking cares?  There are two coins now. I wish everyone would just man up and get over it. BCH is BCH. BTC is BTC. Great. Move on. We don't care about anyone's life story. Unless you are out there really doing something to change people's lives. And if you are in a reddit channel, odds are you aren't doing that.

Yes true.
"Look, you got your fork with Bitcoin cash, and yet it's clear that the economic majority has still decided it prefers the legacy chain. I highly doubt this 100 billion is market cap that has stayed with the legacy chain is just all blockstream.

If there were only a few core devs who didn't want the change then somebody would have proposed a patch that the rest of the industry could have adopted it regardless. Yet we don't see that happening. Could that be because there is actually lack of consensus across far more system actors then just a few blockstream devs? Could it be that core devs cannot force a change that they know entire industry doesnt fully support and will result in a chain split? Food for thought."

"You mean 2011 (six years ago) back when it was only known by a handfull of people and no one knew what to do with the coins? 

As far as most people concerned it just looled like a scam. Now most people in developed countries have heared about bitcoin and I would say we're in early mainstream adoption.. Good money can still be made but nowhere near the 1000 fold that has been since 2009-2011

"Ok? I realize that there are market forces at work that are beyond anyone’s comprehension. Nothing you said contradicts the reason I gave, though.

If people started using bitcoin more, the mempool would fill up, fees would skyrocket, and bitcoin would become unusable. The only force that could keep bitcoin afloat then would be sheer ignorance.

No one would buy bitcoin for the privilege of paying a $1000 transaction fee. If the price didn’t crash, then we would know for certain that bitcoin is a speculative bubble which will eventually pop."
yes well as an /r/btc subscriber you aren't an average joe or his mom 
Talent and perception should be awarded :)
... I agree that the get-rich culture is fundamentally delusional, annoying, and toxic, but in fairness, the first $50 of btc i bought would have been enough today for any production lambo, if it weren't for that little mtgox thing.. and anyone who put 10k in 1 year ago could buy a lambo today. If current trends continue for 2.2 more years, a $50 lambo for that person is still in the cards.

"Did not know that. Once I got bit by the bitcoin bug I realized that there would be many flavors and I kept an open mind right from the start.

Unless there's some way to prove a code has no bugs, there has to be some way to fix them without people losing tons of money imo.

"The only reason it’s still number one is because usage has been stagnant enough to hide the fact that they have a minuscule transaction capacity.

Of course, that’s no guarantee that the bubble won’t hold. The investors driving the price up seem to have little interest in actually using the damn thing."

Same as Crypto mass adoption will not happen over night, we need to push it and keep the pace. Improve network capacity on chain and off chain at fastest rate possible (S2X). Bitcoin is currently stuck with 1Mb and low segwit adoption.

u/tippr tip .0003 BCH
BWAHAHAHAHA.
"Hi Crispyanit,

Be careful as you buy and sell small amounts these days because fees are high. https://bitcoinfees.info

Don't know when you were doing those transactions, but this problem really escalated in last couple of days. Bitcoin to be useful as a currency should be settled in couple minutes and fees should be under $0.20.  Currently fees are $5-$10-$15 and you could be waiting for days for you transaction to settle.

Yes, bitcoin cash is instant. However BCH have much lower brand recognition. I don't know what will happen in future in terms of their value. My best advice for you is to buy both.

Good luck."

The trader dismounted from his camel and drew near, offering his canteen, the fluids jostling inside.

The crawling man struggled to kneel, and said with a dry and slow voice ""Do... you... take... bitcoin?"" 

The Berber tradesman motioned for him to take the water, but the thirsting man drew a ""B"" in the sand.

He pulled out his cellphone and loaded up the BitcoinCore web wallet: ""Do you... Bitcoin? Buy water?"" But the trader seemed not to understand.

The Berber man thrust the canteen into the dying man's hand and motioned for him to drink.

The dying man looked at the canteen and thought how amazing just a single drink would be right now. ""Please... may I buy some water?""

The Berber man nodded, smiled, and motioned for him to drink.

no prob. some ppl are sensitive to the names used because this sub gets a lot of attacks from paid trolls. ultimately you choice, ofc.
Okay. So where does it end? People keep forking the bitcoin protocol and altering it to make it more favourable for the miners in order to steal market share away from the other chains. Are users just supposed to chase the miners from forked coin to forked coin to whatever chain is most favourable for the miners??? The users have to make a stance at some point and say NO to all these forks eventually. Otherwise it just leads to the miners having full control of how to manipulate the protocol however they want, in order to make things most favourable for them, the small number of big business miners. Let's not pretend the miners that set up in their living rooms are even part of the equation anymore
"If all the miners leave there won't be a network.

If ENOUGH miners leave the network will be so slow and expensive......it will drag BTC down with it.

HODL doesn't work if too many miners leave.

The has rate Exodus hasn't slowed down and the fact that bitcash is more profitable and more liquid with much lower fees means the Exodus won't stop either.

This actually might be the beginning of the end for BTC."
Thanks, I will look into it. 
Correct
Then leave. Your comment history shows you are trolling & concern trolling in r/btc.
That's the problem with this whole POW system. Miners have all the power, and they'll keep changing the protocol over and over again to make themselves the most profit. Decentralization goes out the window. If BCH takes over, it will be BCH now, until the next fork comes along, and then the next one, and then the next one. Until users lose all faith in Bitcoin because there is no decentralization. Very un-satoshi.

And that's fucked up. BTC will only ever be as good as its communities and the evolution from the people around it. I agree the fees are shit and the only ones mining are mega farms making it prohibitive and isolating the control of new coins to a select few.

Potential losses. Say you made the decision to sell at $7000, so you sent it to an exchange but it finally arrives when the price is 6500. Then you sell, and you lost out on 500$
I mean it is true that bitcoin cash is superior to bitcoin in terms of speed and usability . but it is inferior to other coins by the same metrics. So relatively speaking, bch is slow and has high fees too compared to other coins

">Bitcoin Core with it's whopping 3 transactions a second. Bitcoin Cash with it's whopping 24 transactions a second.

The 8MB limit on BCH is just the current default setting for various clients.  The limit doesn't really matter provided it's kept comfortably above the current market equilibrium block size so as not to act as a binding economic constraint. (This was how the 1-MB limit functioned on the BTC chain for the first six or so years of its existence.)  No one who supports Cash is fetishizing 8-MB as some kind of sacred and ""immutable"" ""consensus rule"" that defines the one true Bitcoin Cash chain.  

>Visa with it's whopping 24,000 transactions a second. Why are we even trying to compete for this market?

You mean the market for money? Because we recognize that an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a direct attack on Bitcoin's money property and basic value proposition.  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6emrtd/three_ways_an_arbitrary_capacity_limit_harms/

>Wouldn't you rather bitcoin stay decentralized? 

Yes, and that's why increasing its capacity to accommodate continued growth is so important.  Failing to do so will force more and more users off the blockchain and onto inherently riskier and more centralized ""off-chain"" solutions.  

>So I would take it to understand, that you would or do not host your own wallet or node. So you're probably going to want someone to do that for you...You know...A trusted 3rd party. 

No. The average user has absolutely ZERO need to run a so-called ""full node.""   An SPV client can allow you to verify that the transactions that you care about have been included in a block with valid PoW and grow increasingly confident that this block has been accepted by the network as a whole as you watch it get buried ever deeper under more blocks with valid PoW while remaining the longest chain. SPV doesn't imply *less* security / confidence in the transactions you care about; it simply takes *a bit more time* to achieve a given level of confidence in a particular transaction of interest. (And that difference is extremely tiny, if not essentially theoretical, given how incredibly unlikely it is that you'll encounter an invalid block with valid PoW.)

The only assumption you make when you rely on SPV security is that the mining majority won't accept ""invalid"" blocks.  But Bitcoin's security model has *always* been explicitly premised on the assumption that the mining majority would be incentivized to be ""honest"" and protect the integrity of the network. Moreover, a malicious hash rate majority doesn't *need* to produce ""invalid"" blocks to defraud users or otherwise completely undermine the network's integrity."
8 Mb is the block size limit and not actual size, so there's no more bloat than with Core's blocks, as long as Segwit isn't widely used, which it seems will never happen.
Moore's law dictates that processors become more efficient all the time.
I'm interested to know why you'd choose something less reliable and more expensive to transact with.
"Ideas:

1) Change ""send warm wishes 24/7"" to something that reflects the poor usability in sending transactions, maybe something about the backlog?

2) Change ""for pickup anywhere"" to something that relates that you can't pick it up until it comes through the backlog.

3) Use new colors and christmas related art to distinguish it better from the other options."

">LTC moves coins better that bch and BTC . For some reason it's not popular as BTC. Why would bch take over?

I don't see how LTC moves coins any better than BCH. And the answer to your question is the network effect which is (almost) everything when it comes to money. Because Bitcoin Cash preserved the Bitcoin ledger as of the forking point, it has a much wider and healthier distribution than Litecoin. Indeed, the naive view (which I've seen some people advocate) is that Bitcoin Cash has the exact same network effect as BTC. That's obviously overstating things because the network effect isn't solely about coin distribution.  Bitcoin Cash was created as a minority hash rate spinoff that forfeited the standalone ""Bitcoin"" brand and made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm.  It has less exchange and ecosystem support, lower name recognition, and a market cap that's still substantially smaller than BTC's, all of which give BTC a strong advantage. The one significant advantage Bitcoin Cash has over BTC is that the former is not currently hobbling itself with an absurdly-inadequate capacity limit.  BCH's network effect advantage over alt-coins like Litecoin, however, is significant (and clearly reflected by the market's current relative valuation of those two coins).  If the Bitcoin main chain does commit suicide through continued mismanagement of scaling, it's much more likely that the market will converge on a ledger-preserving Bitcoin spinoff like BCH as opposed to converging on a true ""alt-coin"" like LTC."

"Bitcoin Core with it's whopping 3 transactions a second. Bitcoin Cash with it's whopping 24 transactions a second. Visa with it's whopping 24,000 transactions a second. Why are we even trying to compete for this market? Wouldn't you rather bitcoin stay decentralized? Ever sync your own wallet? 8 MB block sizes add to blockchain bloat don't they?

So I would take it to understand, that you would or do not host your own wallet or node. So you're probably going to want someone to do that for you...You know...A trusted 3rd party. Yeah dude. Why not just use Visa. It's a lot safer and they process over 1000x the transaction volume of Bitcoin Cash. Or you could just short bitcoin. That works out great for a lot of people."
"I think this would be better if it was more objective.

""SegWit coin"" should be ""Bitcoin"" (general public has no clue  what SegWit is) and the Bank part should be removed. (let's not imply something we don't know for sure). Bitcoin Cash can and will win simply by being better. We don't need to do low punches or use double talk, that's for losers.

Informing people that Bitcoin Cash is cheaper to use and faster than Bitcoin is enough. (Advertisement that is perceived as honest is more effective.)"

We don't trust Roger Ver. If btrash gets same amount of transactions it faces the same problems as the real bitcoin...

What a joke. Bitcoin Cash can never sustain low transactions fees over the long hall. Electricity and processing power inherently costs money, it's the nature of the law.
"It's no conspiracy theory: it's written in OP email, it has been confirmed multiple times by Blockstream, it's how LN is supposed to work, even you said this by talking about ""second fee market"". Blockstream *will* steal miners' fees putting them in hubs/banks' pockets if LN ever gets released, that's a known fact. Luckily it's the typical dev team that stalls indefinitely and does not deliver. Unlickily if Bitcoin continues to stall it will lose its market dominance.

And no, we don't like a ""second market"" competition, not only because is an additional vector for centralization but also because we know that every 4 years Bitcoin's security is more and more dependant on miners' fee market and stealing from that is pure suicide in the long-term."
"While I *did* remember wrong about the whitepaper, there's still no yellowpaper, no API, no GUI (and no, command line isn't a gui), implementation-specific issues, no proof it will work as intended, no real test network to try it, no real ETA other than the perpetual ""18 months from the last time an ETA was asked"".

Give it up."
"Any evidence of miners spamming txs? Or is this just the U part of FUD?  

And there's no incentive as theres a huge opportunity cost - if they were mining their own txs they would lose out on tx fees."
Core doesn't control anything, core follow principles and values that resonate with many, monetary freedom and security are above short term gains and merchant adoption, bitcoin is not here to be Paypal 2.0, we have bigger mission to accomplish. don't let the noise mislead you.
"> bitcoin shall not be controlled by one party or group

Exactly. That's why multiple groups are fighting Core right now."
"BCH is going to do very well but there is a lot of work ahead. 

Bitcoin Core is still carrying the BTC ticker which is propped up by ETFs and futures markets with investors that have no idea who Blockstream or Core are. 

3 years ago, BTC would be on a death spiral, today, there's a lot of uneducated money in it."
Another #BitcoinCash success.
"Thats the strong form of the ""consensus is not possible"" hypothesis. Most people are easily convinced by the weak form ..."
Yet every democracy is still functional to some level dispite a lack of 100% agreement in every matter.

ahahah, give me BCH.
"Harming open discussion (if anything) would improve chances of consensus, as you would not allow any discussion of alternatives. 

Why are you on about nuclear options, and victory and defeat? It's not a war?! Both chains will survive. The only question is whether BCH will ever achieve most accumulated difficulty, and be seen as the true bitcoin. My guess is that it won't. If it were going to, it would have already, especially given the SW2X shit show. "
"You are correct. I don't even know what that is.

I am assuming that the ""equilibrium"" you are talking about is the ""balance"" I was talking about. Basically the chains will maintain near the same profitability."

Compare transactions per day between two chains. Miners also secure network. Bitcoin can't work without miners. [Listening nodes](https://www.np.com/r/btc/comments/7cilg7/listening_nodes/) don't matter
That is correct. BTC and BCH are identical in all respects, except block size (BCH is larger), and segwit+RBF (BCH does not have), and now the difficulty adjustment (BCH adjusts every block).

"What about all the infrastructure built around BTC already?
 
All exchange pairs trade using BTC.If like Bitcoin maximalists at r/bitcoin, people at r/bch also believe that everything else is shit and the exchange pairs don't matter, then that'll be short-sightedness. Short-sightedness is something that BCH can't be blamed for..

Even if we ignore the trading pairs, what about the strong linkage between fiat and BTC? This is going to be important to keep investors there.

What about all the merchants that accept BTC?

So basically, BCH has to find a way to raise this infrastructure through growth of user-base or have a plan for the BTC ticker.

Or it could simply do it own thing and stick to its original gameplan of becoming the ""usable currency"" rather than the shitshow that the hodl war-cries have made BTC..

Did you actually get fined? I'm really sorry I was just kidding. I would rather you keep your money than give me gold. I don't really care for it.
"That's true.

I view it this way: there's 3 groups of miners.

  * hashrate that always mines BTC (probably around 40%)
  * hashrate that always mines BCH (probably around 10%)
  * hashrate that always mines the most profitable coin (probably around 50%) 

That means when price is between 0.1 and 0.6 BTC/BCH, the hashrate will allocate according to this price (between 10% and 60% on BCH). Outside that range, miners mine ""at a loss"" for idealistic reasons.

(I say hashrate to model miners that allocate resources based on price or similar schemes)

Also: I worded my assumption not very well. What I meant to say was that the difficulty adjusting upwards quickly will stop a massive influx of ""too many"" miners (turbo blocks).

"> bitcoin cash difficulty was set arbitrarily low

It wasn't ""set"". It's controlled by an algorithm. That algorithm was a bit ""trigger-happy"" and it only allowed quick drops, not quick rises in difficulty. That flaw was fixed with the new DAA, which seems to perform much better so far.

What's your problem with things being ""arbitrary"" anyway? The 21 million coin limit is arbitrary, too."
Was it set or just horrifically high for a start until the EDA kicked in? ( I can't remember)
Wrong. Why? Price discovery, velocities on both chains and fee dynamic, respective speeds of block generation - all contributes to miners' decision. The best indicator today is [DARIs](http://fork.lol). There's no same profitability long-term as u see, Bitcoin Segwit chain can't survive in current form

"
[deleted]
Watch DARIs closely. Each time Bitcoin Cash ends a little more profitable to mine. Not while price is falling, obviously
If BCH doesn't become the main chain, even after the whole SegWit2X shit show, I am afraid that it never will. 
The equilibrium now is 10 min block time on cash, and the same mining profitability on the two chains.
I can't realistically see a scenario that BCH would take over the BTC ticker. That's not a requirement for it to become the dominant coin though. There's nothing stopping the same investment vehicles from adopting BCH they way they have adopted BTC. In fact, it will be easier because it's already been done and the framework is already in place. 
"if you want to follow the chain then it is mandatory if it is a hard fork - otherwise if people don't want to adopt the change they are doing a network split.

I am not saying that it *is* mandatory...I am saying that the *intention* is for it to be a mandatory upgrade - people are free to upgrade.

Clearly, with the DAA adjustment hardfork the intention was and is for this to be a mandatory update - ie if you don't follow it you will be on a dead end - sure, if some person decided they wanted to preserve the existing DAA they could try to grow the minority branch - and make a network split.

A mandatory upgrade means it is not optional just to sit back and do nothing and assume you are going to be following the same chain.  A hardfork is *either* a mandatory upgrade *or* a network split.

Maybe there is a better term."
"Ah I forgot about that.

I wonder if anyone is talking about merge mining btc and BCH... "
Thanks. BCH is an obvious improvement over BTC. I think it will take a long time, but it should see the same success that BTC had.
"Why it matter to be first or second?

What matters to me is to go off bank, the rest is noise."
The x2 shit show wasn't really a big deal. It was core's last chance to scale and they refused. The real big deal is that BCH works cheaply and safely whereas Bitcoin 1MB isn't usable. Usage drives stable value but usage takes time.
"Apparently you're not aware of [$GBTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GBTC/) which is known as the ""Bitcoin Investment Trust"" who holds something like 180,000 BTC and trades on front line stock markets. "
"I just did some fooling around with block times to predict when we are going to see a difficulty increase on the BCH blockchain (to get to ~10min blocks). At the moment, the 144 block average is skewed by a few very long blocks, it is very likely the difficulty will increase around block #504162 if nothing crazy happens (like much more mining power and much faster blocks).

This would put the difficulty adjustment to kick in in about ~~70-90 minutes~~ 6-8 hours (maybe I should go to sleep, but the rest if the math checks out) as of now, it will then oscillate a little (shoot up too high, go down again), but in a few hours this should be sorted out.

Data: http://bch.xbt.it/ assumption for prediction is 5 minute block time (as is the average block time since the hardfork)"
Yes, you are probably correct in this. 
"I agree, what's going to cause the drift is miners who want big blocks dumping BTC when it's more profitable.  That and so long as BTC is substantially higher a much smaller share of it's coins need to be traded into BCH in order to drive the price up than the other way around.  Given they have nearly identical supply and distribution still I think that's meaningful.

That's taking out all other factors and looking only at mining.  The real fight here the BCH low fee advantage vs the BTC network effect.  On a long enough time frame I don't see how BCH can loose.  The question is will there be any kind of usable scaling solution for BTC in time to prevent that."
The Christians say that Jesus died as a sacrifice to atone for our sins.  Who was he sacrificed to?  His Father.  Assuming Jesus really felt pain and death on the Cross, he has a fucked up dad that allows his son to be tortured and die, even if it was only temporary.
"But some software releases are done as softforks that may not require implementation in order to still validly follow the chain.  So we need a term that people understand that if they wish to keep following the chain and validating it fully they must do the upgrade.  Perhaps a ""consensus upgrade"" instead of ""mandatory upgrade"". "

The better terms are software release, network upgrade (if software was installed by majority) and chain split (if occurred)

Basically as the Bitcoin Cash price goes up, the Bitcoin SegWit price will go down, and hash power will leave Bitcoin SegWit until Bitcoin SegWit isn't adjusting difficulty down fast enough and the death spiral will likely begin."
Well you can't get higher than infinity.

"> Having a bunch of people loudly tweeting and getting reddit upvotes means nothing.

That's not *entirely* correct. I think you're missing an important mechanism: miners want to enforce rules in such a way that it helps market price (they are profit-driven). So they *do* look at what ""the people"" want. Now, wether they fall for propaganda and make-belief about public opinion is another matter, but they certainly *do* take ""the market"" into consideration when making decisions about where to put their hashrate.

This doesn't make it ""a democracy"", but it certainly puts some power into the hands of the people, who can definitely ""vote with their wallets"" and influence where hashrate goes.

This can be seen very clearly now (with the new DAA): the price almost ""dictates"" which chain hashrate chooses (within limits), because a lot of miners (driven purely by profit-motive) just switch to the most profitable chain.

"you are right, what I meant is it is going to take some time for the difficulty to actually change (as it did, the first block that started to raise the difficulty in a significant way to reducde block time was #504163, so I was not that far away with my ""prediction"")"

That's really nice of you man! You're doing gods work :)
Miner exploit everything that can't crash the system. Miners are unable to sustain chain split even if they want to also
No because as they leave BCH would receive more hashpower and adjust difficulty upwards and miners would switch to BTC. No need for BTC adjustment because BCH now adjusts faster so it will be basically pegged to the price.

"Under the git source code management system, each developer works on his own branch which are constantly merged with other developers. A fork is when disagreement occurs, and two parts on the team continues with their own version. The fork language comes from that system, and maybe from free software development in general. Originally, I think, it comes from the unix ""fork"" syscall, where the program copies itself in memory and continues as two programs, their states diverge from the fork point on. So we really had no fork.

"So-called ""layer two solutions"" aren't ""scaling""; they're *banking*. The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it. (Consider, for example, [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)) There's nothing inherently *wrong* with ""layers."" There will always be a natural balance between money proper (on-chain transactions) and various money substitutes (things like the proposed LN or even just simple fully-custodial banking models).

The hashrate is proportion to the energy bill.  Given the same block time and block reward, assuming the same block fee (in term of coin) and the same efficiency mining devices, therefore the hashrate ratio is also energy bill ratio for 1.0 coin.  Should the market price differs from the 1.0 coin energy bill too much, they will converge by the force of energy arbitrage.  Hence hashrate ratio will be very close to price ratio.

They are dangerous. Chain splits are literally community dividers. Had the community managed to find consensus BTC's value would be todays BTC+BCH. Everybody would be winning.
What is your belief, that bcc/bch becomes the main bitcoin?
Let's face it it's not like BCH is the first coin to hard fork. Altcoins do it all the time. We've had ample proof that hard forks can indeed be safe and that when they have consensus they go over rather smoothly. 
"I'm not talking about what I want or don't want. I'm talking about what will happen when BCH price increases.

A positive feedback loop of increasing BCH price / decreasing BTC price causing miners to move over to BCH (because it will be more profitable). BTC will never be able to readjust it's block difficulty because the update happens based on number of blocks (every 2016 blocks)"
Right but it sounds more dramatic that way. 
Get mad at me if you want but to be fair BCH has a quite a small and tight community so forking is easier. Hard forking BTC would be a bit more risky due to the scale of it and the diversity of the participants.
Actual usage, nodes, etc. Miners just chase profits.

That was an alternate proposal called tail removal.
One could make a histogram of block intervals. We would hopefully see that the majority of blocks take around 10 minutes (the goal) and we could judge how well we reached that goal.
Correct, and it went smoothly.
"> But I thought hard forks were simple and easy and there are no problems doing them on abbreviated time schedules?

If all the miners agree and the code is tested well enough, that's true. If you have shitty code and differing opinions on the hardforking change suggested, you'll most likely fork the chain. I don't personally think either of those are problematic, though.

> Bitcoin Cash doesn't even have many nodes and clients installed around the world..

Cash has roughly 1800 nodes. Core has 7800. So that's 25%. I think that's a good amount of nodes given that the value of the chain is less than 25% of that of the core chain currently.

Roughly the same goes for hasrate: about 20% currently.

I don't see a problem.

It was a self destructively stupid business plan that they were short sighted and arrogant enough to think they could pull off without issue.

"In fact, if Core had even only increased the blocksize by 1MB as per the HKA, they would have segwit and we wouldn't be having a BCH/BTC war.

It really makes you suspicious why they are so adamantly against a tiny blocksize increase.

"
That's a great explanation, thanks! It pretty much blows the argument that bigger blocks centralize Bitcoin because nodes wouldn't be able to afford the storage. Even before I learned about this detail, the argument is still super bizarre. 
Right, so in your world where nobody trusts anybody, we need 7 billion nodes?
Good enough for you maybe. That's fine. I'll keep my node thanks.
How is that like central banking? I'm talking about the tech aspects of it. Full nodes that don't contribute to POW (and by extension the security of the blockchain) are wasting everyone's time.
"r/bitcoin started banning people irl - confirmed.
"
Well I wasn't doing any of that, and still got banned. So, you know, don't throw the baby out too.
I'm not so sure, actually. Unless you want to validate yourself, that is, of course.
But Segwit is diet coke. BCH is just changig the size of the bottle.
No then what you call Bitcoin today is actually bcorecoin and satoshi's code is Bitcoin.
"You've got a brand new product called iPhone. People are loving it so much that they fill up its 1MB of RAM memory with all the app they are using and it makes the device so slow that's it's barely usable.

Solution 1: update the firmware to make it run your app in a remote server in the cloud and you just visualize them in a browser. It works and it's still the original hardware of the iPhone but app are still slow to run when internet connection is slow and doesn't work offline.

Solution 2: sell the exact same version of iPhone but with 8MB of RAM that allow much more app to run making the device as fast as new again.

Which solution look like the real original experience of the iPhone?

Only difference is that Apple will sell the version with more RAM the full price to original owner when BCH where free for orignal BTC owner."
"* Techincally, **""Bitcoin"" BTC is not Bitcoin any more** as SegWit broke one of its working principles and changed the code into something that is not Bitcoin system any more.

"Well I’ve tried not to comment on that, but it’s worth noting that not every node can run pruned (lite) nodes - a significant number need to run full nodes

Similarly not every node can drop Tx from the mempool after an hour, or low fee economy transactions stop being possible "
What are you trying to defend here?
Your hilarious argument in favour of centralisation keeps me amused daily.
Mining full nodes today are million $ businesses. I don’t trust them
If mining nodes can only ask/receive tx data from a few other nodes it shouldn't trust anyway, that would be bad. Non mining nodes increase the chances of building your ledger without trust because fewer people with an incentive to lie to you can. Plus, running your own node increases your privacy since you don't have to ask anyone for balance info.
"What don't you trust about them? 

That they'll mine invalid blocks? (You can verify this yourself, and other miners will reject the block)

That they'll double spend? (Other miners will keep them in check)

That they'll withhold your transactions? (There are more than one miner. They will mine it.)

Decentralisation should not be confused with redundancy."

"Technically, Bitcoin Cash came into existence ~3 months ago. Bitcoin emerged and pioneered the space in 2009. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash, that's why they have two different names and have an eight year span between their arrival into the space (one of which actually created the space nearly 10 years ago).

It's just like saying Diet Coke is the real Coca-Cola because it has less sugar and subjectively tastes better to you. That doesn't negate the fact that it was an offshoot of the original recipe, which, because of its conception provided an opportunity for Diet Coke to exist in the first place. Despite it being 'improved' to adhere to rules of the new recipe. "
Really? Because I'm using it...
No I'll do it
That's not P2P rofl
At what point are you describing something other than a central banking system?
I'd never use it to send a dollar. Let's be realistic. I use LTC an ETH for sending small amounts. Only time I'm moving BTC it's a few hundred dollars worth minimum. Anyhow point is while BTC isn't usable for everything it certaintly is being used. In fact it is being used by far more people than BCH considering that BTC sees 10x the transaction volume of BCH. That's a fact. 
In fact, post your bch address and I'll send you a dollars worth.
">  In fact it is being used by far more people than BCH considering that BTC sees 10x the transaction volume of BCH. That's a fact.

No shit. LTC, ETH and BTC have been around for a lot longer."
"I could buy and send ETH and LTC in a fraction of the time that I can send BCH. Why would I every use BCH? 

Also BCH can only handle 4x the transaction capacity of BTC. BCH blocks are 8x as big but BTC has Segwit now so it's more like 4x the capacity on BCH."
"I understand that. So it has morphed into something else. It's still the same entity.

When a friend turns into a drug addict and exhibits a night and day difference from the person you once used to know, he is still that person. He's just changed.

You get what I'm saying? I get what you're saying and I'm aware of all that. Nonetheless, it still is the entity Bitcoin, it's just not the Bitcoin we grew up with. "
"Youre not understanding what I'm saying.  I'm not saying Segwit was added in Bitcoin Cash.  I'm saying most of the Bitcoin Cash software is **stuff written by Core devs**. Go look at the Bitcoin ABC repo that you claim is the original bitcoin  and let me know how many Core dev commits you see in the history:

I use Copay, so that address is the new format. You can use this tool to convert it if your wallet doesn't support it: https://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/"
I'm verifying my own transactions, that's what I do. A full node is the only way to make transactions on the bitcoin network
I think you want to say that bitcoin has the economic majority and so it is bitcoin but u/---Ed--- says bitcoin is the principles created by Satoshi which Core's bitcoin doesn't follow anymore. Thanks for keeping it civil.
"No its not the same entity. Bitcoin is a system which is defined in Bitcoin white paper. When it changes into different system it is no longer the same Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is only a system (coin) that uses that original system/principles. Anything that is different but wants to use the name of Bitcoin, is a fake, an impostor... and this is what Core Bitcoin with SegWit is... its a fake... it Bitcoin just because of name that they inherited."
Simply having multiple nodes is a drain on the network
I said too many full nodes. 
That’s all it does though, is tell you whether or not it’s verified. It doesn’t do anything to help you if verification fails. 
This. There we go. Well said. 
"It's also far more useful. Every altcoin has faster confirmation times than BTC/BCH.

You replied to the wrong comment by the way."
SPVs
Unless you’re also mining your own transactions, it’s not actually doing anything except making you feel better about yourself. 
No, because their full node is servicing many requests. Just like ledger, electrum and trezor's nodes. Full nodes are important but too many is actually harmful to the network. Your raspberry pi is not doing anything to help the network.
Depends on what kind of security... Privacy offers security of nobody can tell how much bitcoin you have. You don't have to ask other nodes if you run one yourself.
"It doesn't matter how gaslit you are, something that came into existence is the thing that came into existence. You can say BCH is an improved upon implementation of what Bitcoin intended to be, but it doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin is Bitcoin and as an emerging tech it's experiencing problems with the network that haven't been addressed in an optimal way.

Im invested in both, calling it my bitcoin is silly since I'm not Nakamoto Satoshi.

This argument is ridiculous. It's circular. I get what you're saying but you're not taking what I'm saying literally enough. Literally bitcoin is bitcoin. Literally bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash and what defines bitcoin cash are the new rules in the code that improved the btc core code.

You're missing my point. 

See Jihan:

https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/926076475656126466"
"> And technically, Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin now as it is exactly how your Bitcoin was 9 years ago... the way Satoshi created it

The Bitcoin Cash code is **not** exactly how Bitcoin was 9 years ago, far from it.  Bitcoin Cash includes over 13 thousand code changes since Satoshi's version.  The vast majority of those changes were made by Bitcoin Core developers.  If you like the Bitcoin Cash software, you happen to like code containing thousands of deviations from Satoshi's version, some small, some large.

Please stop pretending that Bitcoin Cash is some perfect mirror of Satoshi's original code: it's actually quite, quite different in many significant ways, mostly thanks to all the Core volunteers' hard work over the years."
I believe you.
So Coinbase should turn off their node then?
Not everyone needs that level of privacy. My friends, relatives, don't have the skill to do it themselves and trust me more than xyz wallet company, so they can connect to mine.
"> What don't you trust about them?

The idea of cryptocurrency is to trust no one. That's why I'm running my own node. Everything else is philosophical
"
"> That they'll mine invalid blocks? (You can verify this yourself, and other miners will reject the block)

How do you verify this yourself without running a full node, the very thing you just told people not to do?"
"1FVCFccZTqrTuB45jn7XC7Aqis62yKDY5V 

I've been following cryptos for a long time but only recently actually bought some"
Agreed, bitcoin's use case is not digital currency... you just need to hold it and then dump it for a higher price on the next fool. :)
Yea right now, it's also a fact bch can handle 8 times. More transactions than btc,. And it's cheaper and faster. You wanna send that 500 bucks and not have it take 2 days? How much that gonna cost you? I could buy and send btc in a minutes for a few cents, why would I use btc again?  Store of value blah blah the fact is its less useful in many use cases than most cryptos.
"I am not missing anything, you are the one that is missing the point.

The Bitcoin that was created 9 years ago, is not what Bitcoin Core with SegWit is now. The very reason we have Bitcoin Cash fork is because the Core developers working for Blockstream have CHANGED the Bitcoin from 9 years ago into something different, and want to change it even more later on... and the people that suported Bitcoin from its start from 9 years ago, age attacked by the Core and Blockstream, called as enemy of Bitcoin.

it is completely absurd that anyone with any common sense to think that Core are protecting Bitcoin from, what they call, corporate takeover. Core are the ones that are working for corporate and banking institutions."
According to that argumentation I can say that bitcoin does not exists anymore. If the changes of bch in regard to btc define bch than it is equally valid to say that current btc is actually a segwit coin as it deviates from the original btc. Therefore your argumentation of what is btc cannot be based on when it came into existance.
Code changes do not define that something is different. Code changes are implementation details. In the context of a system like this the system is defined by its specification, not its implementation.
"Nope, the thousands of lines of code added by Core's coin now has which is what SegWit shit added, which Bitcoin Cash doesn't have. It is you that is pretending (or you just don't realise it) that Core is what changed Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Cash fork was created before the SegWit changes were added... not after."
I actually did this with strangers in the internet back in the day. Can't do that today for many reasons. (But you can again with bch)
"No it isn't.

How did you ever get that idea?

Where in the Bitcoin specs did you get that idea: http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/ ?

Bitcoin as a system *never* intended people to all run full nodes, in fact the exact opposite is closer to the truth for what we all invested in. "

Yep, because no one's using it.

priceless!
It would be good to compare both UTXO set size.
I run both a BCH and a BTC full node on a $5/mo VPS host (500GB disk, 512MB RAM). Both will scale at least for the next 2-3 years.
I run a BCH node too, but on a server, its over 1TB of bandwidth so far. I do it on my own free will, because I support BCH.
Let's say I want to try this with my Pi3. How would I proceed from here?
yes because swap space is so expensive to think about in /r/btc
You realize that once BCH's blocks fill up, its mempool will be larger than bitcoin's, right? 
...really makes me laugh.
Why?
"I've been arguing that idea:  the best thing to do with ""spam"" is confirm it so it goes to your cheap hard drive.  Disk is so cheap and anyway you can prune so this idea seems true so long as tx relay fees are nonzero."
"In Bitcoin Core 0.12 and later there is a memory pool limiter which can be configured with -maxmempool=<n>, where <n> is the size in MB (1000), 300 by default.

To completely disable mempool functionality there is the option -blocksonly. This will make the client opt out of receiving (and thus relaying) transactions completely, except as part of blocks."
"Genuine question, wouldnt the same thing happen to the BCH pool if it were to take off like BTC has? 

t. total n00b"
What makes you think BCH will not encounter the same problems in far less time?
Because is is fake news. I’m running a BTC node on a raspberry pi myself
"I had an early Pi that had 256MB but half was reserved for the GPU, leaving 128MB for the system 

Later units defaulted to 192 system 64 graphics"

Still somewhat surprised that I got ignored as opposed to banned."
Nah... this is DAYS worth of back-up for BTC. For this many transactions to be in the BCH mempool they would need to all have been posted within the last ~10 minutes (or whatever time since the last block) since BCH is able to clear the entire mempool with every block at the current BTC transaction volume. IOW, a buildup of transactions of this magnitude couldn’t happen for BCH at the current BTC transaction rate.
I have a toaster lying around. Any tutorials to turn it into a full node? Thanks

Yeah, but I did have to tweak the mempool settings for the initial download and again after it was finished because it’s not optimized for memory usage yet
512 < 256?
I don't think you understand. Full nodes that do not mine are just wasting the time of full nodes that do mine. They're spending resources listening to your node waiting for a block that will never come. It extends the distance between mining nodes for no reason. Mining nodes are very interconnected. The distance between two mining nodes is normally just one or two nodes. If it has to go through a bunch of other useless full nodes, you're just slowing down the network 
"Yeah, at that point you're better off using blocks-only mode (a Core ""innovation"", incidentally), and at that point, even the very debatable network benefits of running a full node are further watered down.

Nope. Bitcoin's motto is verify, not trust.
"It helps mining nodes have a blockchain to download, but elsewise doesn't help anyone's security. 

Math is real. Random sampling works. Asking a number of random nodes is a tx really happened should be good enough for everyone who isnt' a miner."

"You just set the memory pool expiry, either by a flag or a config.

You can set it to an hour, 24 hours, or forever.

In most implementations you can also configure a maximum memory pool size, in which case transactions will automatically be dropped once your allocated memory is full - typically on a “first in, first out” basis, but this can again vary by implementation.

Your node will still receive and forward new transactions and validate/propagate new blocks, and as long as it does this there’s not usually any need for non-mining nodes to keep transactions once they’ve been forwarded to your peer nodes, because you know at that stage the transaction will be forwarded on to the mining nodes. It’s good practice to keep as many as you can for at least a reasonable period, though.

All of those affect memory (RAM), but if you want to reduce hard drive usage that’s a little different. To affect storage space usage, you can “prune” the blockchain, and only keep recent transactions. Typically you would do this if your node only needs to ensure the recent blockchain is valid to validate new transactions, eg you don’t need to see the blockchain from 2011 in order to accept a $2 coffee payment in 2017. You can limit this by size or by a time period (specified in either blocks or days/weeks/months/year’s). And as above, specifics will depend on your node implementation (eg which software you’re running)"
"No.  That's not how it works.
You see, not  only can BCH clear the mempool faster, it can increase block size so that the blocks don't ""fill up"".
The notion of a ""full block"" is nonsense."
imaginary/artificial 'problem'.
Anyway, running a full node contributes nothing to either the network or yourself.
