"I think the biggest scam is that bch doesn't have the price that btc had. That ""bch"" became the fork, but BTC was the one changing into ""bitelitecoin"" or a significantly different coin, no longer would be peer to peer uncensorable as decentralized or incentivized the same. The economics changed fundamentally, so does the security. 

We will find out if this new coin is hackable. As to why BTC didn't go through the process of finding a new market price like BCH did, you will likely find those who control how the coin forks, have the power over it.

Bitcoin isn't bitcoin anymore. The world is no longer the way it used to be... Bitconnneeeeccccttttt"
"> The mods made an exception for me on this post as a PR move.

Thanks for the laugh, it's been a long day and that ridiculous statement was just what I needed!"
"Hmm ... what a bizarre analogy, says volumes for your state of mind (cray cray)

BCH is just an altcoin trying to use the fallout from the scaling debate and r/bitcoin moderation policies to demonise Bitcoin and yet, try to become Bitcoin.  BCH should focus on just being BCH because that is what it is, nothing more and nothing less. "

Never heard of you
"The following is the text I received from them, they didn’t mention why I was banned! Maybe there was no reason. 😱😂😂😂

“You've been banned from participating in r/Bitcoin
• 40d
You have been banned from participating in r/Bitcoin. You can still view and subscribe to r/Bitcoin, but you won't be able to post or comment.

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/Bitcoin by replying to this message.

Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.”

🙄 And I wonder about the “Reminder from the Reddit staff”. Is it true from the Reddit staff?"

Congrats!! lol
"You're right there, but I'm optimistic about the future of several different DAG's.  It's new technology among new technology but its very promising.

I just don't see PoW blockchains ever being able to scale to the levels of being a practical currency without massive centralization of people with specialized hardware and electricity cost.  PoC and PoS blockchains are interesting as well for issues of scale, but I think the ""real bitcoin"" will be a DAG."
"You, an idiot: ""We forked the original chain in order to realise a different vision""

Me, an intellectual: ""IF JOHN OLIVER DIDNT EVEN MENTION IT UR USELESS LMAO"""
"BTC and BCH share a common lineage.   BTC sub was created so that people can talk about the development of a sister network without facing harsh censorship from the Bitcoin Core group.  It was necessary for a new community to be created, since those in control of other communities were acting against the self interest of the Free and Open Source philosophies of the original project. 

You can also still talk about BTC here.  It's just more people are interested in BCH fork of the Bitcoin chain since it doesn't seem stagnated.   "
It seems you're not the shit until you get yourself one a these puppies
r/bitcoin keeping it classy
"I honestly think it could be an attack on the community, as that reddit post was up at the same time questioning people's investments. The show had some good points, but still had a FUD vibe, the reddit post was FUD but from what I read the guy potentially getting divorced over his investment, tripled it?

All in all maybe like trump, any publicity is good pub. So I'm not sure if it will help or hurt btc. I dislike the fact that they did ""research"" but didn't mention  r/btc. "
"Congratulations, son.

I have one word for you - Plastics."
haha!
All I can say to that BS is that a good dose of milk of magnesia would help sort you out :)
You're confusing marketing with astroturfing. 
I thought I'd give an update on the BIP70 issue. Turns out ElectronCash is already supporting it, but [forgot an import statement](https://github.com/fyookball/electrum/issues/581#issuecomment-370187972). I had assumed that the fault was on BitPay's side for breaking the protocol. If they begin adding these supported wallets to their official list, then I am going to be content. :-)
Why doesn’t the market cap reflect this comic? The market favors Bitcoin over BCH 10:1.
You’re retarted.
"well they blame ""bcash"" for everything"
good job, there is soo much freeloader in this world, It fun to see the original guy posting his own stuff :) /u/tippr $0.5

I don't know. I would suspect the trolls reported me. Happened just before @Bitcoin got suspended.  
"So you just ignored all of the points I made. Great, it seems like you just want to talk and not have a conversation so have fun.

>Cut your loses and move on

Losses? Hah, If you've generated losses in the last year you're doing things very wrong.
Why do you even care? If it's already done why are you even here discussing this? This is crypto, go be your own bank and let us do the same."
This. 
mmmm. not so obvious reasons, why was it suspended.
Hahahah sorry we have two and one is enjoying a rest period too... and for obvious reasons as well, I suspect the same xD
Tweet tweet, BCH  is worth 1/10 of bitcoin despite sharing the same history. Tweet tweet, lol. 
The coin split in two on August 1st 2017. Both coins share the same history before that date. Anyone who bought bitcoin before August 1st was also buying future BCH. For some reason BCH crashed in value relative to BTC despite BCH supposedly having a better plan for scaling. As it turns out the market has chosen Segwit and lightning as a scaling solution over raising the block size. Cut your loses and move on. This whole sub is circle jerking into the abyss, and this comic is either tragic irony or doublethink.
Yeah right. Keep believing that! The Bitcoin community's been beaten to a pulp since 2014. Time to react appropriately. If they whine about it, it means its working.
"No need to boycott when you would never have moved or spent your BTC anyway.

"
Sure there is, no one asked Blockstream to step in and hijack our community and project 4 years ago and turn it into a living hell. 
much appreciated

"What do you think drives the market cap? 

Technology is part of it, but do you think that's a bigger part than first mover advantage, or being top of mind in terms of branding?
Have you ever had a friend come ask you about zcash or digibyte or seen a news article about them? Have you ever had a friend ask you about bitcoin or seen a new article about it?

Finally, how does one get into crypto without going through bitcoin? Almost every alt is paired with bitcoin, very few alts pair with fiat.

Lol
"thats because bcash is trash and roger ver is a scammer

so funny that you dont even know that

lol bcash"
these are fantastic. 
"I just asked for a reason why we should keep the 1MB transaction limit? 

I was insulted told to ""fork off"" and banned. 

The reasons I've been told to keep the 1MB limit are nonsense, no thinking person should accept such shallow answers. 

I say 1MB transaction limit because it used to be called the block size limit, the Core Developers in charge just changed the name to **""non-witness data limit""**, thinking everything will be OK and no one bats an eye? The transaction limit is still restricting total transaction capacity to a measly 1MB, why?  

OH and P.S. we forked off and now we're being accused of stealing the Bitcoin name, attacking Bitcoin. mmm No. 

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, it's just upgraded to remove the 1MB transaction limit because there were no valid reasons to keep it in place.
