"And they dare use the name ""libra""..."
Banks can. Paypal can. Why can't they?
I think Libra is beneficial to bitcoim.Coinbase is one of its partner we can easily swap crypto for libra to use in the Libra block chain. Crypto will be more in demand and hence the value will go up if people start using crypto to buy Libra specially the unbanksa countries.
"this! except Libra will also be a ""cryptocurrency"" so regulators will want to up their game, interesting times ahead"
"An extra added bonus feature for advertisers. 

For just 19.95 per customer , you can become the only authorized seller for them. They will not be permitted to buy the product you sell from anyone besides you !!"
This shit won’t happen, sick of this stupid shit being spread around. They can’t block you from your money. If they did they’d get sued to hell for locking up funds.
Control the language, and you control the conversation.
"It's because some fat people felt discriminated by fit people having a channel about fitness, and some vegetarians where offended by some people trying to lose weight eating meat, and mass reported them, and facebook had a look, consulted zucks political agenda and went ""jep, let's nuke that shit""."
I prefer ZuckBucks... has kinda a better ring to it.
Coinbase freeze your account and do completely new anal probe just for logging on when on holidays.
Coinbase is free to do what it wants.  You can always keep your wallet on your phone or PC and not worry about anyone freezing your crypto.
"Banks seem to get away with it.

PayPal seems to get away with it.

Facebook will too. Fortunately that's why it will just be just another bank/paypal competitor rather than a cryptocurrency competitor."
With IDIOTS.
Dont buy into there shit to begin with. Stay far from facebook as possible.
Bit of a contradiction... but okay
"Libra is more weight related or currency related and not towards ""Freedom"" in my guess"
Okay
\*laughs in PayPal\*
Does someone have a link to the community standards?
those facebookers and their sex trafficking
I've heard reports of Coinbase doing something similar when people used coins on known online gambling sites.  I'd be very surprised if something like this _didn't_ happen.
Damn, well that certainly wont fly....
I like what Leo Laporte calls them: Zuckbucks
99% chance this will happen...
"Recently Facebook stomped on some big crossfit and ketogenic diet channels, because it doesn't align with libtard vegetarian fat acceptance values.

So yeah, it's nice to know you can only use Libra if your values happen to align with silicon valey/zuck/libtard values, and otherwise you'll get booted off it."
I need a lizard to tell me when I can and can't access my surveillancecoin
Use your Libra to buy BCH, and never look back
Brrrr, it’s so true
