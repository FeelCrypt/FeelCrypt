He definitely seems like a guy who is very tied into the mainstream narratives.  Whether he is conscious of it or not, I'd say he is definitely not on the side of liberty.
"You get downvoted for saying ""everyone"" does this or that. Like we're all loonies and as if there are no loonies on r/bitcoin...

Aside from being a well known left wing propagandizer already, he probably just didn't know anything about this sub. Just like he made fun of EOS, without really knowing much about it at all."

I hate to feed the troll, but this is obvious. Oliver’s piece was about the basics of cryptocurrency, not the endless Internet politicking around it. 
I have never heard of the conspiracy theory that people are trying to hide the existence of this sub.  Thus, your comment and your doubling down on your non-argument are stupid.

Me too.
Just write a post that says “Hi”.  Your username will take care of the rest. 
Nope. You're free to pump litecoin or bash bitcoin cash all you want.
R/bitcoin is okay with ltc and xmr because they are blockstream controlled shitcoins like BTC who’s roadmap is LN and more cryptopussies.
So yes then.
"Wait, you're talking about BitcoinSegwit, right? Because according to block chain length, BCH is the original coin closest in function to the original, and BTC is the shitty altcoin held by centralized, pro-fiat wankers that only want to use bitcoin as a pump and dump ponzi scheme (HODL!) and not a usable currency.

If your response is ""bitcoin isn't supposed to be a currency!"" the Satoshi whitepapers disagree with you here, too, and this makes BTC the shitty altcoin.

/r/bitcoin is totally fucked. I got banned for talking about how people were getting banned. I was then banned for discussing the banning that doesn't happen.

As far as mainstream media goes Bitcoin is Bitcoin. By that I mean most don’t know or care about the difference between BTC or BCH. It was a segment explaining crypto currency, and diving into the difference between BTC and BCH wasn’t in the scope of that segment.

I doubt John Oliver cares to take a side over the BTC/BCH bickering. "
So Blockstream owns the name Bitcoin and they decide what can be called that?
Seriously do you actually think that Roger paid @Bitcoin? People can't change their opinions and think for themselves? The person who owns that twitter account worked hard on that profile to make it popular. Do you think you & the core mob have the right to take that account away from them?

It's trolling. A ban is harsh, but he's still an internet troll.
So they banned a troll...and now he’s pissed. Whoopty doo. 
"Shouting ""Bitcoin Cash"" everywhere is tasteless, although I sort of get the point.

Bitcoin Cash is an adoption route. The idea is not to hinder consumer adoption. The more ordinary people use Bitcoin to make their real lives better, the more protected we become from a state-size attack. It is pretty much the most important measure against centralization and the most crucial ideological goal.

If LN is satisfactory and competitive, people would start preferring that over on-chain transactions. Presumably on Bitcoin Cash.
"
I'm new to the sub, could you point me to something that explains what they do and why this sub exists?
Please reconsider tipping core trolls. They ain't going to change their mind over 2 bucks and all they will do is convert it to BTC. Seems daft to me.

I call a spade a spade, sorry if I hurt your feelings. When people publicly celebrate their banning as some kind of measure of success it reveals their character as a proud trouble maker. r/Bitcoin has endured too many of those and its great to see another one being banned. 
You sound scared.
There is no conspiracy. You’re being downvoted because you are an idiot. John Oliver didn’t mention /r/btc because this sub isn’t censored to shit like /r/bitcoin is
Cryptopussies. Fluffy pony is a pure Blockstream shill and in bed with the likes of Samson Mow, Greg Maxwell and Cob Lee. It's blatantly obvious. 
Bad bot.
"That’s the narrative they’re trying to push here anyway. Whatevr you got to do to get people to buy BCH so you can use covert asic boost and have a 20% advantage over other miners. 

With bitcoin transaction fees so low now, what’s the advantage of BCH? "
"To be honest, it’s fun to watch the mental gymnastics of people here trying to say BCH is actual bitcoin, or that the market has chose BCH over bitcoin. It was a blatant and failed attack on and it’s fun to dive into a crowd of morons and ask questions and get loaded answer after loaded answer.

You can like both coins, I guess. But Roger Ver going on CNBC and saying BCH is bitcoin and refering to bitcoin as bitcoin core is a special kind of stupid. Literally all he had to do is not sell his bitcoins and he could end up one of the most influential people in the world, and he’s blowing it."
So then, Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is legal tender in japan. Is that not one of the governments of this world allowing a public currency? 
">It's a very calm place for me,

Explans a lot.

Where to start. Let's look at every thread that mentions cobra's recent tweets. Have they deleted all the death threats there yet?"
"Mum jokes, yeah about the intellect I’d expect from this sub.

I mean the fact the sub is r/btc which is the ticker for the real bitcoin. Goes to show the intention to deceive."
I personally wasn't trying to push the pros and cons of either crypto, the problem I have personally with /r/Bitcoin is the censorship involved. It prevents healthy discussion and it actually hurts the coin's reputation. 
No one is using btc. Good job. If they ever get another price spike, fees will sky rocket again. 
The thing people like you fail to realize is that the *dollar* value of bitcoin is completely irrelevant if you can trade it directly for goods and services, which you can do with BCH, but not with BTC. BCH *is already* working as money. BTC is no longer usable as money. That's why it's not going to last.
Sure.
Yawn 
"Incorrect. It is not 'legal tender' in Japan. 

Japan has officially recognized bitcoin as a method of payment. 

"
"Try as you might ...  but all you are doing is boring me with dribble.
But I upvoted you because I'm nice :)"
Sorry, sister...
You realize BTC transactions are as cheap as BCH transaction right now, right? And also lightning transactions are orders of magnitude cheaper than BCH transactions. Turns out Segwit and lighting were the right path and it’s a matter of time before BCH is massively more expensive to use than BTC. This is why the market values BTC over BCH 10:1.
[deleted]
So it’s legal? 
Routing is an unsolved problem with Lightning. And likely as bandwith-consuming as onchain scaling. So why bother?
They’re bagholders man, they’re so emotionally tied to their loses that they blame BTC instead of their own gullibility....It’s typical for the rubes of snake oil salesman when their confirmation bias begins to crumble.  
Hopefully you will go down like your mother. 
It's a very calm place for me, not sure what threads you have been lurking in.. and you seem to think I may care if you or anyone upvoted me in this sub. Please don't flatter yourself :D
"On chain scaling was discussed openly UNTIL the tyrannical outbursts and threats from the big blockers destroyed civil discussion. It came under strict moderation and I'm very happy about that and so are many thousands of others that frequent that forum. 

Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin with a superiority complex which is unfounded and quite laughable. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, end of story.

Global adoption is a nonsense, if you believe the governments of this world will allow a public currency to take over you have been severely misled. 
"
That is definitey true. It was the only option other than BTC and ETH which at one time had $40 and $1 transactions respectfully during the climb. No where else for people to go, but also it was being pushed as the payment coin and BTC the store of value coin by Blockstreamers...which is the dumbest thing ever.
"r/bitcoin is where you go to freely discuss the one and only Bitcoin, not clones or altcoins.

"Honestly? You can’t even input into the discussion without talking to John Oliver directly? My god this sub loves authority, lol.

You can’t even speculate here? I’m just trying to understand what you guys think is going on. Do you think John was paid off by core to mention /r/bitcoin and refer to BTC as bitcoin? Because John isn’t here you can’t even answer my quesition?"
"You can add him to the list of enemies I guess. It’s getting hard to keep track. Even Nick Szabo, the guy who made bitgold before Satoshi had released the white paper is considered an enemy here. Whatever it takes to dupe noobs into buying an altcoin that can be mined with ASIC boost I guess. 


But you guys still haven’t answered the question. Dodgy as fuck here.."
The mods made an exception for me on this post as a PR move. /r/BTC is the biggest herd of sheep. Very easy to manipulate anyone dumb enough to think BCH is bitcoin. 
So, what you’re saying is that in the mainstream...BTC is Bitcoin?

There are no heated conflicts here on r/btc, just as there are no personal threats. 

**The on-chain scaling is an integral part of Bitcoin, and you absolutely cannot discuss it freely on r/Bitcoin since mid 2015. Many people who were into bitcoin since the very beginning were banned there due to censorship, and this fact is the reason why r/btc subreddit exists and why Bitcoin is continuing it’s march towards global adoption under BCH ticker.**

Considered an enemy by whom? I still think he's actually Satoshi. Too bad he called Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"" on twitter, but that's just how the world works. People change their mind or have radically different ideas from what they communicate some times.

Of course he mentioned rBitcoin, because it's the mainstream hub that all people go to when they see Bitcoin on the news. Then they proceed to consume all the nonsense there and don't see the information that gets systematically deleted. To know the full history you have to do a whole lot more research than what you would do on a show on cryptocurrencies.
Likely because he could be accused of pushing certain cryptos, whereas “Bitcoin” is often mentioned in the media without much blowback for hocking a currency someone is invested in.

That’s probably not true at all. It’s pretty likely that this video just *actually* is bad and is reported accordingly . This is how the system works and you might just be upset that your views are being blocked.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have replace by fee so no double spend threat.

I personally also like the green logo better but not everyone agrees..."
Tell him to click next after selecting Bitcoin. THEN you can see Bitcoin Cash option.
"But RBF is opt-in, right? So unless the sender explicitly makes the payment a RBF payment, there is no difference in the experience.

Not sure what happens when somebody sends an RBF tx though. Probably BitPay would have to wait for confirmation which would suck in terms of confirmation time.

Can we add a ""no-rbf-flag"" to the invoice QR code in order to tell wallets to not pay that invoice using RBF?"
This is great. I know how I'm buying my surface book when I'm ready to make the purchase!
I'm not against Linux at all. What I'm trying to say is that r/bitcoin always ends up boycotting something for the reason that A company supports something which they don't like.
Why is the logo green? Should it be orange like the original Bitcoin?
wow it's handy!
where bullish ? :)

Yes, 0-conf also works with BTC when you pay via BitPay. 
Very important move
Major step forward

Yeah good news !
LOL they are now boycotting microsoft: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83z099/we_should_support_linux_over_microsoft/
How is 0-conf secure? You should be able to double spend by transmitting another transaction with higher fees.
And another wall was broken, Microsoft acceptance of crypto currency it's one of the reasons the currency is about to be another norm of modern era, just like iPads, computers and social medias before it.
Awesome to see BCH used for real. Can you add that place to [Marco Coino](https://www.coinline.co.nz/marco-coino/)? It's available on both Android and iPhone now.
