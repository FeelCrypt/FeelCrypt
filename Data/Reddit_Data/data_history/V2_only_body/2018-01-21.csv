Majority isn't binary.
The one point that I've come to appreciate with bitcoin is that it's been the biggest bug bounty ever. People have been trying to hack it for years. It may be slow and expensive compared to the coin of the week, but it's been tested by the world and is still standing. 
Actually I agree with you that crypto is anti-fragile. However, it reaching mainstream adoption, is non-trivial.

It will basically be a new way to do credit card transactions where it's basically impossible for anyone to create fraudulent transactions, thus saving the credit card / debit card industry billions.

It's a complete waste of what the blockchain technology was created to do.

Blockstream simply wants to improve the financial industry and sell to them and make a cut of transactions. They are Ripple Corp 2.0, quite literally. They probably have ambitions of spinning up unique blockchains for sovereign governments and teaching them how to manage their own cryptocoins also.

"**Majority**

A majority is the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements.

""Majority"" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a ""majority vote"". A majority vote is more than half of the votes cast.

Simple math: Nash theorem. Bitcoin Core has capacity limits (economic activity overflew and market share dropped from 9/10 to 1/3 over several months) both in raw numbers and complexity which means costs (LN), Bitcoin Cash has a magnitude less limits with potential to add several magnitudes later. Miners switched November 12nd, with DAA next (and likely the last) switch will occur sometime later, maybe months later

I agree, this sort of thing has historically paid off. It's a damn shame, but I can't deny the truth of it.

How can it do that if Lightning node operators are supposed to take a cut of each transaction they pass on???

"Lightning will likely work, it just won't work at scale past 1 million nodes and may not be as cheap as they think.

What the 3rd layer will do is add regional routing to local lightning networks.

It's like having a cabby system. A cabby system cannot get you from Los Angeles to New York, but airplanes can.

Between the two of them you have point to point people routing.

However, how they think they can do this cheaply is beyond me."
"> How can it scale on 3rd layer without a working 2nd layer? That's absurd.

Because scaling is how it fails. It's not that it won't be able to send money at all, it just won't be able to scale.

It's like having cabbies to take you anywhere in a city, that's one ""transportation layer."" But cabbies cannot take you city to city, you use airplanes for that, kind of like a 3rd layer.

It has that chance right now. But as long as scaling on Lightning with BTC is still plausible, people will not abandon BTC in droves and create the flippening event. That's what I'm referring to."

I disagree. Ethereum not so long ago had noticable backlog, it it'll be happening more frequently, fees will rise and utility icluding ICO boom will bleed out on other open blockchains. Also PoW > PoS in my estimation: more expensive to rewrite the ledger (and no DAO shitshow in Bitcoin), clearer security model. In PoS blocks are signed by stakeholders and Ethereum was crowdsaled"

True here. 50% to 0%. I thought btc would help me retire, noe I'm convinced it's going to end badly.

Furthermore how is it not malicious to prevent the scaling of the most important financial and social invention in 500 years in favor of a hypothetical protocol that requires a hitherto unsolvable CS problem to be solved? If he thought he was smarter than Satoshi he should have done his own thing like so many others have done with alts. But instead he wormed his way into commit access (and who really knows how that happened given Gavin and his children were being threatened during this time) and used the bitcoin brand for his own personal reward. If it can be shown he has suffered financially from Blockstream perhaps I'd change my mind. I really wish I had your ability to be so objective about this.

"Maybe you may not know it, but when the market attracts demand because of low wages, the increase in demand stimulates improvement in working conditions (including wages).

Asking for ""fair wages"" (that is, ""fair prices"", the same concept defended by socialists who make scarce products, creates bachaqueo and has raised the interest rates charged by people who change debt for cash) rejecting the demand attracted by low wages simply extends our ordeal. On the other hand, the fixing of ""minimum wages"" to the only ones that benefit is those who already have a job and who produce enough not to be dismissed. Those that produce less than the minimum price set unilaterally (by the State or collectively) are automatically excluded ... so ""minimum wages"" stimulate unemployment and raise barriers to entry.

By the way, a Venezuelan tells you that he also wants better salaries for Venezuelans, but that they are the result of effort, of nature and of not fighting against the market economy (that is, the abandonment of socialist philosophy). I do not want such things to come from the pity or coercion of the laws because that does not have a firm floor and because such measures create side effects that affect other people."

Yeah, it’s called “trade”. We tip them some much needed money, and in return we get the word spread on BCH and increased adoption, which will, in the long run, increase the real value of the coin. Too bad you can’t do that with your shitcoin. 
Unlike your crappy maimed CoreStreamCoin, BCH actually has the power to be useful to people. This was the plan all along, right? So why the salt?

Yes, I got the clever narrative of this generous campaign.. There are enough examples where low fees are important, such as buying anything below 50$. Actually, in Venezuela, crypto is more needed as a store-of-value, payments are not relevant at all. As SoV BTC is usually better.  
"[Bcash](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) is not Bitcoin Cash.

"So labor would be very cheap in terms of international standards, if the value delivered happens in time?

I'm also pondering the more selfish ideas of simply buying labor for personal projects on the cheap...

If it weren't for the unstable property rights that come with civil unrest, Id also ponder buying land/real estate and maybe move there in some years when things cool down.

hmm.. what to do.."
"If you mean BCC -> fiat: yeah, sure. Localbitcoincash for example.

If you mean Bolivares -> USD: there's a black market and people from all over the country is selling/buying all the time, but it's kind of shady and you have to be careful."
The black market
If you want to leverage venezuelan workforce for your projects, please pay them (us) a fair wage. Not up to international standars, but a negociated fee. We Venezuelan are great workers! Buying real estate sounds good too, but you have to be selective. There are plenty of opportunities here for people to invest, but you'll see revenue only in time!

">  crypto is more needed as a store-of-value

Its not. 

Have you ever had to carry a backpack filled with banknotes because of the high inflation to buy groceries with? I have, it's not fun. Have you ever had to go walking to your college, work, and house by foot because there was no cash? I have, it's not fun. Have you ever went a day without having a meal because there was no cash and the stores did not accept cards because there was no connection to the banks or the electricity went out? I have, it's not fun."
"Payments are incredibly important in Venezuela. So important, that Lenin said that the best way to destroy capitalism was to debauch the currency. He wasn't worried about stores of value like gold because he knew they were inefficient for commerce. He just wanted to destroy the means of fast and fluid payment.

People need to be able to efficiently exchange the value of their labor for a functioning economy. "
There is no point in buying $10 of BTC, if you'll pay $10 transaction fees when selling it on black market for actual dollars. Store of value is meaningless if it can't be moved around

That's a nice vision that I share. Currently though, you can easily protect yourself from inflation if you just hold something more stable than the bolivar. But finding businesses where you can spend BTC (not to mention BCH) is near impossible. 
wrong, we still need to eat and to do that you need bolivares

"Ah, i didn't know that. [This is better then](https://i.imgur.com/zj1QJGd.jpg). Is it *very* uncommon with a lower ""e""?"
Maybe we could have a tipping spree once or twice per month, that could help many to buy food and stuff.
yes that tipping spree was really helpfull,  there is a discussion right now on r/vzla for a new BCH enchange subreddit using Bolivares
[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real)! I made a [Brazilian version](https://i.imgur.com/9ePhFID.jpg) too, so we're good to go!
"[Bcash](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) is not Bitcoin Cash.

^^Beep ^^beep, ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot."
"[Bcash](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) is not Bitcoin Cash.

^^Beep ^^beep, ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot."
The fork is called Bitcoin Cash, not BCash. Nobody wants to be anything, we just promote the benefits of one over the other. In my opinion BCH is for daily use and small transactions, and BTC is more like a savings criptocurrency
For example, $10 is a months salary.
The moderators of r/vzla/ ask that please advise before making threads with tips, because the unexpected activity is altering the operation of the subreddit and helps the proliferation of newly created accounts. One better thing they could do is to tip the interventions in the normal discussions of the forum.
"Hi ya'll. I work for WooCommerce and want to make sure I clarify a few things. I can easily provide proof if needed.

1. WooCommerce is free and open source. This allows for an open and diverse community to create plugins for free and distribute it as they wish. The plugin mentioned in the article is a third-party plugin and is in no way associated officially with WooCommerce.
2. While I fully support the development of plugins that allow for more payment gateways, this is not unique. A quick search on WordPress.org will come up with many that do the same for a variety of cryptocurrencies.
3. There are millions of WooCommerce stores, not 380,000. Source: builtwith.com

This is not news I'm afraid but it's great to hear there's so much support for it!"
"Me too. Almost since BCH launch there have been gourl.io and later coinpayments.net came on board. This is NOT native woocommerce support.
"
Yeah after all this I took a look at their post history... doesn't fill me with confidence.
"Yeah, this is only big news is WooCommerce lets it into their app store, since most WooCommerce store owners know to go there. WooCommerce store owners typically don't download things from Github and upload them (though you can). 

Personally I think this falls into the category of announcement -> ""BIG NEWS!!!"" -> ???"
"Not spiteful or inaccurate. 

How many WooCommerce plugins have you written? You have to go through an approval process to be listed on https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/. WooCommerce didn't write this, and whoever is, isn't going to get approved. WooCommerce isn't ""supporting"" BCH. On the other hand, anyone can write an extension and have it listed on the Wordpress plugin directory - that's why there's so many 1 star plugins there. 

So what does this mean? WooCommerce isn't ""bringing"" the plugin to anyone. They aren't marketing it to those stores. None of those stores will see it in the primary extension store. If they are digging around and searching, they may find it on the plugin directory, along with the other 54,000 or so plugins they can find there to do other things (as opposed to the 300 well-curated extensions that WooCommerce officially supports)

Congrats on the 400+ upvotes, but seriously, there's no real journalism here. I probably did more in looking up the plugin counts than you did for the entire article."
You're in the wrong here pal, this article says nothing of substance. It really just talks about some guy making a plugin for Wordpress/Woocommerce that allows to pay with Bitcoin Cash. It's not such a big deal as it makes it. There are others too from a long time ago, like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6z4hzc/bitcoin_cash_payment_gateway_for_woocommerce/), or [this one](https://gourl.io/bitcoin-payments-woocommerce.html).
Nah dude no brigading or orchestration of any kind, just someone who’s done stuff on woo-commerce before. If you can show me why I’m wrong I’ll happily edit my comment to admit it. Stop with the petty sad tribalism mindset, nothing wrong with questions and criticisms in a healthy community.
[deleted]
When you add extensions to your WooCommerce site, do you use the official extensions page (https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/) or do you fish around looking for open source plugins in the Wordpress directory? Because this is the latter, and anyone can write a plugin for it. 
Remember I posted this much earlier. This thread has gotten a lot saner. At that stage it was full of people thinking this is major news that should take bch to the moon. Further, I maintain writing a plugin is nothing special. That said I wish the developer all the success with this, it doesn’t mean I think it was a bad idea or anything.
We're working on keeping acceptbitcoin.cash as updated as humanly possible :)
And the confirmation post, at least we can tag these two accounts. You'll have to make new ones.
And you still don’t have an idea, because even if it’s true you didn’t even question it. You just believed it. Are you trying to bring news to people, or pretend to.
"The Bitcoin Cash fork didn't affect Bitcoin at all.

So let me ask you a rhetorical question: Why is anyone even using Bitcoin Cash if Bitcoin is still perfectly functional? (Hint: It's not)"
Nah anyone can make a plugin for any crypto in next to no time. It really isn’t news or anything to get too excited about. Just a cool step with some potential.
Irrational market. Most players in the crypto-space are now Ponzi scheme investors. They are looking to get rich quick, and don't understand why crypto exists. News about merchant adoption means nothing to them, as they care only about USD.  Market fundamentals will win and price will go higher, but only after merchants actually start getting many orders paid by BCH.
Because it's not really news. Any developer can write a plugin. This isn't officially supported by WooCommerce.
"Sorry but no. Not at all. The news article is a bit misleading. Woocommerce is an ecommerce system that anyone can download and install. Used by hundreds of thousands of shops worldwide.

There's a shit tonne of plugins available for popular and weird and wonderful payment types.

How many people outside of the crypto circle do you know who have heard of BCH? Hell they probably wouldn't have known about BTC until late last year.

Then look at the proportion of all those people who own a shop. A small percentage I'm sure."
When some of these 380'000 retailers start actually accepting BCH, the price should rise.  And that's a good thing, since it will be natural price rise, not fueled purely by investor hype.
Have you tried it? Anywhere we can try it? 
From what we have read it is free but we'd like confirmation
"Maybe you should also apologize for implying that this is an official extension, when in reality, WooCommerce isn't ""bringing"" it to anyone? "
Except that Woo themselves won't be supporting BCH. This is just a third-party plugin that anyone who knows PHP (or knows how to pay an offshore developer $5/hour) could write.
The callback part is a bit odd. PHP, in a WordPress context, generally isn't always on. I'm wondering if he's providing an external service for that callback and the native part is speculation.
"I didn't try it yet but it is used on their site:

https://store.blockstream.com

WooCommerce Plugin: 

https://github.com/ElementsProject/woocommerce-gateway-lightning

NodeJS Library:

https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-charge"
Yeah, I'm skeptical. Seems too specific to be completely false, but announcing an open source project/product in this way is really odd at the same time.
I am bills complete lack of self awareness.
Apparently you are me. TIL.
"Sorry, I misunderstood what you meant by ""always on"". This is accurate :~)

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rofcq/im_launching_a_bitcoin_cash_payment_processor/) is apparently by the author and makes it sound like the callback is part of the PHP api. Birthing a new php process to wait for the conf would be horrendous, so I hope they do something else. The author admits to shilling for tips though, so this plugin might not actually exist... "
"You are the one embarrassing yourself. Such a lame attempt at undermining positive news for BCH. You don't even know what to make up :D

You know what? You're running out of ammo. You've got nothing left, and you are getting desperate. The fake Lightning Network news blew in your face, the fake dividends aren't working anymore and you are running scared.

Pathetic. What a sad way to go"
Who is defensive here? These guys are cornered
haha because I made a dumb joke I must be a shill. I support bch more than btc, but wow do both of their subs make it hard. such weird toxic people in both.
"I'm a PHP programmer. PHP _can_ run in an always on context, but is usually relying on cgi-bin or fpm behind a webserver like Apache or nginx and is only run when someone makes a server request, which is WordPress default.

A language like node is always on and can do stuff even when requests aren't coming in.

It's possible to run a check every time a server request is made, but if the site isn't getting traffic then the transaction wouldn't confirm. There are a bunch of ""hacks"" to get around this, a side service, or a cron job, that they might be relying on. Until we see code, we won't know how it works. 

Edit: looks like you're a programmer too (?), so I'm sure you're familiar with much of this."
"> How is it going to be possible to keep up with this kind of volume?

Every action counts. It's all about network effect"
"That would be nice, I would like more ways to get paid :)

Something that would be really interesting would be a plugin that support several cryptocurrencies and let us pick which coins we want to accept in our stores. "
"Your post here is inaccurate, however. WooCommerce isn't ""bringing"" anything to anyone. Any yahoo who knows PHP could write a plugin and put it up on Github. Nothing about that is big news. WooCommerce is NOT officially supporting this plugin, but your title here implies that. "
Your defensive attitude is not helping your point. If you think you’re right, maybe have a conversation. 
"He's saying you control both accounts (\_imba__ and Subalpine) and are creating a fake conversation to discredit his post.

[He's projecting](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79hsfl/ubtcnewsupdates_is_uwilliaminlondon/)."
There are 2 already. gourl.io and coinpayments.net. I use both already.
"> PHP, in a WordPress context, generally isn't always on. 

I'm sorry, but where did you hear this? The entire wordpress platform (including plugins) is written in PHP. That's how it loads dynamic content. "
How is it going to be possible to keep up with this kind of volume? Woocommerce say it's millions of retailers, not 300k... Quite a challenge no?
"Salty and spiteful. As usual.

The article is factually true. To read these lame criticisms from the same people who cheer completely fake rumors of BTC adoption by Amazon or entirely fabricated lies about Lightning Network being production ready is comical."
what? your comment doesn’t make grammatical sense.
When you fork off bitcoin, and call it “bitcoin cash” you just further dilute the crypto market and also confuse people with a similar name.  I just don’t understand it at all. 
not really, whenever there is big news for other coins you see huge gains. something like VEN, NEO .. etc 
[deleted]
it’s like we’re staring in the worlds shittiest fight club reboot. 
"I think ""native"" means ""natively implemented in the plugin"", not platform-native code. 

Such a callback would allow executing code when a transaction is confirmed without contacting a third party service, e.g. to mark an order as paid so operators know it can be shipped out, or digital content delivered automatically. "
Probably that confirmations trigger some code inside of your WooCommerce store and update transactions accordingly
Bitcoin Cash is making major moves!
Very interesting. Will the plugin be free and a fee be applied when used or do we have to pay to get it?
"WooCommerce should probably now be listed on the [bitcoincash.org](https://www.bitcoincash.org) page under ""Services"""
That's a lot!
Thats a pretty big boost !
"> This plugin is seemingly the first which has a native callback for transaction confirmation as well

What does that mean exactly?"
Bruuh, could have waited for BTC and LN to come alive.
👏👏
"https://fudmartng.com is Fudmart NG Store official website and its built with WooCommerce plus we accept BitcoinCash.

We sell Fashion, Home decor, Mobile Phone accessories and offer Free Shipping on all order worldwide."
I'm setting up my shop right now to sell stickers and other fun stuff!
I didn't see any information about launching time. I'm using Woocommerce on my website and so exited about this news.

Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn this is huge!
"> WooCommerce has attracted significant popularity because the base product, in addition to many extensions and plugins, is free and open source. 

> In addition, there are thousands of paid add-ons for fixed prices. Many Premium Themes now offer capability with Woocommerce as well as plugins that make a theme framework compatible.

> Notable WooCommerce extensions include:

> - WooCommerce Bookings: Which allows users to sell blocks of time as appointments.
- WooCommerce Memberships: which allows the user to restrict access to certain parts of their Wordpress website, and sell access to these parts of the website.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WooCommerce"
It's a small point, but should be made clear whether it's WooCommerce that is making the plugin vs. a WooCommerce third-party plugin (having dealt with WooCommerce on plugins, they're pretty particular about their brand)
Woo!
"I can't believe this article was published. Do you see a link to the plugin, because I don't. And such a misleading title.

It links to the Reddit post made yesterday, the post I replied to saying ""that's awesome"", and I tipped the person. I did that because I hope the plugin does actually happen and it's something I'd use and find helpful. But they've published a news article based on a Reddit post as proof?

Sorry to be a party pooper, but some of the reaction to this post is that BCH should be mooning. Sorry but not on the back of this news. Woocommerce is a big project yes, but it's open source on the main, so there are lots and lots of Woo plugins out there. This plugin will be made by a third party developer and may not even make it's way on to the official Woo extensions page. Then, a shop owner is only going to choose to download the BCH plugin, if they've heard of it. And let's be honest with ourselves, how many shops do you know that take BCH? It won't come as standard like the PayPal plugin does.

As I say though, if the plugin does actually exist, or is being built, I wish the developer all the best and it will be useful."
This is a little misleading for people that don’t understand woo-commerce. Someone just wrote a plugin on a platform that supports crypto plugins for checkout, nothing that hasn’t been done before by other cryptos. I’ve written a few for alternative means of payments myself. Has very little impact. It’s really just a step. Woocommerce shops vary a lot by popularity and the fast majority of those stores do little to nothing. If one of the bigger ones decide to buy and use the plugin, well, that will be something to celebrate. 
"somebody wrote a woocommerce plugin? wow incredible

blockstream made a woocommerce plugin for mainnet LN

I know I sound like a troll but the OP is being very dishonest. Anyone can write a WooCommerce plugin, it's an open source eCommerce platform. It's basically Wordpress."
Notice how OP was defending the article throughout the thread, but the moment a technical question related to the article came up they were suddenly silent?
This type of news should have sent BCH skyrocketing. I wonder why not. 
How do you standardize something as a currency when nodes will just keep forking?  Bitcoin cash is an argument against decentralized currency in the context of global e-commerce
The article said in a day or two.
Thanks, this is awesome :)
Thanks for that, we missed that but we'll pass it on!

Every time some even slightly positive news comes, there always has to be one guy going ""yuuuuuge!!1!"". 

As the follow up comment said, this has already been happening for some time and while this new development is good, it certainly in't yuuuuuge.

I want BCH to succeed as much as other people here, but attempts at unbased shilling and pumps are not helping."
This sub is so desperate for moon news, anything goes..
"Really? It's just a news article about a Reddit post from yesterday.

You've been able to accept 0 conf BCH on WooCommerce through www.gourl.io for ages.

This new plugin just adds an API for confirmations."

"**WooCommerce**

WooCommerce is an open source e-commerce plugin for WordPress. It is designed for small to large-sized online merchants using WordPress. Launched on September 27, 2011, the plugin quickly became popular for its simplicity to install and customize and free base product.

"Someone posted on this sub sometime yesterday saying they were the creator (sorry for no link, on mobile). It's definitely 3rd party, and I'm not sure if his API or server is open source. The plugin is, but that doesn't mean much.

But you are completely downplaying this.

I have a woocommerce backed store, and its the most popular way to make payments on wordpress. 

My store has options to use Credit Card, BTC(unfortunately its one of those auto USD), and Amazon(My most popular).

Sure people won't use it because its BCH and most people dont own it. (No one ever used my BTC option). But Woocommerce is a giant."
I for one am shocked an un-biased news outlet like newsbtc.com would mislead us like that.
"Thank you very much for this additional information:) 

Sorry for the mistake on the number of retailers, we went by what was written on your wiki. Millions of retailers is amazing, we had no idea!"
What are the odds of this particular plugin making it into the official WooCommerce marketplace? Or would it likely be limited to being on the Wordpress plugin directory as you mentioned?
"Except those extensions you mention are officially supported and listed here:

This BCH extension will not."
