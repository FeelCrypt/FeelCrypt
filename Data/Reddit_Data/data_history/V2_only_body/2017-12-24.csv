Illustrating a point using the historical example of slavery is not comparing btc to slavery. If anything, you bunch of core cucks are enslaved to the idea that bitcoin is fine going the way it is when it isn't. Mass adoption on a global scale is impossible unless the transaction confirmation times are sped up and the fees are reduced to a trivial amount. Oh wait! We have that already, it's called bitcoin cash. 
"No he used slavery as an analogy for bitcoin.

Learn to analogy bro."
"I don't think so, I dumped all my monero earlier after I lost confidence in the dev team's leadership.

Its good technology but its not going anywhere with the current leadership that loves to idolize the bitcoin core team."
Well, the lowest fee is listed as $1, which is also way too high IMHO.
What privacy coin fixes this? 
"The devs are currently trying to fix the fee problem with a temporary solution (which I don't understand but they're pretty good at what they're doing) until the ""real"" fix comes out to keep it usable as a currency."
The upcoming launch of Bulletproofs will also shrink blocksizes, which will help lower fees as well.
Jesus Christ. The fact people like you that are so ignorant of what Bitcoin is and it's purpose are getting involved with Bitcoin to begin with is fucking stupid. You're no different than the idiots spending thousands of dollars with no idea how crpto works.

People continuously reclassify what bitcoin “is for” as it becomes apparent that it’s not good for certain things. Any flaw is just “not what bitcoin is for”
What are you talking about of course bitcoin was meant for all transactions it's supposed to be a currency! 
Going along with you analogy, bitcoin was designed to be a torch, but you use it as a hammer. I guess every problem looks like a nail to you as well. 
You contradict yourself often? 
XMR has an adaptive blocksize though, so the fee should come down (if high fees are due to full blocks)
"Personally I'm really happy with the strides XMR has made in transactional privacy.

But they got to fix scaling problems, the fees are getting silly. Not Bitcoin Core silly, but stupidly expensive nonetheless."
">Also Monero's fees are getting ridiculous too: https://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fees

>$5 median fee!

In part that's due to people using the default fee in the client, which was set when the coin was much cheaper."
Because a lot of them don't know the technology and are just in crypto for the memes
"Because of the terabyte blocksize! Muh decentralisation! /s

They don't care because /r/bitcoin demonize these constantly"
Lol, did you just compare slavery to Bitcoin?
Reddtipbot is the bot for ReddCoin. Never used it before, and it sent me a PM that the syntax is probably wrong, but this is the syntax from the example they give. Hm.

If LN becomes a thing and Bitcoin Cash wants it, it'll be very easy to implement since the dev team isn't full of a bunch of retards.

"Take some time and actually educate yourself. Bitcoin was not intended for small transactions. Yes it's currency but not currency meant for small transactions. The $100 bill is currency but it's not meant to be used to by a single 50¢ candy bar. Neither we're the 500, 1000, or 10000 not bills when they were in circulation. 

Diesel and gasoline are both fuels yet they ahve to very different purposes. You aren't going to but diesel in your Prius. Bitcoin isn't meant to buy a fucking cookie. Same with mining. It's not meant for small time fuck heads to do in their basement. It never was meant to. It was clearly laid out ehas it's purpose was. "

People create slang all the time. Why can't we use slang here? It's easier. BCASH. Short and sweet 
Haha why :)
If you want short and sweet then call it BCH. 
"Specifically they fanboy over Gregory Maxwell, which anyone with any sense would abhor as a person. Its not like they can claim ignorance, they added a dynamic blocksize algorithm because of the btc blocksize debate, so its not like they live in their own bubble of ignorance. Its a matter of principle, if you willingly associate with snakes and even go as far as defending their character, you become an apologist for evil, which is not what I joined the whole crypto movement for.

There's also the issue of fluffypony taking those pics with core shills wearing USAF hats and doing the D for dragons den like its funny or something, I mean seriously wheres the professionalism? They also don't seem to think fees are an issue by claiming its the price of privacy but at the same claiming they are going reduce them in the near future.

The fee problem is basically the fees have to be a static value or your transactions could be linked just by looking at what fee amounts you are sending with your transactions, so they centrally planned a specific fee value with multipliers for low/medium/high priorities. So the price of Monero goes up and suddenly your fees are several dollars each, its not like Monero sees heavy use, the blocks are real small compared to bitcoin yet the transaction sizes are roughly x50 bigger. Its already totally unacceptable fee levels, the only thing you should ever buy with Monero is expensive illegal drugs.

The user experience is still dogshit, even with the GUI wallet they made, I found out the hard way when I wanted to dump all my holdings, I had to wait 2 hours for my wallet client to sync and I wasn't even downloading the blockchain, I was using a remote node. Why I can't make an instant transaction like with exodus wallet I don't even know, its almost 2018, there's no excuse for having a poor user experience. It even crashed when I tried to do a test transaction and I had to resync the whole thing again.

They don't have the solid background in economics big blockers in btc were always known for, you can hardly claim they believe in free markets. The only consistent ideology with Monero is that privacy is important. If that's all they have, personally that does not inspire confidence in me.

At best they are total amateurs who have no idea what they are doing. There's no reason to hedge with altcoins in case bitcoin fails now that the real bitcoin is back, I'm putting my money where my mouth is."
Nope.
"There's a very, very vocal group of Bitcoin (Core) enthusiasts who have a lot of money tied up in Bitcoin. To them, the failings of Bitcoin as a currency don't matter because they're using it as an investment. They will lose a lot of money if more people switch from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Cash so they smear Bitcoin Cash very loudly on the internet.

Their chief complaint is that using ""Bitcoin"" in the name ""Bitcoin Cash"" is deceptive because  people who intend to buy BTC might accidentally buy BCH. Basically that Bitcoin Cash is a scam trying to take advantage of the Bitcoin name. On the other side, BCH advocates argue that they're entitled to use the name because BCH is closer to the ""true"" vision of Bitcoin as laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Check out /r/Bitcoin to see more arguments against BCH, I'm probably not the best source for them. "
"
Bitcoin Cash supporters maintain that the project known as ""Bitcoin Core"" (the original Bitcoin) has gone astray from the values laid out in the original Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin Core is now more useful as a long-term store of value (like gold or real estate) than it is as an everyday currency. The transaction fees to send Bitcoin have skyrocketed into the neighborhood of $20 per transaction (unless you want your transaction to take days to go through, if it even goes through at all). If you're sending millions of dollars internationally that's a pretty small fee compared to what a bank wire would cost you, but if you're trying to buy a pizza or a purchase a game on Steam it's absurdly high.  In the past, the sub-penny fees and near-instant transactions were *the* selling points of Bitcoin, so you can understand why some people feel that Bitcoin has strayed from it's original vision.

Bitcoin Cash is a project that splintered off from the original Bitcoin project and uses much of the same codebase, with some important differences: most notably Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks which keeps fees down and keeps transactions moving quickly.

I'm not as well-versed on the arguments against Bitcoin cash from the opposing side but I do know that they take issue with us using the word ""Bitcoin"" in the name. They call it ""Bcash"" to make it seem unconnected to Bitcoin. Also any post that isn't entirely critical of Bitcoin Cash will be deleted from /r/Bitcoin so /r/BTC is the only place left for uncensored discussion of both projects.

Tldr: the original Bitcoin now only makes sense for investors and rich people looking for a place to stash their money long-term. If you're looking for a decentralized currency that can be used for small everyday purchases by poor or middle-class people all over the world (which was the initial vision for Bitcoin), Bitcoin Cash is the answer."
True, this works in text speech much better.

Read the whitepaper
"Yes you can tip it forward by typing ""/u/tippr [amount]"" in a reply and it will tip that amount to whoever you are replying to.

The fees would still cost more than Bitcoin Cash.
Segwit addresses get a 75% discount on only the signature portion of the bytes. Even if the *entire* transaction was 75% off, that would still be outrageously expensive.
LOL. The r/bitcoin community, maybe.
lol, it’s becauae they’re crying.
Except it's not.
Bitcoin wasn't meant for small transactions. So Bitcoin cash isn't Superior its an entirely different tool for an entirely different job. You would say a torch is far superior to a hammer if you are trying to build a birdhouse.  
It's not Superior. Did you never read what the purpose of Bitcoin was? It's not for small transactions, it's not meant for the average person to use, or for them to mine. It's for large transactions and to be farmed by large server banks. Never ever was meant for the low time loser. 
There's a lot you can't do with your Bitcoin Core tokens.
"Also Monero's fees are getting ridiculous too: https://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fees

$5 median fee!"
They think it can work like gold, but forget that gold had value as a building material. 
exactly! the only thing that mystifies me is why diehards won't recognize that Bitcoin is having major scaling problems?
Thats what i was afraid of
Same with me. I heard lightning might not even be coming. I like ETH and BCH
Ok, you keep telling yourself that
"Your logic is totally lacking in logic. BcH represents progress. That's like saying there would be no America the way it is today had we not relied upon free slave labour from blacks and Asians. Slavery: it built our nation and further refined our nation through the civil war. Show some respect!

EDIT: this is an analogy. Just because bch was built from and forked from core doesn't mean I respect or like core. I find the core team deplorable, much like I find the early slave drivers who literally built America deplorable.

Btc core is unusable. 75% of the world lives in poverty by America's standards. No one can buy $50 of groceries and have an additional $35 fee slapped on. It's ridiculous and outrageous"

So that's a hard pass on DOING anything, and a continuation of bitching without merit. Troll on.
"At least in traditional applications what you have when you try to verticalize is that eventually you hit a cost wall because your volume increased faster than costs have come down. For instance, the application I'm working on saw a 5x increase in volume since last year, and hardware costs have actually come up a little in my country since then. But our application is distributed and adding 5x more instances is way cheaper than buying a single machine that can transact 5x more.

Cost doesn't increase linearly with capacity increase. Let's say you have a tradicional SQL based app. The system is centralized and can process 10tps. You buy a bigger machine for 2x the price that gives you double the capacity. Then you try to double that again, but now you have an 1.5x increase. Eventually you'll end up with a machine that costs you a couple of millions and all you have is 100tps.

Now, going back to your question, eventually the blocksize hit a wall that makes it very expensive for most machines trying to process a block, because for any successful business out there, the user base and volume usually grows at a way faster rate than hardware costs go down. Home users can't just double their bandwidth contract every few months, it usually take years for most people to see an increase, while miners and mining pools can because they're getting paid and can afford it. 

Of course, that's no excuse to keep the limit so low today. "

Those running full nodes presumably have some skin in the game, and are doing it to verify the blockchain for themselves, while also helping out the network a bit. There is a broader issue that there is little incentive to run a ""full node"" besides to help yourself.

However, all miners also take on the role of a full node, right? Or is that wrong? My thinking is that once you've mined a block, it obviously benefits you to propagate that block to the network quickly.

[One correction with what I said. This is a pretty embarrassing oversight on my part, but a fast exponential divided by a slow exponential gives you a slow exponential, not a constant. However there is another factor - if the *price* keeps going up exponentially, then you have exponentially more justification to want to verify the blockchain for yourself. However, I don't like that this is dependent on price appreciation. Any thoughts?

>Of course, that's no excuse to keep the limit so low today.

I continue to be blown away by your kindness in your responses on reddit. You treat everyone with humility and respect. Thank you for being a role model for the philanthropic and Bitcoin community! Don’t ever let your gobs and gobs of BTC go to your head. :)

Mostly deliberate rent-seeking. Have you seen the transaction fees now? And can you imagine the transaction fees they will charge to use their lightning network?

"There were a lot of precursors to Bitcoin architecture, but no one got it right until Satoshi. 

>we should follow his paper down to the T? 

No, the point is people are assuming this ""full nodes keep Bitcoin decentralized"" nonsense was part of the original design, so they accept it uncritically. If they knew the system had been totally, fundamentally changed from the original design they might start pulling on that thread. Once you start pulling, the whole Core mythology unravels like a poorly knit sweater.

"With all due respect, Nick Szabo's approach relied on a byzantine public registry which was vulnerable to Sybil attacks. So, we know that on at least one occasion Satoshi Nakamoto outsmarted Szabo, why not on this?

"Bitcoin Cash supporters don't oppose second layer solutions as such. We just oppose ruining the main chain. It makes the network and its users more vulnerable to takeovers, including subtle but effective government interference.

"> Yes, satoshi was around for the very beginning of development and was not around to update his views when it became clear mining became centralized.

You are parroting a cheap, nasty propaganda lie.


You might have not foreseen the move to specialized hardware, but to anyone with half a brain, it was *quite* clear that people will move to specialized HW. The economic reasons for this is absolutely crystal clear.

What is the chance that Satoshi understands human behavior and economics so well to design the incentive system BUT not understand a very simple move to more efficient hardware?

And you don't even need to speculate. Satoshi said himself on this:

>  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to
specialists with server farms of **specialized hardware.**

It was actually one of my personal measurement points back then for Bitcoin's general success when I still just lurked around: ""Hey, if they really start to do ASICs for this, that means that this will win."".

In any case, what do I even talk to you here. If you believe BTC is ""muh digital gold"", keep on HODLing it and be happy."
">Yes, satoshi was around for the very beginning of development and was not around to update his views when it became clear mining became centralized.

That problem is not solved by restricting block size, which is the subject matter of this post."
"Did you really expect him or anyone with half a brain to believe we would be mining with raspberry pies today?

That's just absurd.  What you mean by centralized really mean professionalized."
">At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

You struggle with reading comprehension don’t you?

Satoshi explicitly says he expects mining to centralize into dedicated server farms. It’s already accounted for in his original design."
"Funny you said that, ETH that process more tx than BTC and got a larger blockchain yet got massively more nodes.

All that indicate small blocks increase centralisation by pricing out incentives to run a node.

Why run a node for a network you don’t even use?"
Satoshi was aware of the possibility of FGPAs and ASICs as early as April, 2009 at least. ([source](https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4))

Decentralization comes from competition of many entrants, which comes with Bitcoin mining being so profitable that many diverse interests rush to participate. This can obviously only happen with massive adoption, which requires massive scaling.
Mining it's completely decentralized, dunno where you've got a different idea.

Oops, sorry, you are correct, he said 100GB=2HD.
"Yes, my mistake was not putting 100GB/day, i wrote 2.4GB/day. In average we have 144 blocks/day, so that's exactly your calculation ~ 695 MB/10 min, it would require only ~ 1.16 MB/s, which is ~ 10Mbps internet plan (well, 15+Mbps due to ISP inefficiencies).

That's like 40 usd / month plan in world average? I pay roughly this for 60Mbps cable internet."

"If Satoshi thought he had all the solutions and if he believed this project should only proceed according to his ""original vision"" he would've done the following:
A. He wouldn't have made this thing open source to minimize divergence from his original plan
B. He would've stuck around and forced his opinion down everyone's throats
C. Hell with it, he wouldn't even have designed it to be decentralized, he would've just made it another paypall type company with him as the CEO to guide the ""original plan""

He didn't do any of that to de-emphasize the original plan and leave room for evolution and growth.

That being said I personally believe BCH to be closer to the 2012-14 bitcoin. I am supporter of the direction it is going. But that shouldn't stop any group of people pursuing their vision of bitcoin. The ""original vision"" is exactly this; us figuring out which and however many ways to go with this thing.

well, if i understand you correctly, it was indeed just one pool in that Unknown group.  which further emphasizes and supports my main point that mining was way more centralized then than now.
"If it's trivial to get to 300tps, why is Ethereum starting to hit its scaling limit at 27tps equivalent?

Here is my math:

8,000,000 gas limit per block right now. Normal non-smart transaction costs 21,000 gas. That means 8M/21K = 380tx/block. 1 block every 14 sec means 380/14 = 27tx/sec that Ethereum could do right at this moment if there were no smart contract transactions.

Ethereum already has an increasing uncle rate; the equivalent in Bitcoin would be a rise in orphaned blocks due to propagation time.

[According to Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/31/uncle-rate-transaction-fee-analysis/), scalability on the main chain is very limited from this point on:

> There is a limit to how much scalability is possible on a single chain, with the primary bottleneck being disk reads and writes, so after some point (likely 10-40 million gas) sharding will be the only way to process more transactions.

Even 40 million gas is still only 136tx/sec. Is that because Ethereum's disk access pattern is more inefficient than Bitcoin's? Maybe, but I find it hard to believe.

~~I'm about to ask in the /r/ethereum subreddit whether there is an Ethereum equivalent of xthin/compact blocks, and whether it is already implemented or in the works.~~ Found [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/618lat/does_ethereum_use_some_type_of_implementation_of/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5zpnk6/does_ethereum_have_an_equivalent_of_bitcoins/), devs get onnit pls thx"
"> this idea that mined blockchains don't scale only comes from the weird notion that non-mining nodes have anything to do with the security of the system, a notion that has clearly also infected Ethereum

I haven't heard anywhere that Ethereum devs believe that non-mining nodes are important. In fact I remember one of them iirc saying that Ethereum would be fine if there were only 100 full nodes in the world."
Agreed. The white paper should not be the only truth. My point was the arguments against increasing the block size are usually pretty weak or non existent. At least IMHO
No single pool had 80% though. They were all under 20% with the exception of DeepBit. I don't follow.

"I can't speak for Ethereum but suffice to say that years of optimizations on Bitcoin didn't get done.

For example the Core devs sat on compact blocks until after Bitcoin Unlimited released xthin.

"Their block rate is really fast, so it makes sense there are many uncles. Also, quite possible their whole virtual computer thing is a lot more hardware intensive. I've never heard anyone say that read/write speed is any kind of bottleneck in Bitcoin, so that could be something novel.

so you think mining is more centralized today?  i don't due to the magnitude of additional investments that have gone into mining since then from all over the world.

Not ""almost as if"", that's literally what's happening."
"> Their block rate is really fast, so it makes sense there are many uncles.

They would run into issues even without any smart-contract transactions in their blocks.

Not sure how I would speak to your uncle point though, as I am not super familiar with how the economics of it work out. If they moved to a 10min block time, maybe they would reduce the uncle problem. I'm not sure."
"> They are uber-rich mofos at this point, so their machines and networking must be formidable, in the $100k range at least for the servers and ultra fast industrial broadband. They are really having trouble even with that?

Yes apparently, according to Vitalik. Does that mean that Ethereum is inefficiently designed? Like, are the core devs totally missing some obvious optimizations?

I heard them talking about stateless clients in one of the dev meetings, maybe that will help resolve the bottleneck by reducing the disk read/write bottleneck.

Sorry for derailing this thread into Ethereum, I am just trying to figure out why Ethereum is running into upcoming scaling issues even with normal non-smart transactions, but Bitcoin (Cash) wouldn't."

"> There are certainly more active miners today than there were back then, both then and now I think mining is adequately decentralized.

The exception is the one thing that matters here. 5 miners with 20% each is far more decentralized (in the only important sense: *immunity to attack*) than 1 miner with 80% and 100 miners with 0.2% each.

No, I am merely suggesting that Satoshi's security assumptions for bitcoin included many use or alerts or fraud proofs and without those we need to be very careful and encourage decentralized validation . Every aspect to the whitepaper must be individually analyzed and taken into context , including all work thereafter since this is a open source project that adapts with new information
What evidence do you have that simply increasing the block size without doing anything else could not get to visa-scale? It seems perfectly possible with modest equipment.

Yep. FTL communication is equivalent to time travel. If you can communicate faster than light at all, there *is* a legitimate frame of reference from which that communication is received before it’s transmitted.
"**No-communication theorem**

In physics, the no-communication theorem is a no-go theorem from quantum information theory which states that, during measurement of an entangled quantum state, it is not possible for one observer, by making a measurement of a subsystem of the total state, to communicate information to another observer. The theorem is important because, in quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement is an effect by which certain widely separated events can be correlated in ways that suggest the possibility of instantaneous communication. The no-communication theorem gives conditions under which such transfer of information between two observers is impossible. These results can be applied to understand the so-called paradoxes in quantum mechanics, such as the EPR paradox, or violations of local realism obtained in tests of Bell's theorem.

"We can go far beyond Visa just by increasing blocksize. Did you see the recent terabyte blocks article?

In any case, this idea that mined blockchains don't scale only comes from the weird notion that non-mining nodes have anything to do with the security of the system, a notion that has clearly also infected Ethereum. It looks like effectively all the altcoins are based on Core's idea there. 

Only BCH is based on Satoshi's vision, where the network is *only* a network of miners. Everyone else just watches from the sidelines; they don't ""participate."" If you wanna play (in the hashvoting=validation process), you gotta pay. No one gets a say for free. Not a democracy, a hashocracy. No vote without investment (anything else is the very definition of a Sybil attack!). 

There is no role for non-mining ""nodes"" (a silly name when they aren't even participating in the Nakamoto-consensus-process network) in relaying for, validating blocks for, securing, or decentralizing the mining network, which becomes obvious when you consider the mining network topology that arises from the incentives on miners, namely to prioritize network resources to connecting to nodes proportionally with their demonstrated hashpower. That means connections to nodes with zero demonstrated hashpower are of minimal or no priority. The network systematically cuts the sockpuppet miners (Core's darling ""full nodes"") out of the loop, as they (and their uber-inefficient mesh-network topology) are deadweight on the mining network, like shriveled leaves on a vine. Miners connect to each other in a nearly direct all-to-all topology, called a ""nearly complete graph"" or ""small-world network."" 

It is many orders of magnitude faster and harder to attack. Core and apparently Ethereum and many other altcoins have been trying to compete in NASCAR with their emergency brake engaged. Bitcoin Cash is going to blow their doors off."

"So I have to disagree here. My understanding is that the scale ceiling is the planet earth & her satellites. Basically within about 10 light minutes of Earth. Once your communication lag gets much longer than the block time it's a pretty poor user experience. 

Unless we figure out faster than light communication. Maybe we should add that to the development plan? 

We probably need off chain solutions when we become a multi planet species. So Bitcoin Cash Mars? 

Good problems to have :)"

Man this community is awesome thank you :). I need to look into tippr and how it works, to spread the love around too.
Sounds like you're taking a lot of liberties with what Satoshi was thinking. I agree with you to an extent but there is no way he could of predicted or known the modern Bitcoin situation. It all comes down to what is the smartest, most efficient way to scale Bitcoin with everything we know today

"Not quite true. Raising the block size will work great for a few years but then we will need a new solution for continuing to scale up.

See Ethereum, which is beginning to hit the technical limits for what a traditional blockchain can handle. They still have some headroom and some optimization to do within the current paradigm, but I can guarantee you they aren't going to do 100x as many transactions as today before finishing one of the many scaling solutions they are working on."
If we are going to sticky it, a more comprehensive explanation of Satoshi's original design (based around his words) would be nice. (See my recent comment history for some ideas in that direction.)
"Think about steam. Gta, the witcher and many other games are 60gb+ and sell like water in desert. Connection speed is evolving fast.

Satoshi had good foresight. I mean even today sending 2 HD movies per day is perfectly feasible for a lot of people with home broadband and we aren't even remotely near the amount of transactions needed for that.
"**Creating a problem so they can provide the solution**

There's already a solution for cheap microtransactions - debit cards.
The plan also included mining decentralization which you did not follow!
I believe he was saying 2 HD movies is 100GB, which is still accurate if you're talking about remuxes.
"You forgot tabs; they are clearly the solution to all our problems.

"He says 100GB per day right in the quote, and ""in a few years."" That's 700MB per ten minutes, and we're also well beyond ""a few years."" Gigablocks by 2018 seems like a reasonable, even conservative interpretation of his view."

This is simply a problem with the wallets being used. 1 satoshi fee transactions get included in the next block with BCH right now. These current fees people talk about of even a few cents are because the wallet designers are mostly forked from old bitcoin core wallets that had fees calculated to be expected in the nearest block. This is mostly unnecessary in BCH since the mempool gets cleared every block right now.
BCH is still way too conservative, but this is understandable as development is just getting started. Mostly the 1-cent fees are just wallets being silly anyway, and 32MB in May will bring that down even further. Anything less than a tenth of a cent can be called free for most current purposes, but I think the ultimate design can sustain something like less than 1/100 of a cent fees for most txs.
A few mining teams should be putting some miners and nodes on GB links, we can surely scale then.  Its time we put the mining profits to good use
BCH will eventually have bigger blocks and higher adoption and hopefully revert back towards free transactions.

Satoshi invented payment channels though so that is clearly inline with Bitcoins direction
It's an important perspective (and his thoughts here are very valuable), but Satoshi couldn't predict the entire developmental process of cryptocurrencies: this is an industry in its infancy. There will be many ideas (both good and bad) that will spawn from his single white paper. Those which the market prefers (and are best supported by existing infrastructure, to help transition to a digital market) will be adopted most broadly, and become dominant in the world economy. We are all minor players in that process, without a doubt. 
"Any time people come later, screw a system up, and manage to distract everyone from the original design or concept, the original dude will seem like a time traveller just because they didn't make those errors.

"Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.

The problem with /r/btc is that “they” are not willing to actually talk about improving BTC. Instead, they’ve bought into an alt-coin which they believe is Bitcoin. BCH is centralized. It may be useful, but it isn’t Bitcoin. You should all move over to /r/bch
I feel like this is the biggest mystery in computer science. He/they left the world with a complete solution for one of the biggest problems in CS, and didn't even rip and fruits but by the satisfaction of having it solved.
"I find it odd that every person in here is agreeing that ""the system never hits a scale ceiling"", but yet is fighting tooth and nail for more scale? 

The original intention if I'm not mistaken was that this was a ""decentralized"" form of currency, which means that if you're using it, you should be setting up a node for your wallet. This would reduce the need for a block size *at all*, thus reducing major issues with time/cost of transactions. "

The more I read/think about bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoton, it seems likely this was all done by an AI or powerful group. That or a modern day Nikola Tesla, the whole idea is thought out pretty dam solid.
things evolve. you think wright brothers envisioned planes would be as they are today?
"We are in the era of HD movies easily sent back and forth. Actually, HD movies in 2008 were quite a different thing, something like 1.2 gig, so I assume satoshi is saying that sending 2.4 gig in one day won't be a big deal, as it isn't at all now.

edit: my mistake, satoshi said 100GB=2HD movies;"
And with thin blocks, there is no need to transmit the transaction twice, so now it’s even less of a problem than Satoshi said. 
"What would the size of the blockchain grow to? You have to remember this was said during a peak in moore's law. Computational power was doubling every 18 months.

Since then moore's law has been collapsing. Computational power and storage capacity isn't growing at the same rate as it was in 2009. Processor speed, as well as storage capacity growth has been slowing as we reach the limits of our manufacturing ability.

If large block only blockhain saw mass adoption, the blockchain would grow exponentially, but our technology for processing and storage isn't.

Your assertions that tech is getting faster and cheaper is just plain incorrect. CPU speeds are hitting walls, storage capacity isn't growing much, memory prices have doubled in the last year alone. The average persons internet access speed isn't growing very quickly at all. Sure more people have access to high bandwidth now, but those who already have high bandwidth connections aren't seeing a doubling in speed year over year. Yet alone increases that would be needed for a massive blockchain. Moore's law that was applicable when this was wrote, is now dead. 

If large block blockchain gained global acceptance, the blockchain would grow so large that only those with access to very powerful systems would be able to handle it. It's global usage would force centralization, which is its whole value in the first place, decentralization."
I think this should be stickied. It's tiresome to explain to every single Core fanboy why we prefer the original vision.

Read more Satoshi and you'll find this is accurate. Actually no, Satoshi was even *more* radically different than Core than OP suggests.
"Point is, we never ran into any empirical issues with his design (we did with Core's jonny-come-lately design), yet now practically everyone - big blocker or small - has this idea that the original design had non-mining nodes operating as some kind of defender of decentralization and security. This notion is immediately shut down by reading Satoshi. 

This puts the ""full node"" ideology in a very different light: it's demonstrably something added to Bitcoin after Satoshi left, a fundamental change pioneered by mostly the same people who stand to profit massively from the change. 

High fee coin is a dumb idea, but it is crucial to understand that it wasn't the original idea. Bitcoin Cash is the only one that follows Satoshi's vision, the one everyone who read the whitepaper should have known they were investing in. 


You can say we are wrong, but after reading Satoshi you can't credibly say we aren't trying to restore the original Bitcoin vision."

I think Satoshi clearly saw Bitcoin as a product intended for everyday use and designed it as such. I don't think a lot of Bitcoin Core devs see it that way anymore, unfortunately.
His ideas were empirically proven to work
Awesome point. I also want to add bitcoin evolving via segwit and lightning. Its one thing to move forward that will benefit the community via bigger blocks, side projects ect, its another to complete complicate things and try to offer a product that has nothing to do with the present issues for ulterior motives (seg/lightning) Satoshi knew what he was doing and how bitcoin should work. He had the plan laid out to follow. If bitcoin was to be taken over, it had to he from within.

"That’s assuming there will eventually be *zero* people willing to host a node.

Total Nodes might decrease, but there will always be people willing to run nodes up to a point. The majority of people aren’t running on a Raspberry Pi connected via Dialup.

As for me personally, I’m willing to run a node up until blocks are about 10-15Mb. That’s what I can spare *right now*. In 5 or so years, I’m sure I’ll be willing to support much larger blocks than that.

Increasing blocksize to 2Mb shouldn’t affect a noticeable amount of nodes at all. (Nobody should expect to run the same hardware for 7+ years without *any* upgrades, anyways)

Now, what *does* decrease the node count is when Bitcoin itself becomes unusable for anything other than as a store of value. People will start realizing they don’t need their node online, as they aren’t spending anything and aren’t verifying their own transactions. If they’re just holding because the price will go up, they won’t bother contributing to the network."
Yeah the other side is SO BRAINWASHED.
Doesn’t having fewer nodes and more dedicated servers lead to network centralization? Serious question not trolling

The nodes aren't the problem, they're cheap. Mining is the far bigger issue, and Core didn't do jack shit about it.
"By ""nodes"" Satoshi generally meant ""miners."" There haven't been fewer miners as blocksize has grown, but in fact the opposite. Mining has become significantly *more* decentralized, and the reason is obvious: as Bitcoin gets adopted (hinging on its capacity!), the price increases and more diverse interests start getting into mining. When we are hitting gigablocks, there will probably be thousands of mining pools with no single pool having nearly as much hashrate as a major pool today. 

Thus we have bigger servers needed yet more total. Paradox? No, because the entire pie is much bigger.

Also, miners can just switch pools if the pool doesn't do what they want. Any time you start thinking of decentralization as measuring something other than immunity to attack, you've gone off the rails. ""Full nodes"" that do not mine have nothing whatsoever to do with decentralization. "

Institutions can act as users of the system and participate just as individuals do. The system itself does not depend on centralized institutions.
The only issue I see with using crypto currency day to day is the volatile nature of it's worth. It has no inherent value, as it stand therefore it's worth is worth what its conversion is worth. I have a Chinese delivery place near me that accept Bitcoin for example. However, if I bought it in Bitcoin, I might spend $20 worth of bitcoin. Tomorrow, however, that $20 could now be $10. Or $40. Or maybe even $100. So long as cryptocurrency continues to fluctuate so sporadically, I can't imagine it can be used in day-to-day activities. Not without accepting a fair amount of risk from both parties, anyhow.
Actually the tools used to upload the white paper, the tools to download and the WikiLeaks cablegate backup were all uploaded on the same day in April 2013. I worked on some tools to download the data from a local node through the JSON-RPC connection found [here.](https://github.com/TrustyJAID/Blockchain-downloader) What you could also do is go to just about any block explorer site and find a way to view the raw data then for each output remove the first 8 characters or 4 bytes of data (because it's hex encoded) convert them from hex to ascii (binary data) then change the text file to a pdf. The guy who's running cryptograffiti.info said he was going to work on adding this capability sometime soon now that I showed him how it's stored using a length and checksum to verify the document. It would work a lot nicer with the tools to do it pragmatically.

Miners = decentralization. "
It doesn't go too deeply into the mathematics behind it. It's a high level overview that is manageable for a layman to understand. But I had to read it several times before I really grokked it all. 
"I found [B-money - Wei Dai](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) (one of the references) helpful for understanding how the system is supposed to work.

I did have a bit of a CS background though (so has no trouble with the terms used). As BejingBitcoins said, it is not a highly technical piece. "
But in Bitcoin, no one is forcing you to use an institution. And no one can stop you from opening a company. It's a free enterprise system. 
">**Decentralized** miners = decentralization

FTFY. If one entity employs or owns all the miners, it's not decentralized."
It's beyond that. The original client had no block size consensus rule. The inclusion of the rule was a temporary measure that was always expected to be removed. Bitcoin (Cash) needs no consensus block size rule.
"Ohkay, so I've been reading and I'm still lost.
But, this is kinda what I think I'm gathering.
Is this basically money that the government isn't regulating? It seems like this is money that has value simply because the community allows it to have value.
Also, and please please correct me if I'm wrong, does this mean that not one single power is in control? Because that would be insane but seems really impossible. Especially that last bit. Is it saying that it goes to some type of a voting system where members decide how much money gets ""printed"" instead of just running the ""press"" day and night?

Edit: And holy crap, this is international? "
Yes it is. Decentralization has nothing to do with hashpower. Miners are selfish, will mine whatever's most profitable. Source: Am miner.
"I don't know that I agree with that. Obviously it should be significantly more than what's nessecary to keep fees low, but it is a good safety measure against an excessively large block. Obviously there's other factors that prevent that, but I think a system like emergent consensus (what BCH uses, originally created by BU) is the best compromise.

The original client did have a max block size, albeit not explicitly. The 32MB message send limit dictated this, and still carries on into BCH. Technically, BCH's max block size is 32MB, but it's limited to 8MB by miner and full-node votes at 8MB, but should a larger block be mined, assuming a majority of miners accept it, existing clients voting for a smaller block size will accept it after an acceptance depth (AD) is reached. AFAIK only BU uses acceptance depth in their client, because it's fairly complicated to implement."
"Your summary is mostly correct.

It took solving at least two open computing science problems (byzantine generals problem and partially invalidating the CAP theorem). Until I read that paper, I did not think money issue without government backing was even really possible. To be honest, I still did not think it would work until about a year later when [an open offer to buy pizza for 10,000BTC](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0) established a floor price.

At it's most basic, Bitcoin is a distributed, append-only ledger. To pay somebody, you publicly sign over your ""coins"" to either the hash of their public key, or the hash of their redeem script. The latter is how segwit transactions work: it uses a special redeem script with new rules.

Edit: Bitcoin uses a fixed inflation schedule that tapers off at about 21 million bitcoin issued by sometime next century."
I'm not commenting on hashpower at all. If one company *employs* a majority of the miners, or otherwise owns a majority of the mining *nodes*, decentralization would be questionable.
How do you mean? 
"Thank you for the reply. I would've responded earlier, but I had to look up some the word you used:
Byzantine, CAP Theorem, Append-only Ledger(Still confused), Hash, Segwit, Blockchain.

So, essentially people can't be trusted so there's a lot of safety precautions to ensure no one takes advantage. Also, the hash is like a simplified password, or address of sorts? The CAP theorem doesn't make me feel too great, which is why there's a ton of different people and a ton of safety precautions, yeah? Also, it looks like it's extremely careful about tracking all of the transactions so that people can't spend the same money twice. 
Am I going in the right direction here, or is my frantic floundering the only thing keeping me from drowning in it?"

"A few things to be careful of when reading:

- Keep track of context. Some statements might seem to contradict each other, like when it says at the very end that any needed rule changes can be made through hashpower voting whereas he says earlier, ""This does not throw open the system to arbitrary changes."" In context there is no contradiction: ""This"" refers to a malicious miner having the majority of hashpower, and ""arbitrary changes"" refers to, as it says in the next part of the sentence, stealing coins or mining extra coins. All Satoshi is saying here is that a 51% attack cannot steal coins or create inflation, but ""only"" undo confirmed transactions the miner has sent. Still a very damaging and potentially fatal attack, but he is just noting it not quite as bad as you might think. It has nothing to do with how the rules are decided. 

- When Satoshi says ""node"" he almost exclusively means ""miner.""

- Read the many comments in the original release code and associated files such as the [readme.txt](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/readme.txt) where he clearly says if you are not mining you are not contributing to the network. Bitcoin is a mining network. Nodes that don't mine are only nodes in that they could one day decide to mine; they're essentially dormant nodes, fake miners, Sybil miners. They play a role only for users needing a few perks like faster confirmation certainty and 0-confirmation transaction acceptance, not for network security nor for decentralization.

- Most importantly, read Section 8: Simplified Payment Verification very carefully and in context with the rest of the paper. Note well that the phrase [""overpowered by an attacker""](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-243.5-243.360) there refers refers to a minority hashpower attacker who finds a few lucky blocks in a row, not a majority attacker, as this changes the entire meaning of the section because it suggests SPV requires fraud proofs to work,  which changes the entire model of the system: until we have these fraud proofs we have to have ultra-tiny blocks, and we don't have them yet. But this is completely backwards. Fraud proofs are merely mentioned as a ""nice to have"" and are certainly never mentioned as essential for decentralization or security of the system as a whole. This is the very heart of Core's error. (Check my comment history for more details.)

The language gets confused just because in the beginning he could use the term ""node"" interchangeably to refer to mining nodes and non-mining clients, since most users would be mining at first, as per his first answer on the mailing list. This was never the intended configuration at scale.

Non-mining nodes don't support the network. They contribute nothing to security of the network as a whole nor to decentralization, and they cannot defend you against doublespending attacks, which are far worse than mining extra coinbase rewards since they use perfectly valid blocks. For this same reason, a non-mining node cannot defend against a hashpower majority who wants to change the rules - the majority can just doublespend your chain into oblivion even if you can get a sizable minority to mine on it.

Non-mining nodes also cannot exert a significant influence on the network, such as through supposed ""user-activated forks,"" because the mining network mainly doesn't relay through non-mining nodes: it's an all-to-all topology among all the significant mining pools, a nearly complete graph rather than a mesh network. Think what a terrible system it would be if just running a piece of software and not investing any hashpower could affect network consensus! If that were true, running a large number of these non-hashing clients would be a form of Sybil attack. Yet this is what Core developers are pushing for.

They further build on their faulty model by including non-mining nodes in the network and thus thinking it is a mesh network, when Bitcoin is actually a mining network. That is the network described in the whitepaper. The software was originally set up so that miners automatically prioritize connections to the most productive other miners over the least productive - and the very least for non-mining nodes after they demonstrate they never end up mining any blocks. In this way the network ""learns"" to route around the non-mining nodes and leave them to listen from the sidelines. It is routing around the deadweight of fake miners (incongruously called ""full nodes"").

Bitcoin is decentralized by competitive mining incentives, not warm bodies running non-mining nodes.

Non-mining nodes are only useful for merchants who want very high security a few minutes earlier than with SPV or want to accept zero-confirmation transactions, as it says at the end of Section 8.

- Read all of Satoshi's comments for even more context. This is crucial because of how much the people that came later corrupted the system. It is most certainly NOT a matter of ""we've learned more since Satoshi,"" any more than Keynesian economists had ""learned more since Adam Smith."""

Currently in process of translating the white paper and the Bitcoincash.org to Hungarian yay. If there are people out there that have the time to translate these to other languages I think it would help a lot so that we can reach a global audience.
"Ohkay, but for those of who aren't tech savvy, and don't understand simple concepts or basic computer stuff what does it mean?

Also, for someone such as this is it even worth trying to jump on this train?

Hypothetically, let's say a user read all 8ish pages (not the end stuff [Sources?]) and didn't understand most of it. Then let's pretend they reread it and somehow understood it less. Would that person even have any chance of getting in on this?"

"I agree for people who are involved enough to visit this subreddit.  I'm worried mass adoption will always be stunted if this is a prerequisite.  

If we should be focusing on anything, it should be moving towards a more stable and user-friendly environment where people who don't understand cryptography can participate in.

I always think about this every time I read a comment about it being an end-users fault they lost their private key or life savings."
"I'm pretty new to this whole crypto thing. I'd like to get a wallet but I don't know where I should get it from or if I should just generate my own. A lot of the stuff I read I read over on /r/bitcoin and a lot of it I know just isn't true or was true at one point but isn't any more. The fee thing really put a bad taste in my mouth. The officially bitcoin site said fee's were cheap but I know for a fact they aren't.

 So where should I open a wallet if I want to use it? Can I only buy from certain places if I have a wallet on a specific site? How much money should I put in my wallet? "

"what are some other whitepapers to read? (I mean each crypto seems to have a whitepaper associated with it explaining a lot of their unique ideas, so that's some reading, but only so many are novel concepts I guess)

I saw a listing here that seemed decent: http://startupmanagement.org/2014/12/16/the-ultimate-list-of-bitcoin-and-blockchain-white-papers/"
The first paragraph tells you that it is peer to peer transactions and NO institutions are involved like coinbase/gemini/banks. 
"This should be stickied.

Paging u/memorydealers "
Uhm, I still have a question after reading the abstract: where is the network and who works on all the nodes? 
"The most important document in the history of mankind. USA Constitution moved to a second place

Nothing secures life, liberty, property and pursuit of happiness of an individual as good as economic freedom based on the combination of greed and math"
Read with care the paragraph about forks (different blocks), it's about the democratic process of making changes in Bitcoin, and the need for a consensus before a hard fork. To me this is the most important part, even if it makes it longer to fix the issues.
Shocking document that will increase your wealth that Bitcoin core do not want you to know about.
So is this like the Old Testament for Bitcoin Cash? Who’s writing the New Testament?
This document may well be one of the most cited and read in the history of man by the time this is all done.
Should be stickied.
I would also recommend everyone read the LN white paper as well. After reading it myself I just don't see how it could ever work.
"I agree on the amazing white paper that started this whole new era.  It is incredible.   

I am not saying this in defense or core or as an attack against bitcoin cash, but it is extremely short sided to point to a 10 year old design to prove an argument one way or another.   

Those that believe bitcoin must be used for daily peer to peer transactions have been heard by forking off with a solution they deem safe and secure and achieves the original intent.   Why must we continue to argue day and day out .   

At this point, sad as it is,  neither bitcoin or bitcoin cash are the leading software or best tech for achieving scalable txns.   This incessant fighting will inevitably destroy both sides and enable a competitor to take over.
 
As of now,  there isn’t even a demand for a high volume of txns other than speculators lookin to get rich.   If there was a demand, why don’t we see more usage of bitcoin cash.   looks like bitcoin is seeing 10 times the activity as cash.   

All said, i love the underlying tech more than the practical use case for my personal life.  I get it has value for many different people in many different applications.    I just wish this fighting would stop.    both forums are 90% about bashing or attempting to defame the other side in some way.

Referencing satoshis original intent doesn’t accomplish much.   If the main goal is to create software that can achieve what you want, haven’t you succeeded?   The only reason i can think of to become the original / real bitcoin is to increase the worth of your investment.   If increasing ones wealth was satoshis main goal,  core is achieving that.

If the 99.99% of users who have never turned a mining wallet on didnt contribute the network wouldnt be even nearly what it is for the miners, not to mention the very undemocratic decisions made by corporate boards of directors well outside the bounds of hashing power decisions.
how can I read the whitepaper on the blockchain?

>Can I only buy from certain places if I have a wallet on a specific site?

A good bitcoin wallet won't depend on being hosted on a specific site (Blockchain.info is an exception, because everything is done client-side and you can make a backup in case something happens to the site). Everywhere that lets you buy bitcoin will let you transfer it to your wallet. "
"My post probably confused more than it helped.

CAP theorem said pick any two (for a distributed database): Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance. Bitcoin chose all three: guaranteeing only eventual consistency in the event of a partition.

Append-only mean you can only add information, not remove it. Bitcoin enforces this with ""proof-of-work. You have to prove you burned so many joules for the right to add a block to the chain.

A hash is a way of mapping arbitrary data into an easy to handle number. For Bitcoin addresses, that hash represents your public key.

Segwit is short-hand for segregated witness: a convoluted upgrade to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash opted to just make the blocks bigger instead.

A Blockchain is explained in the original whitepaper. The paper actually avoids computing science analogies that would probably just confuse you."
I don't have any coins other than a fraction of BTC I no longer hold confidence in, but am too wise to not hold. Everyone here acts like it's a flaming train, but it's still stopping at every station and people keep getting on, so I'm gonna go a few more stations and sell at 25k n_n

"I've a quick question that I was hoping people could comment on.

I sold all my BTC the second BCH went on coinbase (I know........I really should have been in much earlier but I still got a decent price). I'm just sitting waiting now.......surely it's only a matter of time until the cashening happens with the cost of transactions and mining. What concerns me is that nearly every exchange you need BTC to buy BCH hence as BTC falls so does BCH, and vice versa.

At what point does this stop happening if the value of BCH is tied to the value of BTC? (as is pretty much every crytocurrency - as we saw Friday)

Thanks!"
"I agree with don-wonton. LN is a joke. Bitcoin cash are already working on higher block sizes - I wouldn't be surprised if they release a higher blocksize before LN comes to anything..........if this happens the freefall from BTC might happen even sooner.

I don't like Roger Ver whatsover. His tactics are ridiculous and if he didn't have such a big mouth BCC might be even closer to overtaking BTC already!

Anyways, my plan now is just to sit and let all this simmer. You just need to google bitcoin cash vs bitcoin to see that the pendulum is beginning to swing towards BCC big time."
"If BCH has much cheaper transaction fees, doesn't that mean lower fees for miners? Just curious, not attacking the sub

"Got all these cash rhymes moving electronically.  I'm actually a rapper, you're not - unironcially. You should press control P, and shove this paper up your butt psychotically.

Yes. Miners are paid out with the block rewards. Getting paid primarily in transaction fees is a bad system that was introduced in 2015 called RBF (replace by fee). It's one of the reasons transaction fees keep going up.
"There are peaceful outcomes that are more probable.

"litecoin founder just sold out entirely.  If Core raises bitcoin block size Litecoin is toast.  When BCH takes off in 2018 it will deflate Litecoin.  All the bitcoin maximalists got BCH in the fork - most kept them, the users base is primed and the businesses will cut over from bitcoin to bitcoin cash easily. Litecoin too associated with Core.  Litecoin even took on Segwit (for no real reason but to help Core convince miners it was ""safe"")."
DOGE address?
Thank you! Where does the tip go to???
"also consider something spiritual.  What if your thoughts of a violent outcome actually make it reality.  

What if you start thinking about a peaceful outcome then that too will become reality.  

This transition will be peaceful for some, and not for others.  You get to chose where to land on that...... I recommend peaceful. "
