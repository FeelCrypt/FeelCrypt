Of course I know that, did you read my post?

Miners are getting lots of small fees right now.  So that's incentive.  Do you honestly believe that if block rewards somehow were stripped out of the equation that the system would continue functioning normally and without problems?  

If it did, it could only be that many miners leave the game and the ones remaining have the side-effect of reducing the difficulty down to the point where mining becomes profitable again.  But now we have far less security for what most of you presume will be a much higher price.  That doesn't make sense.

"BCC forked from BTC 

BCC has a potential for growth

BTC has dominant market share.

I value both chains for different reasons I hold both, I am making slight adjustments in favor of BCC given the potential upside with long term growth. 

___

around November 18th BTC will fork again: **B-Core** and **B-2X**

I see the B-2X fork as competition for the BCC fork, 

BCC is superior as it won't limit transactions and does not have Segwit. B-2X has the advantage of having industry support, however it has a conservative transaction limit that may be enforced to enable segwit 

Segwit is not economically viable with no transaction limit - who will give a 75% discount to a $0.01 transaction fee when you can just include another full fee with no discount. With a limit and a $5 (or $50) transaction fee you get a 75% discount when you remove the signatures from the block, it's only economical viable when a transaction limit is enforces, both miners and users benefit from segwit with transactions are limited. However B-2X with a limit will not be able to compete with BCC in the long term, I'll hold both because I don't know if B-2X will fork to 4MB, I'll reassess when the fork to 4MB or 8MB comes. 

B-Core with a transaction limit is doomed in the long run, it may get lots of TPTB investment, they have spent a lot of effort limiting BTC growth and forcing future growth onto layer 2. 

One could hold it too (probably the most prudent strategy) I'm going to be selling into the growth and taking profit on this chain, I'll hold some of this chain.

"- First, you have to read how BCH and BTC works. no different from WOW. im sure its annoying listening to idiots on teamspeak or discord who dont know shit. Otherwise, its too complex to answer your question. its fine to be a n00b but this is about real money. So if you have BTC in an online wallet, Coinbase has your keys to the BCH. Who knows what they will do next year. TBD. you can take out your BTC now from online wallet if you want. it doesnt matter because you do NOT have the BCH keys anyway and that is TOTALLY SEPARATE - controlled by CB. after AUG 1st, BCH and BTC ARE ON COMPLETELY SEPARATE CHAINS.

Satoshi created BTC with a libertarian, anarchistic and philantropic vision. The appeal to him is the appeal to the principles that were placed to make BTC work that way. 

Those are the principles that BTC uses to market itself and that is the info you get when research for BTC. 

But then suddenly you get to 2017 where BTC turned into a private security owned by blockstream, which is owned by banks.

> Once fees go back to 3-5$ (the previous exodus threshold), what is going to happen?

Nothing good, but it's not the fees per-se. BCore seems to experience about one gigantic backlog period now about every 2-3 months with the next one just around the corner. So far each one has been bigger than the last. The last one peaked at ~200'000 stuck transactions and took a month to clear. The not good part is what happens when users who wildly FOMO'ed on Bitcoin realize that their coins are stuck, for a month, without them being able to either get it off or onto exchanges, or do anything with it at all. You can see this in the transaction rate after the peak of the last backlog. Bitcoin transactions dropped from nearly 4tps to around 2.5tps average. That's an average not seen since mid 2016. So basically a monthlong backlog undid ~1 year of Bitcoin adoption. It's starting to recover now, but, of course that'll culminate into the next even bigger backlog, I wonder how many years it'll wipe out this time."

"The chain was split a little under 1 month after the attack (before the attacker could extract the funds from the DAO contract).

In this time if you made a transaction it will have been rolled back on the main chain. True it was still on the ETC chain, but you can't deny it was rolled back on the main chain.

You say everyone had a choice, but did they really? The EF had a massive amount of investment capital to play with, ETC had nothing. If you were investing serious time and energy into building a Dapp what platform would you use? Add to this the fact that the EF holds the keys to the vast majority of ETC (from the premine), and they started to dump some of the coins after the split, which wrecked stability and confidence in ETC. 

For anyone doing real work on ETH and hoping to make a business out of it, there was no choice imo. This was even more so directly after the split... many people thought ETC would be dead and gone in a week back then.

"I don't think people mind the $10 as much as they mind not being able to get their coins onto or off exchanges, and have their transactions randomly take days or weeks or drop out of the mempool. Of course RBF doesn't work right so that doesn't help, and child pays for parent only increases the congestion more instead of solving it, so there's no effective way to outbid even if you wanted to. The only reasonable way to make sure your transaction happens reliably is to outbid the maximum fee presently advised by 2-3x. But of course that's no solution either, because for one people don't know how to do that in the first place, and for another, everybody who does that bumps somebody elses transaction off, so in aggregate, it does nothing but raise fees without any net-benefit to anybody than yourself. 

It usually takes me about 10 minutes to make a transaction consulting several fee statistics and calculating the size of the transaction given its inputs and outputs by hand. There's no wallet that's even remotely adequate in doing the right thing, and the usability is just abysmal. You can't seriously expect anybody who wants to to use bitcoin to be an expert at estimating fees and assembling transactions..."
That's a really positive outlook for someone who resorts to the term bcash.
So centralisation of miners is ok for you? You only concern about reddit censorship? What about asicboost? You better read case studies that block size increase is not a solution if you want to scale btc. Hard forks in the way you do is not good, you just damaging to bitcoin.

"It would depend on the specific hardfork change. That's why I made the current hardfork a ""non issue"" by saying if you started a new node that had no blocksize limit coded (and even if you made it segwit naive), it would still default to saying Bitcoin is the legitimate chain (according to the white paper rules), and bitcoin cash is an altcoin."

"""but I see nowhere in the video vitalik complaining about nape calling.""

Did I say *that*?"
">So centralisation of miners is ok for you?

No it's not.

Mining is quite centralized to China and it's not a good thing, but not disastrous either. It's mainly because of cheap/free electricity that is available there. Not because of block propagation. 

If other countries can provide competitive prices I'm sure that mining will move there.

>You only concern about reddit censorship?

I have other concerns, but reddit censoship is the topic of this thread.

>What about asicboost?

I don't mind Asicboost. Miner's goal is to make profit. They do this by mining more efficiently and by ensuring that Bitcoin stays robust and valuable. It's a competitive market and there are probably many other optimizations that we don't know about. 

When we figure out shortcuts we can ofcourse disable them in Bitcoin code if it's found necessary.

>You better read case studies that block size increase is not a solution if you want to scale btc.

I've read about it. 2 years ago it was said that 4 MB blocks would be the limit above which block propagation would cause problems. Much has changed during those two years and now Bitcoin could handle more (there has been improvements in Bitcoin as well as network infra).

Anyway, even without any hard blocksize limit we'd still be at around (or below) 2 MB blocks on the main chain. (just by looking at historical growth rate)

>Hard forks in the way you do is not good, you just damaging to bitcoin.

How so? I haven't observed any damage."
">Consesnus on closed doors is not a consensus.

Allright, lets call it hashrate consensus then. When over 90% of the total hashrate agrees it's some sort of consensus and it's the only one that is easily measurable in Bitcoin.

PoW is ofcourse not a perfect indicator, but that's how Bitcoin works. If you have better ideas, maybe you should fork and try it out. (I guess that's the idea behind UASF)

>You have poor devs. From senior devs nobody support s2x, and code is the law.

Not that it really matters, but is there someone more senior than Jeff who is still active in Bitcoin development? He's leading the SegWit2x effort. 

Ofcourse there's never enough and all bright devs should be welcome to improve Bitcoin in any way the can think of. More implementations, more ideas and more competition is a good thing.

>Miners is just a workers who works and shouldn't have decide what way to choose their are just labor.

Hashpower chooses to do whatever is most profitable. That's how Bitcoin's incentive system is maintained. It doesn't need good will from anyone. If it does, then the whole experiment is broken.

>How many times same persons tried to overtake bitcoin under bu, xt etc.. same will be with bcash.

I think it's your problem if you see competition between different implementations as some sort of attack. 

There are people who think the best and simplest way to increase Bitcoin's capacity is by removing the 1 MB blocksize limit. Is it surprising that these people support implementations that offer just that?

Bitcoin Cash is ofcourse different as it's a minority fork. Most Bitcoiners rightly believe that most PoW chain is the Bitcoin. But even then, there's no harm done and no way or even reason to prevent minority forks.

I don't think that our community gains anything from hostility or censorship. We should have discussed all these things together openly and without animosity in the first place. When people are well informed the best solutions will win.

>They just shown their uncompetence. And you wanna let them decide what is bitcoin.

I think the fork went just fine. Bitcoin Cash devs have no power to decide what is Bitcoin. Hashrate did and does that (and markets indirectly). Bitcoin is still Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.

>Only crazy ppl can do so. We already have segwit so 2x part is just unnecessary.

And that is your, hopefully informed opinion. I happen to disagree, but that's ok. I know I won't convince you otherwise or vice versa. 

I see no harm in 2x part, only good as SegWit alone (being optional) can't reliably alleviate the congestion problem. This is because SW doesn't increase the throughput instantly, but is a function of SegWit adoption (software and user support). 2x HF in contrast can bring immediate capacity increase for everyone.

I think that our difference is that you probably believe (sorry if I'm wrong) that fees, congestion and small blocks are needed and helpful to keep the network decentralized until better solutions (mostly 2nd layer) will deliver the good user experience. That's what many Core devs supposedly think anyway. 

My view is that decentralization only follows growth and increased usage on the main chain. More parties which depend on the blockchain for their business means more decentralization.

The future will show which view is the correct one. I'm sure there will be minority fork if Core devs don't get majority of miners behind their vision (last time SegWit only got to around 30% of total hashpower) and we will see both theories play out in practise."
I did note your comment about the no blocksize node. But is this relevant in practice? Is bitcoin cash simply not an alternative implementation of the bitcoin protocol?
">I don't see LN node centralisation as a major threat really.

Then we have nothing to talk about here since you dont care about what was the core feature of the BTC, and which is still marketed as if it's the case. "

"I'm talking not about geographic centralization but about few persons own very huge amount of hash. And that's a problem.

The security model of BTC requires competition and an Asicboost patent legally prevents this.  Covert ASICBOOST also breaks pooled mining.

Also asicboost may have been the leading reason to resist the protocol upgrade too, since changing the header format would be incompatible with ASICBoost. That makes the UASF necessary since in this case the interests of some miners are in opposition to the interests of the users.

And regarding hard fork we never had it and this should be done in more secure way with best devs not with few unknown clowns."
No, I mean I don't see it happening, not that I don't care about centralisation.
"Well actually I never said that *he complained about it* I said ""you just know that this is exactly the sort of behaviour Vitalik dissaproves of"".

I'm well aware, I'm the guy from that big thread in the Chomsky post. I spent several hours arguing with idiots who don't believe that Bitcoin is inherently libertarian.

That isn't relevant at all whether Bitcoin with SegWit is ""still Bitcoin"". There's nothing unlibertarian about SegWit. Also it wasn't a ""philanthropic vision"". Best candidate for Satoshi is Szabo... and he's a small blocker.

However, as Satoshi says in the whitepaper: longest proof-of-work chain is the true chain. BCH isn't that."
vitalik likes to show himself.
I could be mistaken, but I don't think they were rolled back at all.  I think they just made the coins unspendable.
"> No you idiot, no transactions were rolled back except the DAO hackers txs.

Technically those weren't rolled back either. There was the equivalent of an extra transaction (technically just a state transition, not a transaction) that moved the coins from the hacker's contract to a contract used to return them to their rightful owners. The original hack transactions are still part of the blockchain."
">Best candidate for Satoshi is Szabo

I'm pretty sure (like 98%) that Satoshi is dead. 

>That isn't relevant at all whether Bitcoin with SegWit is ""still Bitcoin"".There's nothing unlibertarian about SegWit

I was directly replying to your post, not to the main thread. Segwit makes centralizing BTC posible via the LN nodes. That's pretty ""unlibertarian"", specially taking in count that the company that provides that LN is owned by the ones Satoshi was intending to fight. 

> However, as Satoshi says in the whitepaper: longest proof-of-work chain is the true chain.

That's true. But I personally don't see BTC as THE BTC anymore. It has other variables, which makes it (and the rest of the variables) AltCoins or just another one of the bunch. 

It's a mere financial instrument controlled by the same that control any other financial instruments."
"Wow ok, my mistake.

No need to resort to name calling."
I could be completely wrong. Maybe Vitalik does think calling people childish names is the way to go.
A lot less than what you said. 
Yes confidence is eroded every time the big backlog happens. Markets are irrational, but this is a new bubble, we already know Bitcoin's problems, it shouldn't have started in the first place.

"I'm calling spade a spade.

Bitcoin valuation has gone up, so it doesn't seem like Bitcoin Cash is damaging it. Also, I believe that everyone has a right to support whatever project he/she wishes without being harassed.

I think that Bitcoin Cash is a good idea for several reasons:

1. It gives us a fallback chain, quite similar to original Bitcoin that has no SegWit (in case SegWit has any problems)

2. It gives us a non-congested chain, in case that 2x part of SegWit gets blocked.

3. It lets us experiment with a simpler malleability fix (Flextrans).

4. It shows that hard forks are nothing to fear about.

FYI I'm not against  NYA and I think it's nice that big players of the Bitcoin economy (miners, payment processors and exchanges) finally found a consensus, when it comes to increasing Bitcoin's capacity. If SegWit2x succeeds, I'm ok with it (It's a compromise) and I will hold on both chains."
"You're quoting out of context, read section 8 paragraph 2 where it talks about invalid chains with more hashpower ""overpowering"" the network; and notes that network nodes are not fooled because they verify transactions for themselves, and recommends that parties that receive payments frequently should run their own network nodes for security independence and validation speed. 

If more proof of work defined ""bitcoin"" then the whole section would make no sense. Rather, the network rules define what constitutes hashpower.  This is what is described in the whitepaper and it's how every version of the software worked.
"
Could it be argued that this is not considering hard forks?
"uh. block and transaction versions numbers are not for hardforks! If they were new numbers would be rejected by existing nodes but they are accepted.

">I'm talking not about geographic centralization but about few persons own very huge amount of hash. And that's a problem.
The security model of BTC requires competition and an Asicboost patent legally prevents this. Covert ASICBOOST also breaks pooled mining.
Also asicboost may have been the leading reason to resist the protocol upgrade too, since changing the header format would be incompatible with ASICBoost.

These big miners support SegWit2x. It forces activation of bip 141, which prevents covert ASICBoost. 

[edit] After reading more about it my understanding is that it prevents covert ASICBoost for blocks with witness data. (no difference there between SegWit2x or plain SegWit) To prevent usage of ASICBoost completely (for blocks without witness data) a hard fork is necessary. Dunno if worth it though.

>And regarding hard fork we never had it and this should be done in more secure way with best devs not with few unknown clowns.

Bitcoin Cash HF. A majority fork is even easier. If ""few unknown clowns"" (I'm not sure who you are referring to) can make it without an issue, then surely your ""best devs"" can do it super easy. There's also plenty of examples from other cryptocurrencies. Monero for example does hard forks regularly without any issues."

"/r/bitcoin have to apply heavy censorship, because if they allow any of these truths exposed, their entire bullshit narrative will be busted immediately:

1. Bitcoin is a new invention in finance, but it's old technology in computing tech.

2. At the end of the day Bitcoin is just a distributed, write once read many, 3 transactions per second, 200G database with sha256 validation between internal data. That is nothing in today's internet and hardware capacity no matter how you slice it.

3. Hundreds of scaling solutions capable of handling 1000x Bitcoin's data/traffic have been invented over the years across the entire industry, proven and in everyday use, simply apply some of them to Bitcoin and you can get 100x capacity boost, for example simply batch tx packets before sending them can reduce tx packet count by 500%, send compressed blocks directly can reduce block bandwidth by 20%+.

4. What's ultimatly holding the Bitcoin blockchain together are miners and the ring of super nodes where miners connect to each other, this ring guarantees your new tx to reach 99%+ of hash power within 3 seconds.

5. Miners who run these super nodes have economic incentives to keep these super nodes running and continue to upgrade them to meet capacity.

6. Normal PC + Raspberry Pi does not really matter as long as there are enough of them doing basic filtering and connection.

7. Low power nodes never mine any blocks, they don't even have to hold the complete blockchain, every check they do have to be done again by super nodes before mining the actual blocks anyway.

8. After a basic node count threshold is reached, your Raspberry Pi actually bogs down the system because it cannot make as many connections to other nodes as a more powerful machine.

9. The idea of having everyone able to run a full nodes at home as Bitcoin progress is stupid in the first place, scaling solution was forseen by Satoshi using SPV.

10. The SegWit/LN shills like to pretend once you move to Layer 2, the capacity require disappear, but that is a lie.

11. Layer 1 or 2, transaction data still has to be stored somewhere, checks still has to be run, splitting into layer 2 doesn't make those capacity requirement disappear, LN is proven to be bullshit and even if LN works, as Bitcoin progress and traffic increases, those LN nodes still have to be run by powerful servers. Or you'll have to remove historic TX and lose persistent accounting, removal which can already be accomplished right now by pruning nodes anyway.

12. Blockstream bullshitter like Greg Maxwell will always hide the fact that hardware technology is progressing faster than Bitcoin traffic itself, you can now buy 16 core CPU for $700, there are new storage tech such as Optane, which can do random <4k read/write at queue depth 1 with 15 microsecond latency under heavy load, which is 80x better performance than top of the class nvme SSD today. And when Optane moves away from PCIe it can handle even more.

13. The extend of the bullshit from Greg and alike will be obvious to newbies when traffic of alt coins without 1MB block size limit catches up, and they'll realize what a joke 1MB/2MB was, the same way you now look at 1MB/2MB USB sticks.

14. Blockstream/Core bullshitter such as Greg likes to pretend he's some kind of technology authority that can speak for all ""experienced dev"", but Greg is really just a former porn codec developer and a Wikipedia editor who got banned. When it comes to real tech he speaks like a moron going around in circle with bullshit jargon while avoiding basic key points.

15. If you run a banking cartel and want to stall Bitcoin's progress, then Greg is one of those short sighted talentless dev you'd like to hire, because he knows enough to throw bullshit tech jargon around to confuse newbies, but not good enough nor have the motivation to really accomplish anything great on his own, so he is grateful to get more fame than he deserve while delivering overly complex mediocre crap, and he won't have the skill/gut/motivation to refuse following bullshit demands.

16. /r/bitcoin newbies are often shocked once they realize both Adam Back (BS CEO) and Greg Maxwell (BS CTO) ignored Satoshi in the beginning, and they are not even part of the original Core developers, Adam Back never even submitted one line of code, they only got back to the scene years later, with help from banker funded Blockstream to kick away the original team members, and now they pretend they know what they're doing while spreading technical lies that is obvious to people in the tech field but not obvious to general users.

17. Greg Maxwell: ""When bitcoin first came out, I was on the cryptography mailing list. When it happened, I sort of laughed. Because I had already proven that decentralized consensus was impossible."". https://www.coindesk.com/gregory-maxwell-went-bitcoin-skeptic-core-developer/

18. Blockstream/BCore is really just a bunch of idiots who never believed in Bitcoin, that's why they need lies and censorship to sustain their fake authority.

Also yeah it seems like Vitalik has a lot of control over it. He's a benevolent dictator, granted, but a dictator nonetheless.  If he goes away some day, the precedent is there for there to always be an ""Emperor of Ethereum"" and I don't like that.

I dumped all for ETH. I do not want to be a part of the current bitcoin ecosystem.

You can think your adversary is making an error while benefiting from it. There is no contradiction here.
There is no censorship on btc. Sure they downvote things that aren't their dogma but they don't delete masses of threads and comments and resort comments by controversial and completely ban any talk of making bitcoin better.

Vitalik is smart guy, but I can't say the same for Bitcoin Core followers. One word: SHEEPLE
The culture itself in this country has veered so hard to the left, they idea of just hearing a foreign concept is rejected. 
As an outsider it's stuff like this makes me believe that bitcoin (and most likely all other cryptocurrencies) will ultimately fail.

Have you read Satoshi's white paper? Segwit is an altcoin, bitcoin cash is not. 
">ou call them ""narcissistic dipshits"" you just know that this is exactly the sort of behaviour Vitalik dissaproves of......

Is calling them narcissistic dipshits related in any way with censorship??"
Bitcoin is now the altcoin.
That's not the point
"> censorship by means can be just made by governments

why do you people keep using that shitty argument? you're not the first /r/bitcoin apologist to come over here and try to lecture us on the dictionary definition"
More the censorship really.
So the fact I am not personally as level headed as Vitalik is means what? I am not in the position he is, I'm just some angsty jerk-off redditor and wannabe trader, and I think the current crop of Bitcoin developers are a bunch of self-serving fuck sticks who ruined a great project from a place of greed and jealously. I'm mostly in ETH, I'll follow better men than I, and better ones than those who conspired to kill the Bitcoin I started with.
Don't try to equate censorship and moderation, shill.
"someone pushed for the iphone to happen, someone pushed for TCPIP to happen, someone pushed for Eth to happen. There is always someone. get over it. 

Someone even pushed for Bitcoin to happen. Difference here is that you dont know who satoshi is. But boy, thats a hell of a cult for someone nobody knows. 

In the case of bitcoin, we dont have satoshi speaking up, but we do have his ""extracts"". that seem to be a bible of some sort. So, its a benevolent dissapeared dictator. Not much better IMHO."
You like having g maxwell as your emperor? LMAO. 
"The DAO thing was unfortunate, there was no good choice there, just the lesser of two shitty decisions. I think they made the right one to punish the hacker and not allow him to derail the entire project by hijacking a significant percentage of total supply. 

Overall though that was not Ethereum's fault though, it was *the DAOs* code that was not properly audited. And yes it was a community decision that largely supported the rollback, wtf are you talking about.

ETC was just created by Barry Shillbert and a few butthurt Ethereum devs for the sole purpose of undermining Ethereum, not to be its own project. It has no real support or developmet, and is just a zombie coin now. 

Don't cry when the coin with massive support from real industry aside gambling aside beats Bitcoin's ass up and down for 2018."
"I don't mind you calling it an altcoin, but the name is Bitcoin Cash. If you say otherwise it's a lie and you know it. (facts are easy to check)

This is nonsense. There was overwhelming support for the hard fork.

"Don't be silly, there was overwhelming support for Ethereum's hard fork.

Also, don't forget Bitcoin's ""immutable"" blockchain was also reversed at block 74638 to handle an overflow error.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident

>On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses.[1][2][3] Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.[4]

>A new version of the client was published within five hours of the discovery that contained a soft forking change to the consensus rules that rejected output value overflow transactions (as well as any transaction that paid more than 21 million bitcoins in an output for any reason).[5] The block chain was forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the ""bad"" block chain, the ""good"" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691[6] at which point all nodes accepted the ""good"" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history.

>The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain. Therefore, the bitcoins created by it do not exist either. While the transaction does not exist anymore, the 0.5 BTC that was consumed by it does. It appears to have come from a faucet and has not been used since.[7]
