Have a little more respect for people... no need for such heaviness my friend.
And its obvious how that can be possible. A person buys some ledgers and sells them at half price on gumtree... ebay seller sees this great deal of ledgers for sale on gumtree at 50% off and buys the lot. Seller is unaware they have been tampered with and sells them on ebay.

"Bitcoin Cash making great progress in North Queensland - because it works.

Edit: It is an electronic billboard and quite genuine.

"
I don’t follow your question? Are you suggesting bitcoin cash is no different from other coins? Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are forks off the same chain so for huge parts of the economy they are both Bitcoin. We adopted the Cash suffix to uniquely identify that we are not digital gold, but cash for real p2p daily use.
"Ok everyone, gather round.  

See how the troll falsely stated that the picture was fake?  An easily debunked lie, because trolls are not smart.  If they were, they’d stop leading such sad lives trolling internet strangers.

Now, look closely at the trolls reaction once called out.  Did they prove their point?  Provide evidence?

Nope!  They use terms like Bcash and bring up more, completely unrelated, false statements with, again, zero evidence to back it up.

Now, I risk this troll changing his tactics by telling you what they usually do next, and that’s insults, name calling, basically trying to get you riled up enough to be as toxic as they are so they can infect our community with their childish behavior.

Just remember, trolls are sad people to be pitied. After all, if they had reasonable sources for their claims, and presented them without immaturity, they wouldn’t be trolls.  They’d be normally functioning human beings.

BCH has the largest coin distribution of any crypto.
Almost everyone who's in crypto has Bitcoin and also Bitcoin Cash (from the fork). The number of people who hold XRB don't even hold a candle to BCH's numbers.
"> It has the same bottlenecks

1mb vs 8mb (soft up to 32mb).

> minus LN

Tipprbot is a pretty good proof of concept that LN isn't required

> and Segwit very soon

Segwit increases blocksize by 4x, which you're just about to argue doesn't fix the problem (permanently).  
Also destroying the blockchain integrity isn't a feature.

> Simply increasing the size doesn't fix that permanently?

Why not? It can be increased again (and has already been considered)."
"Don't know what you've been reading (or not), but no one claims increasing the block size limit doesn't scale. The only claim is that scaling this way makes Bitcoin more centralized, and that's not true. 

Bigger blocks are the way Bitcoin was meant to scale from day one. LN is a Frankenstein project from Blockstream and *will* be released, someday. "
but it does
nothing against bch, but it would take a tremendous amount of effort and/or time to get to bitcoins transaction volume. not worried
Sorry. Bitcoin Cash has 0-conf instant transactions. No other crypto can do an over the counter trade faster. It is even faster than your lightning network which has to make multiple interactive hops to an online recipient.
Will be... when? Businesses need to make money now.
"> It will be faster and cheaper than BCH

[What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor)"
Then why hasn't it happened yet?
Segwit and LN just change the fee structure so that a middle man again collects it.  In addition to use LN, it is expected to be more like a bank account, where you must commit a pool of money ahead of time, from which to spend.  
If the difference is significant, then people would use that.  We're talking business here, not college football.

Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks sure but it also has 0-conf instant transactions, a scaling roadmap to 10B people doing 50 TXs/day, the largest coin distribution of any crypto, a decentralised development effort, and a community held together by vision and generosity rather than censorship and deceit.

There is an observation that by expanding mere capacity, that capacity is used and you're left with about as much capacity as you had before. I can't remember the actual term for this but it applies outside of Bitcoin in many areas. The LN solves for this observation. What we need is more efficient transactions so that when the capacity is used up, we've already exhausted every other attempt at fitting more transaction data in.
If anybody ever asks me what the Dunning-Kruger effect is I'll point them directly to your post.
"> You get people looking at things in computer science terms get downvoted

Yeah, I notice that. I can't say much about LN because I haven't bothered to educate myself about it.  If it can escape the O(n) catastrophe that's great. Until then, kick the can."
"Segwit isn't exponential. It increases blocksize by 4.

LN may as well be any centralised off chain payment processor (like tipprbot)."
Doesn’t Ethereum already move more volume than BTC daily?
I might've misread something, and misunderstood your comment.
You cant accept bitcoin becouse tax. Every business which accepts BTC have to change it right away. 
True, but its still not a given that the new fork becomes the main fork.
"Well, *arguably* no one has a claim to “BTC”, or even “Bitcoin”, especially in the context of a fork.
I think it’s fair to say this is a “Bitcoin” sub, just one that aligns with the Bitcoin Cash fork. Remember, many of us here owned bitcoin wayyyy before the fork and consider Bitcoin cash to be *part* of the general Bitcoin movement. This sub existed long before the fork. Sadly, there has been a highly vitriolic us vs them mentality, but it’s mostly propagated by a vocal minority.

It’s reductive to reduce the letters BTC to the ticker that the other fork trades under. There is /r/bitcoincash for specific discussion about the cash side of the fork. /r/btc is more about raising awareness that there is an alternative to the segwit fork, which sadly became necessary due to unethical moderation practices in /r/bitcoin 😞"
"> There is an observation that by expanding mere capacity, that capacity is used and you're left with about as much capacity as you had before.


I don't disagree that the extra capacity will be expanded into, the mistake is thinking you are not much better off.


by expanding capacity we allow more users to use the network, this scales the usefulness of the network quadratically See [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law).  this seems to be held up by real world data at current low blocksizes from Peter R's  [data](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=400235.msg5882283#msg5882283) on bitcointalk. 


> The LN solves for this observation. 


no it doesn't it's problematic on a tiny network never mind working at scale, your pinning your hopes on  something that is unclear whether it will work out. see routing problems, constant hot wallets, stateless vs statefull tx's, node exhaustion etc


> What we need is more efficient transactions so that when the capacity is used up, we've already exhausted every other attempt at fitting more transaction data in.


that would bee nice, but you cannot know you have exhausted every other possible way to shrink tx size, in reality it is a tradeoff, increasing the network effect is by far the best bang for the buck at the present time.

yeah, its awesome... but it was created many years after btc already went through growing pains so it learned from that and is structured differently with more flexibility in how it can be scaled
It's *weird* when this argument devolves into people on the anti-crypto side (I couldn't think what else to call it and isn't that what it is) getting to the point of saying that people don't use crypto.

"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"Sadly, crypto is confusing. And we do have a duty to demystify it. But people do have a right to at least have a chance of learning about the differing versions of Bitcoin, and their pros and cons (something banned in /r/bitcoin). I think perhaps you underestimate people’s abilities to grasp there are two versions (even more in fact) of Bitcoin. Or perhaps you just secretly wish BCH didn’t exist. I seriously doubt the 3 letter path to this sub, is causing some kind chaos in the space. I know of several new users to the space who loosely understand there are two versions, and that they are scaling in differing ways with differing trade offs. They tend to buy bitcoin because they “want the more expensive one”, and “isn’t that other one a scam?” but when they learn of current limitations some have also bought Cash. The general pulse at the moment seems to be people’s disbelief in the sustainability of “digital gold”, and a gut instinct that it needs to be usable as cash to survive. This sub provides an alternative to the digital gold narrative.

I think if this sub post dated the creation of bch you would have a more compelling argument, but it’s not. It’s a bitcoin sub with differing moderation policies to /r/bitcoin. It allows free and open discussion about many coins, and bch just happens to get a lot of coverage."

"Scalability means a lot more than changing a line that says 'x=1' to 'x=8' and planning on making it 'x=32' if need be.  Scalability is an effort to achieve O(ln(n)) performance rather than what you're looking at now, the abysmal O(n).

I have never heard of any scaling solution for either Bitcoin or any of its offshoots.  But of course you are free to kick the can down the road and worry about the problem in a few more years when changing a variable won't solve your problems. "
"Why not? Because there's practical limits to bandwidth, especially when we consider people who more urgently need crypto in less developed countries like Venezuela. Common sense should prevail on that one.

Also, Tipprbot working on an exponentially less used network isn't a good proof of concept. If we actually want BCH to become a practical currency saying ""no durr increase block size"" is not pragmatic as the trade volume vs other currencies right now is dismal.

There's a reason scalability and computer science use Big O and why calculus focuses on the derivative for rate of growth vs the base number.  Scalability implies more than just throwing a few MBs. If you're making this argument as a primary one, it's basically showing a lack of common sense and knowledge about algorithms and big data. If this is the common sentiment for BCH investors that's not good because it implies there is no consideration for practical concerns with adoption (and they're not gonna be adequately emphasized by the community)."
Not worried about?
"BCH would chew through BTCs transaction volume without noticing it, the bigger blocks can handle way more traffic than BTC currently can,an that ""stress test"" a few weeks back proved that pretty nicely."

Personally, I see trolls like you as a reminder we’re on the right track.  I’m glad blockstream is scared and on the attack.  BCH will prevail because it’s helping change lives around the world.

I agree with Amaury that there are more important stuff to worry about, but I'm perfectly cool with people using whichever colors, even both. Personally, I think that that green is the best color.

None of that matters, a GB blocks can handle visa level transactions and there's already talk about TB blocks. At the current rate we're more than just a few years away from even needing GB blocks and they're pretty much possible with todays technology.
"yeah exactly. You get people looking at things in computer science terms get downvoted; it's not about linear algorithms but exponential scaling. LN and Segwit aren't linear solutions, they are exponential."
">Why not? Because there's practical limits to bandwidth, especially when we consider people who more urgently need crypto in less developed countries like Venezuela. Common sense should prevail on that one.

The whole concept behind Bitcoin is that everyone is selfish. As soon as the protocol requires people to not act in their own self interest, we may as well go back to fiat.

People in less developed countries don't need to verify blocks to send and receive Bitcoin.

Not an exponential expression.

Since you havent actually provided any evidence of these assertions, I'll just turn this around on you: ""no durr don't increase the block size"".  
My argument is now just as logical as yours.

Strawman. Big O describes computational complexity / performance, not storage, which still remains at O(1) to store a transaction. Is this the Core latest talking point? Really gotta try harder.

I'll let you know when the size of TV shows stop growing exponentially as resolution increases. I guess this is the end of times for entertainment. Or maybe I could point to the exponential increase in available storage, or bandwidth or any of the other Moore's law lookalikes. I think we'll be fine.

Better publicity potential for us here. Enables us to educate the wider bitcoin community as to the benefits of bitcoin cash more easily.

"/u/vbuterin this is an outright lie; which you are presumably making to wave away your motivations for a premine now valued in billions of dollars.

If it were true, you'd be able to point to specifically public communication where you attempted any such thing.  You cannot because you simply didn't do it-- not that it would have made any sense in any case.

You can run your little scam however you like, but if you tell lies like this you will get called out.

How the hell is Ethereum a scam? Also shouldn't you be over at /r/bitcoin shilling your own little scam network?
How is it a scam?
"I recommend not reading sensationalist headlines and clicking through to my actual words:

> “The very earliest versions of ETH protocol were a counterparty-style metacoin on top of primecoin. Not Bitcoin because the OP_RETURN wars were happening at the time and given what certain core developers were saying at the time, I was scared that protocol rules would change under me (eg. by banning certain ways to encode data in txs) to make it harder, and I did not want to build on a base protocol whose development team would be at war with me,” said Buterin.

It is true that I never actually attempted to make ethereum a meta-protocol on top of bitcoin, unless you count my few weeks working on the Mastercoin protocol and back in October as part of the ""making ethereum"" process. The OP_RETURN drama pre-emptively pushed me toward building ethereum on Primecoin instead of Bitcoin. The primecoin plan was scrapped because we ended up getting more attention and resources than we expected, and so we could build our own base layer and add upgrades like ASIC-resistant PoW and state trees.

And by the way, the ""I made a separate blockchain so I could have a premine"" bit is itself very much fake news. I don't remember whether or not Mastercoin had a premine, or the distribution was 100% sold to initial buyers, but Mastercoin is a separate currency despite being on top of Bitcoin, so it's totally possible to make a Mastercoin-like thing with a premine."
Blockstream is the scam

Love to hear this.
Oh, indeed, sorry
