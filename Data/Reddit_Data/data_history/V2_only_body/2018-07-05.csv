I don't think I'm disagreeing with you on what is or is not bitcoin. Im purely pointing out some errors in your reasoning that lead to confusion on this r/btc forum. 1. Bitcoin Core is a terrible name as its the same name as the reference software, 2. Having both forks called bitcoin is obviously confusing, 3. Having the Oct 17 fork called Bitcoin Cash fixes the issue.
