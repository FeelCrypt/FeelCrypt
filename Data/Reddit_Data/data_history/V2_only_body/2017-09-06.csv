Do you have screenshots of the twitter account asking exchanges to use bcash?
"> With Bitcoin Cash, everyone I've spoken or listened to uses BCC, BCH, Bcash, or Bitcash during casual conversation.

That's because you live in an echo chamber"
"I exist in all chambers, my friend.

Well, except r/Bitcoin. I was banned there today for promoting SegWit2x."
***Yes***. Because market cap doesn't say much about how much money is needed to move the price of an asset - the elasticity of demand and supply say that, and market cap tells you nothing about either.
You are wrong. EQ bank in Canada 2.4%
This is the same thing as Bitonnect! They have an unlimited amount of BCC and can dump them on the market to keep the price stable.
">The fake tethers are being used to stabilize the falling tether price and artificially keep the price stable.

Issuing more units of a currency won't support the falling price of said currency. If there's any effect it would be seen in the value of other cryptos."
">  BTC is the only one that Joe-schmoe knows

 Joe-schmoe does not know Bitcoin either. Until my father calls me that he is worried about his financial assets and wants to buy some bitcoin (which he has never heard about outside from me) bitcoin is not and will not be known by the average human citizen. "
Santander was teeter on insolvency itself not so long ago, may still be the case. Most stable U.S. banks will not give rates like that unless it is a teaser rate on a CD or something. Certainly not on a savings account. We have to buy BTC to get 5%+ :D
This is really good comment / explanation
It's the same old story. A big exchange get's hacked but that it not the end of it, no, it looks like the exchange survived and everybody is happy. But in reality it's the beginning of the end. As long as the exchange has enough incoming funds it can get away with everything. But then more stuff happens, people start loosing faith and start withdrawing their funds, the big players first cause they have good knowledge and intuition or they would not be big players. The exchange tries to do everything possible to stay up and running but eventually it becomes so empty in side that a collapse is imminent. The fact that banks have the power to make it as hard as possible for an exchange to stay alive does not help. Banks are not stupid, a big enough succes with crypto would not be good for a lot of banks. And so there is both bad regulation (the banks) and no regulation (no external audits, internally the exchange can do whatever they want) going on at the same time. As crypto get's more mature this will change but right now we are still in the wild west. 
So there is not cap on how many tethers there can be? If this is the case then we need a 3rd party to ensure that all the tethers are indeed backed up by dollars!
