No, I’m Negan!
For sure he is
He is.
What is Satoshi?
I am the ~~Senate~~ Satoshi.
Bitcoin Cash SV is more true to the vision of peer-to-peer cash than Bitcoin Cash ABC. ABC is trying to be a new Ethereum.
Some people are just stucked
I’m definitely not satoshi
How so? If you can be explicit about that, maybe we can discuss further?
"If I were Craig (and Satoshi), I would try to tease people about it but definitely not give real proof until the moment to take BTC down comes.

&#x200B;

I am not sure if people are aware, but once the BCH chain is controlled (which will, regardless of the ABC short sided arguments, sorry), BTC is the next target. There can only be one real bitcoin protocol and I know which one it is. By controlled I mean organic growth, not the centralised crazy fuckin checkpointing that ABC did, that is just dishonest and not the Bitcoin protocol that gave me spine happiness chills when I found it for the first time.

&#x200B;

Yes yes, you can laugh now about what seems to be an incredible difficult event, but if SV actually deliver a bitcoin at scale with thousands or millions of daily transactions, I have a really hard time trying to think about someone that still prefers to stay on the ""store of value"" chain, which is slowly proving everyone (that wants to see) that BTC does not serve the ""store of value"" purpose.

"SV is focusing on big blocks, on-chain scaling, and use for Bitcoin as cash payments.

ABC is about enabling more smart contract functionality because they want their own ICO boom."
Why do u ignore nChain plans for tokenization? Math opcodes that SV re-introduced give more smat contract functionality than ABC's opcodes
How so? Do you mean DSV?
I don't know the details. I'm just talking about the general marketing and vision I've seen described by supporters of each chain. SV seems much more focused on P2P cash, with fewer side distractions.
"That may be the marketing message you are getting, but I honestly believe that the only way to be sure that your position is related to the actual situation is to understand the practical details and make a judgement from there. My view is entirely different to yours. I know SV *claim* that moral standpoint, but I see no technical evidence of it. In fact, it appears quite the reverse to me - i.e. the ABC guys are making valid tech calls on the situation.

My 2 satoshi."
"> I don't know the details

Trust no one, go and learn the details. There's no more improtant vote than voting with your wallet for open blockchains"
"> I don't know the details.

And therein lies the problem, you've been had by propaganda mate."
Ver and Wright are both morons. The fact ANYONE believed either of them in the first place is pathetic. Good luck tho!
I was Satoshi.
Dad jokes in a motion! 
"> I don't know the details

Please research on the subject first before talking about it"
Maybe I’ll be Satoshi
"But guys I'm Satoshi.

PM me for proof.

*Man, that was easier to prove than I thought it was gonna be.*"
Make like a tree...and get out of here
Could it be that the real Satoshi is the friends we made along the way...…
Exactly!
"He's the best that crypto kid;-) "
My sides!!! hahaa
Hahaaa!!! Kiddo
Nice move
Where is Satoshi?
great joke!
Watch Jimmy Nguyen's speech: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNpo2mYcHGw&t=1166s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNpo2mYcHGw&t=1166s). He's hitting all the right notes on p2p cash. 
That something this shitty gets this many upvotes(even if most are from bots) proves that this community has gone down the shitter... Congrats on your new /r/bitcoin. I guess this is proof that reddit really is a lot worse than the chans.
Bitcoin Gold
I'm already Satoshi
"You're Satoshi, you're Satoshi, you're Satoshi, I'M SATOSHI! Is there anyone else in this house that isn't Satoshi.

Gary: \*meow\*"
Maybe Manuel Neuer ist Satoshi
I am Satoshi.
Who Satoshi?Satoshi not here man.
that'll do bif
Why is Satoshi?
Litterally no open discourse here. Just us v them all the time
Fuck go back
Vitalik has strongly been against CSW for a while now. People should have started listening earlier 
That's right Comrade, everybody that does not agree with you is a sock puppet.
umm.. who'd you think controls this sub? and has moderators on it? take a look at their mod logs, might give you a clue if you're bothered enough and have enough intelligence to see through some of the bullshit
That’s true. A lot of people were okay with the “useful idiot” aspect of him. But now we know that may have not been the best course of action 
I dumped all my eth after that, I was in pre-dao.  Fuck that commie.
MY WIFE STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ME!
"[Yeah, about that...](https://i.imgur.com/Nj4p5n8.png)

edit: oooh this tweet has put /r/btc in a bind. Do I reject censorship or do I defend Vitalik? Insert red button meme."
"Sure Vitalik doesn´t like a guy with the resources of CSW in a competing crypto.
"
A decent chunk of us have been opposed to CSW for a long time. I'd like to say the majority but I can never really be sure on these subs which are filled with sockpuppets from various sides.
"Vitalik was ahead of the curve on this disaster since he had deep enough technical knowledge of crypto to realize CSW was a fraud and spouted nothing more than meaningless techno babble.

It took the rest of us non-dev cypherpunks time to catch up.

Sociopaths like CSW also prey on people's inherent good will not to believe others are pathological liars and scam artists out to harm you.

P.S. I didn't decide on CSW as a complete narcissistic fraud until about 3-4 months ago."
Is that kiddie porn Vitalik?
A decent chunk excluding Jihan and Roger I guess. It was good to have a figure head by their side, even a fake one, and it's only recently that Roger Ver has serious doubts that Craig is satoshi.. Well, duh.. This is what you get for nurturing a psychopathic scammer.
"Bitconn**EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT**

***SATOSHI VISSSSSSION*** "
"It really did! He's right.
"
Vitalik is one of the smartest men in the crypto space. Too bad we lost him when Core ostracized him. We also lost Mike Hearn back then, too. Two terrible blows to our community.
Did he finally do the 10k ETH giveaway?
