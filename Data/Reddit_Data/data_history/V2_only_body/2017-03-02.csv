"People did starve and economies did fail. The only reason the bottom didn't fall out like in the great depression was due to multiple bailout's from tax holders to stop the bleeding, then the Central Bank printed more money creating record inflation. Even with the use of FDR era protections, a tax payer based bailout was needed in order to prevent keys banks from failing. (QE alone wouldn't have been enough).

Those who have been unemployed since 2008, have seen less purchasing power when returning to the work force, so although the unemployment rate is going down the workforce earns less. 

Additionally countries like Spain went from 1 in 10 people being unemployed to 1 in 4 from 2008 to now, indicating a completely downturn in the economy.

This is why the first block in Bitcoin references the global bailouts from the UK perspective of the UK Central Bank bailing out Britain in 2009. 

But whatever. Lets make a Bitcoin central bank with the miners in control! People are obviously too stupid to regulate themselves."
"> obviously they are or 2008 crisis would have resulted in ATM's being empty and people starving as economies failed.

it's not an argument. it's a very simple fact. but it's not surprising that facts don't go down well with the BU crowd.
"You've now called FUD I think 4 times on me (twice here and twice elsewhere in this thread). At all times all I'm seeking is answers to questions and ones that are both obvious and are being asked by many in the community.

That is a pure tactic to avoid real answers and get other readers on your side. It is no different than the current trend of calling ""FAKE NEWS"" on anything you disagree with. Here it is ""FUD"" for anything that questions your software. Just apologize, really that is your best move here.

Placebo controls: You didn't answer the question, instead you sought to paraphrase it incorrectly. 

>You and the author of that article seem to think that the controls given to a node should be able to control the behavior of the rest of the network

Nope nothing of the sort. The issue is more like: I have EB set to 2mb and AD at some smallish number (number 4-30 whatever), blocks start arriving at 3mb. My node ignores until AD is breached, at which point my node starts accepting all those blocks. Does my node now start taking any size block? 4mb, 12mb without any wait period? If this is the case, that is why it is referred to as Placebo controls because with certain settings and a rising block size your node will just take whatever. Yes you can set AD to large value and fork off. Ok. Still you should admit that BU operators would have to be more aware of block size changes and adjust their settings appropriately (and restart I assume or can it be done on the fly?) during those periods. 

> But the real question is will the minority fork survive and be economically significant? 

Probably. There are enough core supporters out there to make this happen. Seems pretty likely to me yes. You didn't touch on Replay issues/attacks. Got anything for that?

>Since BU is based on Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus, the adversarial attacks are limited to what is currently possible 

Well there was the discussion about the miner who sets EB between values of others miners. This didn't need 51% as described. I don't know how likely it is or what the impact is, but you shouldn't just hand wave over attacks even if unlikely or difficult. That is how we build up understanding of the security model.

>I can't debunk every Aaron Von Wirdum comment here, but plenty of people already responded to this article.

Ahh one of your FUDs. No I don't know much about your team. THAT IS THE POINT. Calling FUD every few paragraphs is unlikely to make me think you are intelligent. Stop antagonizing curious people. 

>Once BU proves that hard forks can happen -- that the network can be upgraded -- solving problems like malleability are simple.

So a hard fork for that? Is BU in favor of hard forks in general over soft forks? Would soft forks be used for anything or generally avoided? These are pretty legit questions I would think.

"So let's look at context for the imagined scenario:

>Additionally, a malicious miner can often split the network. Such a miner could monitor the EB levels signaled by other miners (which is not as easily spoofed), and intentionally mine a block that falls right in between what these miners will accept. **If some 50 percent of hash power accepts blocks up to two megabytes, and the other 50 percent supports bigger blocks**, a 2.01 megabyte block would be ignored by the first 50 percent, and accepted by the other 50 percent.

>Assuming the default AD of four is maintained, the chain could split for more than an hour. As explained in the previous section, the Bitcoin network(s) would be very unreliable during this period, as the chain on either side of the split may be discarded.

>An adversary controlling only 0.7 percent of global hash power...

Yep, that certainly falls into the category of ""ignoring economic incentives and imagining that people will set their settings in a completely arbitrary and economically-irrational manner."""

It was FUD until you added some concrete reasons.   Thank you for taking the time to do so.
"Hi,

I'd just like to clarify some things about Nakamoto consensus in this context. 

First of all while Nakamoto consensus is often considered to be a direct solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem, this may actually not quite be the case.

The Byzantine Generals Problem makes an a priori assumption about who the distinguished sender is (The sending general) and the goal is that all correct participants either agree on the general's message or that he is faulty. This problem is actually a Terminating Reliable Broadcast (TRB) in a Byzantine failure setting which is strictly harder than a set of processes wanting to reach consensus on a value or set of values in a Byzantine failure setting (there are some finer points here when some forms of consensus such as interactive consistency are actually equivalent and when not). I'll refer to this latter problem as **Byzantine consensus** since the term *Byzantine agreement* is ambiguous and in the literature often refers to either Byzantine Generals Problem *or* Byzantine consensus.

Loosely speaking Nakamoto consensus is a mechanism for reaching (eventual) agreement or eventual Byzantine consensus by an unknown, possibly changing, set of participants in the presence of Byzantine faults, though the details and properties are much more complex and this is still an ongoing research topic in the scientific community. It is actually relevant over *what* you want to form consensus in this context - Nakamoto consensus over a distributed ledger that gets updated continuously has quite different properties to using Nakamoto consensus for reaching binary agreement. 

This brings us to the two statements you made which are a misunderstanding about how consensus protocols generally work.

> The big issue here is that Bitcoin was invented to replace the cumbersome, slow and costly human or user consensus in banking and finance with a predictable and more efficient machine consensus.

""Machine consensus"" protocols have actually existed for quite some time. The precursory paper of the Byzantine Generals Paper (called Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults by Pease, Shostak and Lamport) was published in 1980 and may be seen as one of the very early works that played an important role in the field of distributed consensus. What you refer to ""machine consensus"" protocols are basically formalizations of what steps participants have to take to arrive at an outcome where certain guarantees are upheld. These can mostly also be conducted without computers by humans so the analogy is incorrect.

The actual innovation of Nakamoto consensus and Bitcoin is that you have a **Decentralized** Byzantine consensus protocol where the set of participating nodes can readily change (and can be unknown!). Previous Byzantine consensus solutions generally assumed a static set of consensus nodes (weaker system models where only crash-failures can occur make dynamic membership sets significantly easier to achieve).

Another important issue that has been creeping up recently in this context which I'm personally not happy with is the notion that fully validating nodes that do not provide proof-of-works (i.e. a non-mining full node) are consensus participants. By all means if you consider the mechanisms behind Nakamoto consensus the only way to extend the blockchain, thereby strengthening the agreement on previous blocks, is by publishing new valid proofs-of-work. A non-mining full node can only validate for itself and potentially gossip this information but in terms of the actual consensus only proof-of-work has any changing impact.

> Now BU comes around and changes this single most significant breakthrough in bitcoin and goes back to a manually adjustable human ""consensus"" with all it's know downsides and with the need to trust the miners.

The underlying problem here is actually very hard. 
What you mistakenly consider ""human consensus"" is the problem that any node in a distributed system only effectively can trust itself that it runs protocol A and must assume that its peers are also following said protocol A. 
Say there is another node that runs a slightly different version of the protocol called A' != A. Some of the behaviour may be the same but some may not. 
Effectively A would consider A' a Byzantine node and vice versa.

What you really want is consensus over the protocol rule set by participating nodes - that is to agree upon a protocol version C.
Well how could one achieve this goal? The answer lies in proof-of-work and Nakamoto consensus. 
Voting by computational power is an effective means to counter Sybill attacks and can support an anonymous and changing set of participants. 
This is currently not done dynamically - i.e. the protocol rules your client adheres to is based on the software you chose to download and run and not through some evolving consensus process.

I've been pondering about Gavin Andresen's definition of Bitcoin as basically the Chain with the most double-SHA256-proof-of-work that extends the genisis block and in this context it is a better definition that initially meets the eye.

Sorry for the long post and I hope there was some helpful information here and there,

Yeah, I've heard this story before. I find it to be an *extremely* unconvincing argument. See the convo I had [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5sq5fv/contentious_forks_vs_incremental_progress/ddzdy5m/) for an explanation of why that is.
" > Some of the questions that arise are: what this will do to the existing bitcoin ecosystem? how the new ecosystem will arise and what problems might be caused by these new ""knobs""? and will this change effect the large economic power currently stored in bitcoins?

This is more FUD in question format.  You could ask the exact same questions for SegWit, or even for doing nothing (and letting fees spiral out of control).

>   ""Placebo Controls""

The controls BU gives a node allow the node to affect ITS OWN operation.  Rather than being run over by the larger blocks, a node can choose to ignore the larger block fork.  You and the author of that article seem to think that the controls given to a node should be able to control the behavior of the rest of the network and therefore conclude that the controls are ineffective.  This is a fantasy in a distributed trustless network.

> Permanent chain split

No decision will ever get 100% agreement so a chain split is possible.  And a chain split can happen at any time given Bitcoin's architecture.  BU will be the majority fork by definition (it is programmed to follow the majority fork, so if BU is not the majority fork there will be no chain split).  But the real question is will the minority fork survive and be economically significant?  There have been many articles explaining why this will not be the case.  It basically boils down to the fact that a larger block chain can do everything a 1 MB block chain can do, but better.

But if the minority fork succeeds, it must have found an economic niche (think darwinian evolution) that the other fork was not able to fill.  In this case it is better for Bitcoin holders to have a Bitcoin fork fill that niche than an altcoin.  This is the ethereum situation -- the fork persisted because there are 2 fundamentally different coins in philosophy.  One coin is truly trustless, the code is the law.  In the other coin, the ethereum foundation can unwind things if something goes really wrong...

> Adversarial attacks by malicious miners

Since BU is based on Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus, the adversarial attacks are limited to what is currently possible (basically you need > 50% of the hash power).  And there are strong economic incentives for miners to not be malicious.  There are lots of other avenues for attack by entities that are not profit driven -- state actors could simply declare bitcoin illegal.  Other actors could artificially limit the transaction supply space to make Bitcoin's fees no better than legacy payment systems and its performance much worse.

> Other points mentioned here

I can't debunk every Aaron Von Wirdum comment here, but plenty of people already responded to this article.

> Strength and size of the BU development team

I don't think that you know anything about our strength or engineering experience, and very little about the Core team, so this is FUD.  And I am happy to provide my resume to any influential person or company considering running BU, I just don't feel like it needs to be plastered all over Reddit.   WRT size, there is a lot of research about how bigger is not better in software development.

> malleability

Once BU proves that hard forks can happen -- that the network can be upgraded -- solving problems like malleability are simple.  Malleability is a bug with a simple fix, IF you can change the transaction format.

Says who? With something like SegWit and Schnorr bitcoin will be getting a scaling boost that puts it far ahead of the competition. Aggregated signatures from schnorr is probably one of the most epic things to come to crypto currency in recent times. And bitcoin can have it, we have the developers who can make it happen. Just need SegWit. SegWit will also fix malleability, which enables lightning tech. It will also fix quadratic hashing - which again puts most bitcoin clones to shame, and allows for even bigger blocks. It is sad to see when people are saying bitcoin dont have shit going on for it they just need to open their eyes. "
No not FUD. Don't start down the track of nullc by attacking everyone that has questions or concerns. See my [reply here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5x0p5k/gavinrun_bitcoin_unlimited_it_is_a_viable/deetce1/).
"You are right. BU doesn't fundamentally change anything.

>But by making this [block size] control more explicit and easier to handle, and assuming users actually use these options, Bitcoin Unlimited does rely on the human consensus aspect to a much larger extent.

The big issue here is that Bitcoin was invented to replace the cumbersome, slow and costly human or user consensus in banking and finance with a predictable and more efficient machine consensus.

Now BU comes around and changes this single most significant breakthrough in bitcoin and goes back to a manually adjustable human ""consensus"" with all it's know downsides and with the need to trust the miners.

This makes no sense whatsoever. It would be smarter to just stop using bitcoin all together.

"Putting the settings in people's hands is indeed a bold idea that is based on sound intentions (letting people decide what works for them). Some of the questions that arise are: what this will do to the existing bitcoin ecosystem? how the new ecosystem will arise and what problems might be caused by these new ""knobs""? and will this change effect the large economic power currently stored in bitcoins?

Some of the more specific issues are:

* [""Placebo Controls""](https://medium.com/@alpalpalp/bitcoin-unlimiteds-placebo-controls-6320cbc137d4#.4xy954a6h) or the idea that once AD is breached your node will accept any size block. So if you have EB at 2mb and AD at 4 then after 4 blocks of 3mb your node just goes along with any new block size. Now you have to reset your EB to 3mb and so on.
* Permanent chain split and replay attacks/issues
* Adversarial attacks by malicious miners
* Other points mentioned [here](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-bitcoin-unlimited-users-may-end-different-blockchains/)
* Strength and size of the BU development team
* How malleability will be fixed if at all

In short, really understanding how these different settings play out in the real world is not well understood by most bitcoiners. Yes people will have different EB and AD settings otherwise what is the point?? What are the economically rational settings for these knobs?

While BU ""doesn't really do anything"", one could also argue that all of software is about making things easier for people. Before word processors we had typewriters or pencil and paper.  So while it may seem like a small and also important thing to put people in charge of their own destiny, this will no doubt have an impact on security and value of bitcoin going forward. Had we started out with BU originally, we would have learned by now whether it works in the field. However, we did not so we must question this move thoroughly and not hand wave away these concerns.

A lot of the arguments against allowing miners to decide this collectively among themselves  boil down to miners deliberately sabotaging the network, which goes against the central assumption bitcoin is based on (honest miner majority). 
THat's no true, you have to trust that it's trustless, but you don't have to trust anyone.
"Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning. Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning.Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning.Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning.Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning.Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning.

Yeah. I'm sure you'll keep saying it for decades to come. Meanwhile ETH>$18."
"> Blockchain technology is here and fundamentally better than the legacy banking system.

This is like the people who said that digital music downloads are here and fundamentally better than the legacy record label system.

The legacy record labels are making profits hand over fist from digital downloads and have more control over the industry than they had in 1995, just as legacy banks will make profits hand over fist from blockchains.

I agree the tech is disruptive but disruption does not always mean long term improvement for the customer or marketplace.  That is a classic error we technologists make."

Sell your bitcoin and open an account with an AXA bank.
"> How could anyone involved in bitcoin possibly want that to happen.. and why?

Because it feels very bad to be forced to stay married with totalitarian traitors of a libertarian project. That won't be possible. "
"> look theres 2 bitcoins now! 

That won't happen for long. If BU grabs 75% hashpower at some point, the remaining miners will switch out of self-preservation. Core can then deploy their ridiculous PoW change at that point to maintain bitcoin's analog of ""Ethereum Classic"" - something with little hashpower, little if any value, little trading on exchanges, and zero use among dark markets. Not to mention long confirmation times and a stagnant block size

In other words, it won't be 2 bitcoins; it will be Bitcoin with Unlimited as the reference client, and Core's pathetic joke of a CrippleCoin with Keccak that will flame out within days. No Bitcoin user will have *any* reason to use CrippleCoin at that point. Even this idea of ""digital gold"" that Core supporters cling to is perfectly compatible with BU. So is SegWit. So is Schnorr signatures. So is Lightning, etc."

"Blockchain technology is here and fundamentally better than the legacy banking system. If Bitcoin is the implementation that makes the big dent or it is another blockchain is looking very uncertain.

But if Bitcoin keeps failing to give its users what they want, then other blockchains will eat it for lunch. It is already happening, but Bitcoin has a chance to come back with its network effect and brand recognition advantage. But right now Bitcoin is definitely not the best blockchain from a technical standpoint."
You can't be this ignorant unintentionally.
you're ignorant if you think bitcoin splits over such a trivial issue. 
Coding again?
"You don't realise core are team central bankers? 

They're the ones constantly claiming some authority over bitcoin, they're the ones who believe they have a right to set the transaction limit as some sort of central banking economic tool. 

If I wanted a currency run by central bankers with no economic expertise I'd buy naira. "
"Actually, they are. I bet you also think a ""fee market"" needed to be created to save Bitcoin for the future ... Economic illiteracy is a major handicap in dealing with crypto-currencies and probably daily life."
"Bitcoin is not based on trust.

If trust is entering the equation at all, you are doing it wrong.


Do not trust."
"really, the cia knew about btc *and* gavin told us he was going. who was involved in btc slightly before and ramped up afterwards, who is easy to manipulate via politics ort religion, who was known computer hacker? 
all signs say luke or greg is the cia plant"
😘❤️
Does bcoin have some forn of fast block propagation yet?
"Here's my standard take on the supposed ""potential problems with BU"":

Basically, criticisms of BU boil down to doing the following: (1) pretending that people haven't always had the ability to modify their software to choose what size blocks to generate and/or accept; (2) ignoring economic incentives and imagining that people will set their settings in a completely arbitrary and economically-irrational manner; and (3) bikeshedding over the not-terribly-important details of BU's specific Accept Depth logic.  

The reason that criticisms of BU fall apart under the slightest scrutiny is that BU doesn't really *do* anything.  It simply empowers the actual network participants by providing them with a *set of tools.*  More specifically, BU provides three simple configurable settings. These settings allow a user to specify the maximum size block they'll accept (the EB setting) and the maximum size block they'll generate (the MG setting) -- rather than having these limits ""hard coded"" at 1 MB each as they are in Core, which forces a user who wants to change them to modify the source code and recompile. The third setting (AD) provides a simple and *optional* tool (optional because it can be set to an effectively infinite value) that allows you to prevent yourself from being permanently forked onto a minority chain in a scenario where it's become clear that the network as a whole has begun to accept blocks larger than your current EB setting. (Once a block larger than your current EB setting has had AD blocks built on top of it, you begin to consider that chain as a candidate for the longest valid chain.) That's pretty much it.

Or as another commenter explains:

>BU is exactly the same situation as now, it's just that some friction is taken away by making the parameters configurable instead of requiring a recompile and the social illusion that devs are gatekeepers to these parameters. All the same negotiation and consensus-dialogue would have to happen under BU in order to come to standards about appropriate parameters (and it could even be a dynamic scheme simply by agreeing to limits set as a function of height or timestamp through reading data from RPC and scripting the CLI). Literally the only difference BU introduces is that it removes the illusion that devs should have power over this, and thus removes friction from actually coming to some kind of consensus among miners and node operators."
"What potential problems?

It's the usual and boring small blocker nitpicking to stall progress."
FUD, don't make us guess what you think the problems are...
no. they leverage the current Core codebase.
you mean like /r/bitcoin **is**
"FTFU

>A few people have pointed out potential **FUD** with BU. 

honestly what are the problems, - the biggest one that comes to mind is the censorship and false claims over on N Corerea. "
