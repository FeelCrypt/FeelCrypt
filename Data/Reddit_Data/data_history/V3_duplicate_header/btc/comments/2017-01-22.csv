"u/MrRGnome  not to take any offense at your edit in the statement linked below about r/btc being full of trolls, they are free to comment here but unfortunately many of them are fundamentally aligned with BS/Core. 

all critical voices have been banned from r/bitcoin and many other bitcoin discussion channels.

I just wanted to point out that u/nullc ending a rational convention like he did is observed!

"It's not that r/btc is full of trolls, but it does have more than a few hot tempered ""evangelists"" with more ambition than common sense. Some of them I imagine just monitor nullc's user page to pick apart every word he says for posting material.
