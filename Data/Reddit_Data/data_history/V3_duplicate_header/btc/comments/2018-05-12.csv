"Are you still answering questions here? Not sure you are but how and why aren't all BTCs returned to their respective owners who ACTUALLY owned them and then they can decide what to do with them. Selling the coins and paying back the amount of money people lost when BTC was trading at few hundred bucks is nothing short of theft. If I was one of those people I'd scramble as many people as I could and sued to get the ownership of the coins back. This us outright theft x 2. Disguasting.

And I hear you get to keep the difference when those who lost are paid back. Hmmm, let me see. Price of BTC was few hundred bucks back in Mt Gox days. People who got screwed over get paid what they lost and you and the creditors get to keep the difference...of $7000-8000 per BTC. What a F joke. You should be in prison for life for this kind of shit. You never stopped to think that playing Samurai and screwing people out of hundreds of millions of $s wouldn't lead to massive consequences? How you end up keeping even a dime out of this is beyond me. People who got ripped off should get together for a massive counter-lawsuit and demand their coins back! 

What a F joke. And no, it should be clear by now I don't feel sorry for you.  ";1;0;False;crazylittlepartygirl;dyutodu;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89o171/im_mark_karpelès_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/

"Firstly, bitcoin and other currencies have network fees. It’s true that it’s better bc it goes to miners, but then again there’s a near total monopoly on mining, or so there was. So bitcoin isn’t free same like how the banks aren’t fee either. 

Secondly, yes we all hate the banks and they play really dirty. But if you lose your bitcoin it’s not FDIC insured and no one can replace it when it’s gone.  Banks insure your money.

Who said anything about mortgages? I don't think we can do anything but agree to disagree here.

">. And you don't need a network like a bank to make money by lending, that's what bonds are

You do entirely need a network like a bank to issue a bond. Or to buy gold. Or to invest in real estate. This is like explaining the sky isn't purple in financial terms.  A bank is intimately and crucial involved in every step of every financial transaction, although all you see is your brokerage. 

\-They are in charge of issuing the bond, and then they are in charge of the first sale of the bond \(the issuing bank underwrites/buys the bonds, flips them to the first round of investors. Eventually hits your brokerage\)

\-Banks \(or more properly, broker\-dealers\), are in charge of all large scale liquidity of gold futures \(you buy on your brokerage, they are contacting a DMM to buy for you, or a broker dealer, in both cases a bank or near bank\), and physical gold \(banks these days own majority of warehousing of gold, you buy a bar of gold, it's getting ultimately sourced from those warehouses\). Or, that gold mine that mined it? Capital via debt or equity raised by.... a bank.

\-Investing in real estate? If you mean buying a house, that means getting a mortgage from.... a bank. Buying a REIT? That means buying from a broker\-dealer, same situation of above. 

There is quite literally zero investment transactions, outside of micro\-lending nonsense, that are not directly influenced, or only came into existence because, by or of a bank. Aside from off\-exchange crypto, but guess what, that crypto \(these days\) likely touched a .....bank\-capitalized exchange.

"First, I don’t think BTC is the end all of crypto. So I’m not a maximalist in that. 

Second, I saw the tweet with my own eyes. @Bitcoin had a photo of the original BTC white paper and had written above it that BCH is the original bitcoin (who knows how that logic’s works) and that it was mined before BTC. It’s so weird and desperate I couldn’t believe it. 

I totally agree that Bitcoin core is divided and BTC may be surpassed in the future due to their inability to get anything done and evolve. It may be a few years but it could totally happen. 

But, how can BTC not be the crypto currency Satoshi wanted it to be, if he/they designed it? That’s like a contractor designing a house, building it, and people saying “that’s not the house he wanted, though. Not really.”

I understand that fees and speed have removed its ability to be a digital cash currency, and so people are putting up alternatives. I just don’t like people hijacking the words of someone (Sat) and acting like they knew what he meant. 

Make a superior product and the market tends to head that way.

"Your assuming BTC is really 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin'. False assumptions like that are what the troll army tricks people into believing. 

BCH supporters tactics are gentle compared to the corporate assault forces deployed by the Owners of BTC-core. The only reason BCH is doing anything remotely like what your talking about (if any of it is true) and the reason all the social media are a divisive mud-fest is people's attempts to DEFEND against the troll armies' ongoing repetitive attacks on any mention that Bitcoin is flawed or that another coin is better. Every thread is full of hate and lies spread by BTC-supporters (often pretending not to be). Most BCH supporters do not really care if BTC owners switch. Of course we do get satisfaction from it. Mostly, though, I want both coins $-value to approximate their true fundemental value to the world and for new people to know the truth so they don't lose their life savings investing in a coin that has intentionally damaged itself and temporarily keeps it's value up with lies and censorship.

BCH is currently the better coin. BTC could be fixed, but, Core says no to the known solutions so far. I'm not sure if they are trying to make a corporate-owned 2nd/3rd layer super profitable or if they are part of an attempt to destroy or delay crypto adoption while the Banks catch up with their versions of E-Money. Either way, BTC looks doomed to fulfill unimportant use cases and eventually collapse in value. BCH supporters don't need to try to get people to switch. BTC-core has destroyed their marketshare without any need for help from BCH. These days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin' and that idea is still much better than what BTC is currently trying to do. BTC supporters get to call their coin Bitcoin for now due to the Bitcoin code. That is expected to change in time unless they fix their coin (Hard-fork to a much bigger block size?). For now, BTC supporters should be ashamed of their few controlling developers for selling out and should stop claiming (if they even do) that their project is still 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin'.";1;1;False;Big_Bubbler;dyu1e3k;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
