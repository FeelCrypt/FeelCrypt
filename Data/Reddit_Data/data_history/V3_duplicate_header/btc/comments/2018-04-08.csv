"**EDIT**: Troll /u/Spartacus_Nakamoto edited his post. 

He originally questioned ""Why r/btc gives csw a platform"". 

*That implied we shouldn't give someone he doesn't like a platform (AKA PREVENT CRAIG FROM SPEAKING HERE)*, because /u/Spartacus_Nakamoto thinks CSW is a bad person.

He edited it to make it seem like he isn't a pro-censorship, statist troll, after I called him out.


But he's still a troll, just a slimy troll who edits his posts deceptively.

Thank you for a great example of a non-sequitur argument. With a dash of statist censorship and censorship thrown in. You seem to be arguing, ""Why is that bad person allowed to speak? Shut. It. Down. DEPLATFORM!"" 

But nobody's buying it. Go troll somewhere else. 

Free speech means even lying, bad, no good people like you and CSW are allowed to speak. Sorry, but EVERYONE gets a platform, even people you don't like.


I'm personally not a fan of CSW, but to silence or deplatform someone? That's fascism. Go back to your safe space.

And for good reason that it would be an unfair treatment toward part of the creditors and wouldn't be for the good of creditors, which is my point exactly.

Which you have never seen, because if you had you'd know this trial is not about ""cooking the books"" as you so say. I do not think it is smart to accuse people without verifying.

I find it sad however that any group of creditors, no matter how well it starts, ends being driven into this kind of mindset. I think you spend over 10 million yen, but what have you accomplished? I guess you do not think I can be of any use, but is there any point into getting into a confrontation?

I also think you are also misunderstanding my position into any kind of rehabilitation quite a lot. I am not trying to have a central role in anything. I am coordinating with groups which can help in the situation to see how something can be worked out.

"To clarify; 

Our lawyer and the one that filed for CR, who are working in tandem, have both indicated that the sentiment of creditors is a helpful tool in persuading the trustee and the court at this time.

In the future creditors will be called on to vote on a CR plan (hopefully). Most are uninformed and unconnected with the process or its consequences. Our aim of growing the group is to help with both of these challenges. 

You have never offered to send this mail. You alluded and hinted you might, but when it came to it you've always found an excuse not to. This is another example. It's fine Mark, I accept you won't do it. 

Asking the trustee. That's a good idea, I'll ask the Trustee, although we both know he's unlikely to do it. I don't see that you're bound by the same constraints as he is though so you have no reason to refuse. 

You're right. I was trying to get you to send this email. Not by manipulation though, but by stating some unsaid facts. And it's not on my behalf. It's on behalf of 900+ creditors and on behalf of the ones that don't yet know we exist but would like to join it and benefit from it. 

The court is many things but it's not been a practical source of information.

There is strong evidence you cooked the books. There is evidence being cited in your trial against you in which you are charged of embezzlement. And there is evidence you yourself have published. When Jeb told you 80k btc had been stolen from the exchange you as CEO chose not to come clean and tell creditors. Three months later you moved 424k btc in a bid to deflect claims gox was short on reserves. I believe that was a gratuitous attempt to mislead creditors to the state of Gox accounts. At no time did you declare to creditors there was an 80k btc shortfall until after Gox went into bankruptcy.

"Yes of course it’s the narrative pro-BTC users will use. I find it odd that you find that weird? Look, if an official account of Bcash was to be removed from twitter, I would get upset too, because that’s real censorship and everyone deserves to have a voice. The deleted account was named “Bitcoin”, but tweeting Bcash news & information, thus confusing new people which could result in lost of funds.

"It's hardly been hijacked and in no way is it impersonating something.

Everyone who is a Bitcoin Cash supporter today was a Bitcoin supporter before the fork. That includes the owner of Bitcoin.com, the owner of the @bitcoin Twitter handle, and a multitude of others who have been accused of selling out or being compromised in some way. 

Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, performed by Bitcoiners who fundamentally disagree with the roadmap the Core developers have committed to following. Long before scaling was a hot topic, it was widely accepted that in the event that developers or miners ever went rogue, the solution would come in the form of a hard fork.

We may be in the minority, fighting an uphill and possibly impossible battle against what we believe to be rogue developers, but our support for Bitcoin is unquestionable.

"My understanding of Lightning is that if Greg wants to send Adam 1 BTC then they both need to fund the channel with 1 BTC each to do so.

"The only entity with enough collateral to become a **lightning hub** will be a **bank**. That hub will earn profits from channeling payments to other nodes. 

Watchtowers will be able to watch channels and help shutdown nodes to prevent fraud or otherwise. These may also be hidden. Lightning Network deliberately removes the trustless nature of on-chain transactions.

A lightning hub can certainly ""freeze"" assets. If they own enough of the channels, they can just deny the user access. Given that the hub has enough share of the network (LN is extremely centralized) the user couldn't really make much use of their funds.

"Not really. If Greg wants to send Adam 1BTC then they can open a channel where only Greg provides funds, and then Greg makes a LN payment to Adam through that channel.

The problem is if Greg then wants to send Adam more money, or route another payment through Adam, then that channel is unusable until Adam has sent enough money the other way to cover the transaction value.

A payment channel is one stick in an abacus. When you've shifted all the balls to one side, you'll have to shift some balls back before you can do it again, or you'll have to use another stick.

Now extrapolate this to most people's relationship with money, which is one big salary payment once a month, then loads of outgoing payments until the next singular large payment comes in again.

- Core trolls now change the narrative to: ""@Bitcoin was hijacked and was spreading fake news. Roger Ver bought @Bitcoin to spread his scamcoin!"". **This has already happened obviously, but this is going to be the main narrative they're going to push now.**

- @Bitcoin gets turned over to a pro-BTC user connected to Blockstream/LN or disabled for good. Jack probably realizes that if they reenable it to a pro-BTC person, it would be bad PR. So it will remain disabled, and BCH loses its most valuable communication tool to the masses.

Hypothetical future scenario:

- Jack Dorsey, who is invested in LN, in the future implements lightning payments on twitter and take a share of that. They then send information on twitter accounts, transactions and have total surveillance from LN watchtowers. They take a share from twitter users using it, earn money from the collateral and control the sidechain. Services like tippr for BCH are banned on twitter for being bots.

Dorsey did not make a 2.5 Million investment, he was just one of many investors and it was his own private investment, not an investment made on behalf of or by Twitter.

"> The only entity with enough collateral to become a lightning hub will be a bank

**False**. Lightning channels are currently funded by **one party only**. In the future they *will be able to be* funded by both parties, but they don't *have* to be. As such, only the end user needs funds in order to open a channel, **no collateral required**.

Hubs are a fiction entirely created by Lightning detractors.

>That hub will earn profits from channeling payments to other nodes.

**All** nodes with at least one incoming and one outgoing channel earn profits from routing payments.

>Watchtowers will be able to watch channels and help shutdown nodes to prevent fraud or otherwise

**False**. Watchtowers (will, they don't exist yet) perform one function only. They watch the blockchain for the inclusion of a unilateral channel closing of an old state (cheating). When they see this, they broadcast the pre-arranged penalty transaction provided by the other party. They *only* can watch for these cheating transactions if the corresponding node asks them to. If Lightning were centralized, Watchtowers wouldn't be necessary, since cheating would be a legal violation by the bank.

They **cannot** close channels or shutdown nodes.

>These may also be hidden. 

I'm not sure what this even means.

>Lightning Network deliberately removes the trustless nature of on-chain transactions.

**False**. Lightning runs *on top of* and *requires* Bitcoin. It can remove nothing, but it can (and does) add value.

>A lightning hub can certainly ""freeze"" assets. If they own enough of the channels, they can just deny the user access.

**False**. The user would just force close the channel and receive their funds back. There is also nothing stopping them from opening additional channels to other nodes (or even merchants directly).

>Given that the hub has enough share of the network (LN is extremely centralized) the user couldn't really make much use of their funds.

Again, complete nonsense and I don't even understand what you're trying to say.

>Also, there is nothing that hinders fractional reserve banking from existing on Bitcoin.

**False**. Every full node verifies that nobody creates new bitcoin except by the pre-defined rules. Fractional reserve banking is *impossible* on Bitcoin, unless the rules change to allow it (I would never allow such a thing, even if that means my node splits from the rest of the network).

>Tether, who has not yet verified that they have all the 2 billion ""dollars"" they have printed, are essentially doing it as we speak.

"> I've been interested in cryptographic voting for years.

For governance, crypto voting and liquid democracy you may find Decred interesting.

It has an _already working_ system where coin holders have the sovereignty. It remotely resembles liquid democracy in that you either vote directly or delegate your chosen voting preference to a stake pool but can revoke it any moment. The difference is it is not ""1 person 1 vote"" or ""1 cpu 1 vote"" but your power is proportional to your stake, your ""skin in the game"". Therefore easily faked social media accounts or full nodes can ""vote"" whatever they want but the final say comes from real holders. Other difference is you only delegate to cast your choise for you, not to choose for you. Two hardfork votes already took place with 87% and 62% participation respectively. I expect future votes to have decreasing % but it cannot go lower than 10% else the vote has no effect and is restarted.

Vitalik writes extensively about governance, and together with Vlad he criticizes ""on-chain governance"". But the systems he talks about either don't have direct voting in base protocol or worse, are ""promiseware"" projects not yet fully delivered: Tezos, EOS, Casper, etc. For unknown reasons he and others avoid talking about Decred, which is in production for 2 years now.

> most users don't know or care about the things being voted on
