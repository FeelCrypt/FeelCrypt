"u/marouf33 I'm posting here because I'm banned from r/bitocin, the Segwit block by BTC.top was an empty block, most miners don't use the bitcoin network to relay blocks they use the Relay Network, this is a problem as it puts the block ordering in the hands of a centralized network. BS/Core are working to encourage this centralized Relay Network model by developing it further confirmed by adding it to their road map and providing funding to do it.

BS/Core employees ran this network until just a week ago, BTC.top have said they just mark empty blocks with segwit, and while they haven't said it in public it could be deduced BTC.top  does so to avoid being orphaned by the Relay Network.

"The current Bitcoin Core product is based on the hard work of the Bitcoin-Qt developers and team. Most of the hard work you're trying to take credit for was done by the Bitcoin-Qt team between 2009-2014. Blockstream was founded in November 2014 and then they started to employ the most influential Bitcoin Core developers. The Blockstream / Bitcoin Core team's largest contribution is their Segwit proposal. Coincidentally we don't even want it. So stop trying to steal the credit for other people's invention and hard work.

And Satoshi was wrong about that Bitcoin should have only one protocol development team. I still claim that we should have at least 3 competing teams because Bitcoin needs protocol development decentralization just as much as it needs mining decentralization. Blockstream's hostile takeover of the Bitcoin Core project has shown us this need very clearly. ";2;1;False;todu;dd5bs4p;"""One miner loses $12k from BU bug, some Core devs scream.

"People are not the Bitcoin protocol. They aren't decentralized code. Anything that has humans interacting together will eventually form some kind of hierarchy and leadership structure, even if it can morph and change. 

Most times followers aren't consciously seeking out leaders, though sometimes yes. They just follow whoever gets out in front, makes enough noise and somewhat leads, be it poorly or fantastically. 

The Core followers and those who accept r/bitcoin censorship blindly, treat Core, and Greg Maxwell in particular like a leader.  They eagerly await Segwit because he vehemently pushes it, they've been told it is great, and Core/Theymos fear of risk and loss of money propoganda has kept them in line. Those that wake up and get skeptical come here. BU followers on here eagerly await BU and support those in leadership positions. 

The Core devs have much louder and public personalities at the moment, but when the BU team eventually they win the network they would no doubt become more vocal and followed by the community automatically, just as Gavin Andresen was for years after Satoshi Nakamoto passed the torch to him. Satoshi of course was the original. 

I'd say Roger Ver is the closest the r/btc and BU community have to a leader at the moment since he got frustrated, got loud, and started doing something to help. But I imagine he'll be all to happy to go back to being regular Ver once BU takes over just as he was during the Gavin years since his job will be done.

"well, you are right, its lower than .5% but not because my methodology is wrong, but because I was being conservative.

I'm assuming that since release, some % of their work is on blocks that are slightly too large. Since i assume that if a valid hash was found for a block that was too large, there were other too-large blocks which were looked at as well over the past month or so. So whats the best estimate of the % of time wasted on too-large blocks?

Well since we generally assume %hashrate ~ % blocks found, we could just look at valid hashes to see what amount of computational effort was wasted on average.

Since there was 1 valid hash that was for a too-large block, that is obviously the numerator, and the denominator is the total number of BU blocks since its inception.

Since i was lazy, instead of taking 1/(1+total number of blocks mined by BU) i just used the value from the last 1000 which gives 1/197 or .5% of their work was spent on blocks that were actually too large.

since on average a block is mined every 10 minutes and BU has ~20% of the hashrate, that means its more like 1/(.2 * 1.5 * 30 * 24 * 6)~.08% which is now a slight overestimation because BU hasn't had 20% of the hashrate the whole time.

"no...they didn't lose 12k worth of resources. That number was the value of the block which wasn't valid that they thought was.

Each person running BU over the past 1.5 months could be said to lose .005 * (the value they would expect to get by running core on their setup). Which from here looks like: https://alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator

.005 * 1.5 * $18/TH/s = .135/TH/s so multiply this number by your hash rate in TH/s and you get the money you lost in dollars. If you ran a single AntMiner S9 (2.4k dollars) which is the fastest product out there, you would get 14TH/s which comes out to a loss of $1.89";3;2;False;Areign;dd4itpl;"""One miner loses $12k from BU bug, some Core devs scream.

"exactly. That block itself is meaningless because the major part of the bug was to tell the user 'i found a block and now you'll get 13 BTC'  when in reality the block it found was invalid since it was slightly too large and therefor not worth anything.

Its like you are in a real life mine, mining away. You keep finding bits of gold and things go well. One day you find a big chunk that you weigh and say 'wow its worth 12k' but then realize 'shit its only fools gold'. Your buddy says 'oh yeah, that side of the mine is all fools gold, don't go there'. So you rope that part off and your actual losses are just the amount of time you spent in the part of the mine with the fools gold when you could have spent time around the real gold.

So to find the actual loss you have to estimate what amount of processor time was wasted on too-large blocks and multiply that times the average value of processor time.";2;0;False;Areign;dd4squu;"""One miner loses $12k from BU bug, some Core devs scream.

"Hi Greg, 

You're undoubtedly a smart guy. But such comments make me wonder about your worldview. 

I have a few book recommendations (most are short):

- Joseph Conrad - Heart of Darkness
- Tennessee Williams - The Glass Menagerie
- J.D. Salinger - Catcher in the Rye
- Pierre Choderlos de Laclos - Les Liasons Dangereuses
- John Steinbeck - Of Mice and Men
- Niccolò Machiavelli - The Prince

If you haven't read them, or didn't get the point of them, they may be helpful in understanding where the conflict is coming from.

Hopefully you'll pick up at least one of those.

I would have also added Sun Tzu, but I've no doubt you have read and digested that one!

Satoshi knew a hard fork attempt with a second implementation of bitcoin would be a failure, and you are suggesting that we get rid of the team that gets the hard work done, and replace it with 3 teams of failed coders. Good job buddyboy.

>The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.
