">Most people don't think of fraud protection in that way.

That's why I wrote ""sort of"".  I was just pointing out that it prevents a certain amount of fraud, for the seller and for the currency holders. Even if it's not the sort of thing you were referencing.

> I always thought third party services would arise that you escrow your funds with, and when both parties are satisfied, the funds would then be released,

Speaking of off chain solutions, this does exist and works rather well. Even if fees have obviously risen in some cases as a byproduct of congestion in the Segwit chain.

>This is sort of what Lightning is turning into

I notice you say sort of.

Lightning is not simply any escrow service, but built as a second life line to make the SegWit chain viable again as a payment (no longer cash) network by relying on a network of hubs/small banking or exchange institutions. Opening a payment hub is not free and the participants have to keep money in the hub. (the security could be debated, but it's different than with competing miners)

>doesn't have a dispute resolution mechanism that is as good as fiat.

This was probably not what you meant to imply, but fiat doesn't have any built in dispute resolution as such. Same as with most cryptocurrencies so far, it uses second layers for that.

>But you can't have proper dispute resolution and instant transactions at the same time.

True, in the sense that you can't make it a requirement.

"At this point there's a lot of distrust for the development process and virtually all of pro Segwit chain sites have faulty technical information and often manipulative language. They quote Satoshi out of context, then suggest our side of the argument is wrong and that we do it. They also still ban users for even mentioning Bitcoin Cash support.

On the technical side, the errors stem from misleading the public that Satoshi ever considered nonminers full nodes. He didn't and there's plenty of examples saying the opposite. Without that problem, they never could have justified burrying the preplanned scaling plan consistent with the whitepaper by keeping the 1MB limit that Satoshi wanted to raise way past expiration date. This in turn allowed them to argue for going against the definition of a coin by implementing SegWit. Now the chain depends on the development of a 3d party second layer with 3d party payment channels. It could work fantastically well, but none of that is Bitcoin.

Lightning will eventually need larger blocks anyway. Very few people think the block size should be kept at the current size forever, but people just differ on when and how it should be increased. It can be done through a soft fork when needed (though unlike Segwit, it probably should be enforced and not opt-in).

"> Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.

Due to that, I think Bitcoin has failed and I no longer see it surviving long-term, simply due to the fact that there is much better tech out there now in the form of other coins. (Not going to shill any specific coin here.) What do I mean by ""failed""? I got the impression from what I've read from Satoshi that they wanted Bitcoin to be a type of electronic cash and not necessarily only a store of value (see e.g. [this email by Satoshi](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/17/)). Yes, decentralized and trust-less, but still useable for even micro-transactions (from the linked article):

> It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.

Bitcoin seems very much inspired by [Bit gold](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html), which summarizes with:

> In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another. This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation. Bit gold may provide us with a money of unprecedented security from these dangers.

A currency (read: gold) only has value because we, as a society, decide that it does. Gold is a ""good"" store of value because we have currency depreciation with fiat, so storing your long-term value it in doesn't make sense. What happens when (not if) we stop storing our value in physical things like gold and we create a global digital currency that's fast, secure, trust-less, decentralized, and most of all a stable store of value? (Open to hear discussion on if that is even possible.)

A cryptocurrency with those characteristics has all the benefits of gold, without the need for carrying all that expensive-to-move, heavy metal around with you to be able to exchange any of it for goods. And you could exchange on a global scale, something not possible with gold. Banks would be on their way out, because the people would be in control of their own money.

What happens to government-backed fiat when people can exchange their gold like they would fiat? I'd think fiat would start to lose favor. But I'm not sure what affect that would have on world governments and society. (Again, open to discussion because I'm not super well-versed in these subjects.)

Currently, Bitcoin can't do that in its current form—that is, be easily exchangeable for goods—its simply turned into a digitized gold that has the same issues when it comes to exchange—but I think we'll eventually get there with a coin, and there's some promising altcoins that have awesome tech right now. Maybe that coin ends up being Bitcoin after all. Maybe there will be coins, plural, who knows.

Maybe all that is a bit too utopian and it simply can't work on a global scale with governments, etc.";2;0;False;ezekg;dt4t7l4;Stripe Ends Support for Bitcoin Payments;https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support

"I had to personally run around and convince the other devs that the ABC DAA was not so bad and that this wasn't setting a terrible precedent.

When I came into the picture there were 3 fully fledged proposals, the only issue was to pick one.  As I previously stated, its an hours job to make a DAA, its a lot more time to prove that it works well since the problem is basically intractable.  Those other devs created the entire infrastructure to test DAAs and wrote competing implementations (I basically verified their work, added a few tweaks, made pretty graphs and wrote a clear document).

WRT to leadership, Bitcoin Unlimited (Peter Rizun) took the bull by the horns, proposed the UAHF split on Aug 1, and we energized the community.  We did not have the first Bitcoin Cash client because I delegated responsibility to an engineer who subsequently did nothing on the BU Cash client, worked on ABC and neglected to tell me his choice.  I screwed up by not watching him closely, but the BU ""Satoshi's Vision"" conf was just around the corner.  However, I've always wanted there to be a competing large block client so its great that ABC exists.

You won't get any such answers because there are none. I'm am not and have never been involved in any DAA work (other than advising and writing an emulator). I don't care and have never cared which one actually is chosen.

This is why you see me repeat again and again that you have a big disconnect between what you think happened and what actually happened. What actually happened is that a series of individuals were working with one bitcoin implementation and one implementation only.

As such your (and Amaurys) retort that those **unaligned individuals** should not be upset, they should just have released theirs is at best misleading because it makes it look like those individuals had their own bitcoin implementation while they did not.

So, sure, they could have said they would go to another implementation (Classic/BU) and ask them to merge their work and release it. You can ask them why they didn't. My bet is that their answer would be that it just would have made the whole thing worse.

It is, but that's why it's considered Alpha, it works but it needs improvement to scale to a massive size.

Thomas is complaining about Amaury's process of implementing the DAA fix in ABC.

Previously, Thomas had made the point that (according to him) there was already widespread consensus among the ""not-ABC"" devs on a different DAA improvement that was never merged into any of the projects; then Amaury instead went rogue cowboy and implemented his own preferred DAA, which everyone then had to implement in their Cash clients.

My point to Thomas was that, since (according to him) BU, Classic, and XT all came to more or less agreement on a DAA fix a month or more prior to Amaury announcing his fix in Cash -- then BU, Classic, and XT should have just merged *their* preferred DAA fix a month before Amaury announced his, then we would just be using that DAA and not still bitching about the way Amaury proceeded.

"Hi Thomas,

I think I do understand what you're saying, and I don't think that I have misunderstood you.  Let me see if I get this right.

What you are saying here continues to confirm what I understand.  ABC / Amaury / certain individuals took a leadership role in fixing the DAA.  Yourself / XT / Classic / BU claimed to be agnostic to the decision and were not interested in merging a DAA fix provided by ""unaligned individuals"" and releasing it, in other words, you made an active decision to be a follower in this process. 

Please help me if I'm still misunderstanding to this point.

Here then I would agree with Amaury.  If you essentially communicate, ""this implementation isn't going to lead on DAA, you (ABC) go figure it out and we'll implement what you come up with"" then in my opinion your degree of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the decision was reached is unjustified.  ABC is allowed to use any decision process they like, including Absolute Monarchy, just as Classic is free to choose any decision process it likes.  These processes only govern the respective implementations, and shouldn't be confused with being a decision process that governs Bitcoin Cash, the protocol.

Please help me if I'm still misunderstanding.

"it is my opinion and that of many others that nullc is not merely a forceful personality with unusual opinions, but actually a community disruptor / destructor / malactor

in this regard I think such a comparison is quite unfair because I have not seen that sort of disruptive and harmful behavior from Amaury.

however there is far bigger point that I want to make as loudly as possible.  I doubt many people will read this missive buried in this thread but I hope to really reach you if I can.

software repos are little kingdoms by virtue of their emergent organizational structure.  every repo has a king.  that might be a BDFL or an asshole, it might be a puppet who simply blesses the decision of a group, but there's ""a guy"" that has his finger on ""the button"" that, ultimately, decides ""what goes in the code and what doesn't.""

No amount of team structures and decision processes change that fact.  A repo is a fundamentally hierarchical structure, regardless of the nonhierarchical overlays that one might wish to put on top of it.

This is maybe the most important thing I can say to the entire Bitcoin community based on my thirty five years of software development experience and my seven years of involvement with this specific project: you can't decentralize development with a decision process overlay.  Development must be decentralized by having multiple competing / collaborating teams.  There is no other way.

So when you write

> The problem is that we can't do anything about it, other than to encourage him to realize that dictatorship like behavior will result in people leaving just like BTC.

This seems to me to imply that Bitcoin ABC is Bitcoin Cash.  But this is not true.  BU is also Bitcoin Cash.  If BU is robust and well-used in the Cash community, then malbehavior by Amaury should simply result in more people running BU, provided that BU is seen as a complete and robust alternative to ABC.

However, in order for BU to be seen as a robust and complete alternative to ABC, we (the community) need to see *equivalent leadership* from BU that we see from ABC.

So I hope that you understand that I am not being an Amaury fanboi and I'm actually both quite depressed and insulted that you see it this way :( :( :(

Let me back up.

I hope that we can agree that, whatever the faults of the process, that the DAA-fix hardfork was an unmitigated success worthy of many bottles of ""champaign.""  Nothing's perfect but the community managed to decisively hardfork to fix a problem in an amazingly short amount of time and without causing a chainsplit.

Even if something went wrong, the bigger picture is that something went **right.**  Very right.  A ""they said it couldn't be done"" sort of ""right.""

I'm trying to shine a bright light on the thing that Amaury did *right*  so that hopefully the next time something like this comes up, it's BU taking the initiative, not ABC.  The whole community will be made better off if, when the next situation arises, it's ""not-ABC"" taking the initiative and leading the community through the hardfork.  **This is what we really need more than anything** and I would shout it from the rooftops if I could.  This is the most important socio-structural development that can possibly happen to our coin and when it does it will be one of those events whose significance is lost on almost everyone until years later.  **it's that important** please hear me.

If this happens, then we (the community) do not have to worry about Amaury going all nullc, because we can simply turn away from his work product, and towards yours.  But we need to see *decisive leadership.*

Now you might not like Amaury's brand of (IMO) immature decisive leadership (he is after all a young guy) but --- it's still decisive leadership. 

It would be good if Amaury could temper his leadership traits with better interpersonal change management skills but that is something that is learned over considerable time (I speak from experience here :).

While we wait and hope for Amaury to mature, however, we can set an example by becoming better leaders ourselves.

I hope you really take all this to heart Andrew.  I am an enormous fan of BU.  You guys (the original ""alternate BTC implementations"") are truly the heart and soul of the Cash community.  I earnestly hope that we see more community leadership from BU (and XT, and hopefully other clients) in the near future, so that ABC can bee correctly seen as 'one of many' and not some sort of reference or leadership implementation.

There's no point in everyone doing everyone else's job.  In particular, I was working on the gigablock research, and our presentation at scaling bitcoin started the price reversal so this was very important work.

The most important criticism was there was no published analysis of the ABC Daa.  Additionally some other algorithms were claimed to be  better.  I spent a week and published a careful analysis and yes the other algs were marginally better.  But all still could cause chain death and other issues.    ABC merged.  We decided to follow the ABC merge because the algorithm is ok.  End of story.

Nobody is sitting around doing nothing.  ABC took the initiative to make the DAA which is why others did not.  The only problem was the algorithm wasn't sufficiently analyzed resulting in a last minute rush.  We did not want an EDA repeat.

"THANK YOU! I am getting so sick of everybody shitting all over satoshi and making totally crazy statement about where the power lies in the system.

Miners mine as long as there are users making transactions and users buying coins. But you can have a network without users using it, but not users without a network. Therefore just like you said devs have to ask both miners and users what they want, and asking miners is a bit easier and miners should know what is good for users anyway. 
Nakamoto consensus should be understood by EVERYBODY. It's so simple, you vote with hash power, end of story and you vote what is best for the miner - users relationship.

"As I mentioned in another comment that you left, I agree with what you just wrote.  I am not trying to rewrite history.

As you point out, nobody on the other teams was particularly invested in ""doing everyone else's job"" (which implies that you thought it was Amaury's job to fix the DAA.)

Thomas appears to have a persistent beef with the way Amaury selected the DAA.  I do not dispute that Amaury's decision process was somewhat hasty and rogue.  However I admire it regardless.  What I saw is that Amaury did at least some due diligence with known Bitcoin Cash miners to test the ABC DAA.  That may have been insufficient according to Thomas, but it was sufficient to convince the miners as well as the community, because *we did it.*

I would agree that more research and analysis is preferred to less.  However, as you pointed out, apparently nobody thought it was their job to do this research.  And as Amaury correctly pointed out, nobody *was* doing this research, but instead engaging in lots of proposals and discussions.  Help me understand if I'm misunderstanding please.

I don't hear you particularly complaining about Amaury's approach here so you and I don't really have a disagreement.  Thomas is the one who seems very strongly opinionated that Amaury is on a path to becoming Bitcoin Cash's ""nullc 2.0"" and has gone on a bit of a mudslinging campaign which I find tremendously unfair.

I find Amaury's explanation of his decision process to be wholly satisfactory.  According to him, the DAA was a problem that nobody was stepping up to fix.  You and Thomas both have basically agreed with this by stating that it wasn't your priority.  I myself saw it as a casual observer: there was a lot of community consensus that the EDA needed to be fixed, and a lot of debate but nothing was announced, and then Amaury announced his DAA.  Nobody else took the initiative to make a decision, merge code, and declare the new direction.

Instead of complaining about what Amaury did (which could use improvement, but which actually solved the problem) we should instead be demanding that more devs take initiative to fix problems and that more devs should learn from what Amaury did *right* instead of complaining about what he did *wrong* --- because unless I'm mistaken, the DAA fix was actually an incredible display of exactly how quickly the community could rally around a solution and get it implemented with a hardfork and no fallout.

We need to learn from this outstanding and unparalleled success at change management, not try to ""fix"" it too much and go back to old, comfortable ways of debating without taking decisive action....";1;1;False;jessquit;dt3zc10;Bitcoin.org has removed the low-fee part of bitcoin.

"> no known distributed algorithm exists for solving the problem

> these changes can be canceled with payments going in the reverse direction

Consider the typical user who receives a salary once a month and then spends it piecewise during that month.  Most of the time, the payments through his channels will be all in the same direction (out).

> This is multiple orders of magnitude the number of nodes that currently exist, so it's hardly an immediate scale requirement.

The word ""node"" has different meanings in bitcoin and the LN.  In the latter, a ""node"" is just a user.  (In bitcoin, it used to mean ""miner"", but was redefined to mean the non-mining relays added -- without justification -- after Satoshi left.) 

It is hard to estimate the number of active of bitcoin users, but optimistically they are several million.  Thus a million nodes is what the LN should handle *now*.

Moreover, the LN is meant to let bitcoin scale, faster than Moore's Law; so what matters is how it would handle hundreds of millions of users, not a few thousand.

> But it's several times better than miner and node scaling, which is what matters. 

A path finding node in the LN will need to handle **more** traffic and do **more** work than a miner would do in bitcoin, for the same amount of payments.  That's because each LN payment will require 5-10 channel payments.  That will quite likely cancel the reduction in traffic due to the use of intervals.

> ou can also have light LN clients that behave similarly to SPV.

Only if they delegate path finding to some (ahem) trusted service.  

Note that the owner of that service may screw users by routing paths through several middlemen nodes that belong to him.

> Only the capacity change, which can be fuzzed and has no reason to include the sender or receiver of the transaction (which isn't even known with onion routing).

Onion routing will only hide the IPs of the computers who are sending the messages.  Still, the path finders will know about all path payments that they are asked to find, and about any significant payments done anywhere in the network.

When Alice buys an RPG from Zoe's hobby shop, the path finder that Alice consulted will know that LN node 111552 made an LN payment of about $1200 to LN node 552551, which went through nodes 230001, 333111, and 404040.  And every path finder in the world will know that payments of about $1200 went through the channels 111552-->230001, 230001-->333111, 333111-->404040, and 404040-->552551.  

Path finding will not be possible if that  information is obfuscated.  Once the KGB (who will happen to be running that path finding service) determines that node 111552 is Alice and node 552551 is Zoe...

> >  A failure rate of 1% may be high enough to drive users away.

> That just means that occasionally a payment takes 2x or 3x the amount of time to happen. Since usually payments will take a few seconds that means a 3x delay takes maybe 10 or 15 seconds, I don't think anyone will stop using the system because of that. 

No, ""failure"" means the system will not be able to find a working path between you and the merchant, even though you still have enough funding left in your channels.  If that happens once every 100 payments, people wil not use it.

> > the selected middlemen nodes must ""freeze"" the relevant channels until the payment is negotiated and executed, or the negotiation fails.

> This only takes a few seconds. 

We shall see.  The nodes in a K-hop path must exchange K messages (or maybe 2K or more, not sure) and the messages may use onion routing.

If two path finders choose to use the same middleman X at the same time, one of the paths will fail.  This is likely to happen many times if X is near a popular user, like a shop.  

If there are (only) a million users, each making one LN payment per day, there will be ~50 LN payments per second happening, which may mean 200 channel payments per second.  Many of these channel payments will have to be broadcast *promptly*, as separate messages, to all path finders.  

> Why do you think this is a significantly different from BGP routing on the Internet?  

Internet routing is a completely different problem from finding payment paths in the LN.  For one thing, there is no concept equivalent to the balance of payment channes, and no need to broadcast information about every packet hop to every gateway in the world.  Internet packets travel one hop at a time: there is no need to negotiate the entire path from scratch, with all gateways, before sending each packet.  Each telecom company that owns and operates a part of the physical network has a central server that knows the IPs of its users and how to phisically reach them; and it will send packets addressed for other IPs to other telecom companies that it has gateways to. 

More generally, the LN has no concept of physical network.  It abstracts the internet as a complete communications network: that is, it assumes that sending a **message** from any user to any user is an atomic operation.  Even so, a suitable path finding algorithm for the LN is still missing.";1;1;False;jstolfi;dt39b6y;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.
