"My point is this:  the system can only function with block rewards, the notion that they can be cut in half 10 more times, or be eliminated entirely is preposterous.  

There is no, and cannot every be, a ""happy sustainable endgame"" for any cryptocurrency that I know of.  If there was an exception I'd change colors in a minute and hop right on board, but I've looked around, and all I find are pie-eyed dreamers like yourself.

"Thanks for the link to this exchange, it was very informative.  Just for the record, while I think the name calling didn't do either of you any favors, when it comes to the substance of the disagreement, gizram84 was slightly more convincing to me given that it didn't seem like you had a good response to the fact that both your solution and the LN require a middleman, but yours requires a certain level of trust in that middleman.

Now like I said, I'm just slowly trying to educate myself on the fundamentals of various scaling solutions, and frankly I retain a lot of skepticism that Bitcoin can scale and simplify to the point that a normal person can use it without understanding it or putting their faith in a third party.  And it is very likely that I don't have a firm enough grasp of the basics yet to grok either position, but I thought I'd comment anyway to give some feedback on how this looks to one pair of outside eyes.

"A recent example of exactly that situation coming up was the [Parity multisignature wallet hack](https://blog.ethcore.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/). Due to an embarrassingly stupid bug in the Parity muiltisignature wallet, a hacker made off with $32 million worth of Ether - remarkably close to the value that the TheDAO hacker grabbed (though a much smaller percentage of the total market cap). Since there was no time delay, the hacker ran off with the Ether immediately and laundered it off to exchanges and whatnot.

There were no serious calls for a TheDAO-style fork to recover it. I suspect due to a combination of the lack of a grace period and due to having learned hard lessons from the TheDAO fork.

IMO, the existence of Ethereum Classic makes me trust the main Ethereum chain more.

So you need Vitalik to come to the aid of your hurt egos...??  I think he has better things to do and you guys are so smart you should be able to stand up for yourself.  Meanwhile, at the same time you merrily put shit on Vitalik and Eth.  Such as :

> Whatever it talks to prop up the value of his vast quantities of premined coins

Jealous??  Really, why the hell would he say a kind word about you when you and your cronies have spent plenty of time sounding off at Eth and him - you have probably cost a lot of people the opportunity to get into Eth on the ground floor because they listened to your inane rantings and attempted discrediting of it.

>  dishonest descriptions of an immutable world computer which is not immutable nor a ""world computer"".

Says you.  At least they are innovating and there are a lot of big tech interested - who presumably have competent engineers assessing the potential - but you know better.

> Perhaps promote etc or express some loud doubts about the ethics and legaility of the ethereum foundation's actions or about ICOs he's been involved in breaking securities law

From what little I know about it I think Vitalik has stepped back from the ICOs as they used him to give credibility to their floats but did not ask for or take his actual advice.  This is somewhat of a new frontier and it is entirely unsurprising that there are people playing fast and loose.  But you seem to be merely trying to tar Vitalik with the same brush as what might be applied to some of the people pushing the ICOs

> But he's so concerned that rbitcoin's confining bcash posts to a single thread is dire censorship.... ooohkay.

Yes - darn right ooohkay.  Your tactic is to throw mud in return and **not** to answer the statement.  A mature person might have been able to acknowledge Vitalik's fair and reasonable, and might I add, quite understated observation.

It *is* an underhanded tactic to get control of a Bcash forum and then re-label everything about Bitcoin Cash as BCash in order to fool some of the people to going to the wrong forum where BCash is criticized.  This is the same dirty, unethical, nasty tactics that have been in play all along.  **The fact that you don't call it out, can't call it out and won't call it out just shows what a weak character you are**.  Throwing a bunch of nasty comments doesn't make what is happening on r|bitcoin right even if there should be any grain of substance in them.

Just like Bitcoin, Ethereums issuance is goverend by a mechanism that inflates the currency but at a depreciating rate over time.

The only difference between the two is that in the end game Bitocoin's protocol stops at 21 Million as a hard limit, where Ethereum just lets the tail ride out. At that point either currency is just generating a little dust. The last BTC ever created will take *decades*, so the 21 Million limit is kind of useless. Ethereum just lets the dust generation continue, but losses will probably make it deflationary as Vitalik has noted before.
