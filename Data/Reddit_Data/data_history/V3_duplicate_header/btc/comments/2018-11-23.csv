"I would say what we're discussing is whether Charlie Lee was rightly blamed or not.

I disagree about your framing of how it went down, insofar as you argue that pro-BCH people criticized him for not selling and now we're bitching about him selling because it's a bear market. I think a more correct framing of the problem is that his actions as an individual completely contradicted his advice given as project creator, which is manipulation.

Correct me if I am wrong: You are now arguing that because it's a bear market now, Charlie Lee is being criticized for having bailed by selling off at a peak. You may have a point here, but really it's a small aspect of the criticism so I don't think this argument dispels the criticism of him overall.

The only reason this is being brought up now is because of the extreme bear market. If the bull market continued and LTC was 1k *do you think this would still be brought up?*.

"Who cares?

Yeah, Lee was always just a cash grabber, and Litecoin was the very first cash grab fork, that added literally nothing compared to Bitcoin. It didn't innovate, didn't expand, didn't improve, it just sped up and copied the original. 

I mean, congratulations to him, he's rich now off creating the very first pointless shitcoin. Well played. 

I don't care, though. It has no bearing on cryptocurrencies as a whole. ";1;0;False;cr0ft;eaa9t2c;Friendly reminder that the LiteCoin ($36) founder sold 100% of his coins as it ran up to $300 while wearing a HODL shirt for video interviews.;https://i.redd.it/765flc1o5wz11.jpg

No it wasnt fucking obvious. You say this aftermath, but at the time nobody knew where the top is. Everybody knew it was maniac but it kept breaking the record every time someone made a top prediction. LTC might have gone $2000 and Charlie could have been criticized less. If the mania phase was over when ETH was at $8, Vitalik could have been claimed part of the pump-and-dump scheme. ;2;2;False;bow_chika_wow_wow;ea9o78r;Friendly reminder that the LiteCoin ($36) founder sold 100% of his coins as it ran up to $300 while wearing a HODL shirt for video interviews.;https://i.redd.it/765flc1o5wz11.jpg
Like i said everybody knew the market was unsustainable but nobody could correctly tell when the maniac phase was gonna end. Because if you did someone could have shorted the hell of it and became a billionaire. But in reality, anyone who shorted along the irrational bull run got rekt. So my point is the timing Charlie had chosen to sell is *not* something “that could have been seen from a hundred miles”. Of course, Charlie was damn lucky to have timed it right, but salty bagholders are going to be salty, and their sentiment is completely understandable. ;1;1;False;bow_chika_wow_wow;eaa565k;Friendly reminder that the LiteCoin ($36) founder sold 100% of his coins as it ran up to $300 while wearing a HODL shirt for video interviews.;https://i.redd.it/765flc1o5wz11.jpg
