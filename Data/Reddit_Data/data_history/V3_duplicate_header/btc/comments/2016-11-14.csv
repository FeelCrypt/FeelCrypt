In every scenario where XT has enough support to be controversial, Core by definition has enough non-support to be controversial.

The massive externalized costs of implementing Segregated Witness far outweigh the cost of performing a hard fork — and all of this for a mere 0.7MB “effective” increase in block size. Let’s not forget that Bitcoin Core’s insistence on SegWit was intended as a measure to avoid using a hard fork to increase the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network. SegWit activation will enable Bitcoin Core to keep refusing an actual block size increase and bitcoin’s death march will continue.;5;1;False;32mb4life;da0gdam;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9

The other is the mods completely removing any discussion mentioning the things they don't like so no one gets to see it or discuss it going forwards.

"Regarding the early history - when Theymos defined XT as an ""alt-coin"", because it provided much bigger blocks:

By that definition, many changes to Bitcoin could be considered an ""altcoin"":

- XT, Classic, BitPay's Adaptive blocksize, etc. - all making a change to the blocksize

- SegWit - making a massive change in the data structures, requiring rewriting nearly all wallet and exchange software

- Lightning - making a drastic change to Bitcoin's network topology

This shows that their definition of an ""alt-coin"" is total bullshit:

- They classify a *minimal* change (increasing the blocksize), as an ""alt-coin""

- They classify a *gigantic* change (rewriting all the software, drastically changing the network topology) as ""Bitcoin""

**Dude, excellent work and write up!!!**

The entire Bitcoin community has to condemn this. Otherwise, they support the  censorship tacitly and by that harming/betraying Bitcoin.

wow, fantastic work!  i've wondered whether some smart, dedicated individual could/would document just a fraction of the censored posts and bans that have taken place over the last year and a half or so.  that's a brutal and damning list that should be archived for posterity.  such a shameful, disgusting situation created by small blockheads and core dev.  those guys deserve to be ostracized from Bitcoin.;42;2;False;shmazzled;d9zhx08;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
"Wow, a long needed summary post I feel, and an important post that people need to see, I'm not really ""pro big blocks"" especially but I just find it heartbreaking to see the censorship.. if big blocks are such a naff idea then lets just openly discuss and debate and reject it... even more heartbreaking as most casual bitcoin observers don't realize how bad it is.

So I want to do my part, I made this advert: http://coinad.com/?a=Ad&b=IGX2J4DJIRF45 , self funded it with 0.1btc ($70). It will display 1 million times right across all of these websites: http://coinad.com/?a=Advertise (A LARGE selection of the worlds leading free bitcoin faucets and games - our games and incentive sites alone, we gave out around 900btc+ over the last 2 years) - no these users probably aren't bitcoin CEOs and silicon valley VCs, but they are the NEW, grass roots bitcoin users, claiming their first free micro bitcoin units and learning what it is and how it works..

I previously reached out to u/MemoryDealers to see if there was any interest in taking ongoing ads with us (I'm the owner of coinad.com) to r/btc or to bitcoin.com but without response.. I'm optimistic and interested to see the results, and if they are positive - if people really click through and want to read this information then I'd love to try and work out an ongoing way to showcase this side of things.";45;2;False;bitcoinalien;d9zkcuj;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
