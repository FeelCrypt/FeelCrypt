Agreed. Although the final story is not in. In case you haven't noticed, we have a major hard fork coming November 18 that could wipe out both SW chains causing a huge rush into BCH as a safe haven.

You can undo it with a hardfork. The HF would forbid output to new SW addresses, but it would still enable spending of existing SW outputs.

> unupgraded clients see them as valid transactions

Miners using old nodes can produce invalid blocks. This is not a problem. If you are mining, you better update the software, and then there is no risk. If you are not a miner, it doesn't matter what you node believe.

"The idea of ""code as law"" has no backing. The entire point of blockchain is **consensus**, not immutability. If everyone in the system agrees to remove something from the blockchain, then it's completely valid, because blockchains aren't about immutability, they're about coming to consensus and agreeing about the state of the blockchain.

I'd agree if the funds were just lost due to user error, but weren't. Someone straight up stole them. We wouldn't put up with that anywhere else in the world, so why would we let a malicious party get away with it on a blockchain? It's not because ""blockchains are immutable!"", because that is **not** the point of blockchains.

In this case, ""justice"" was enforced by a direct democracy. There were no guns or nuclear bombs. The majority of people agreed that the thief didn't deserve what they took and that letting the thief keep what they stole would destroy the Ethereum ecosystem, so the majority undid the actions of the malicious party.

"> Some Core supporters believe small blocks are integral...

Here is the problem. Why can only *they* determine what is a ""small block""? There were discussions allowing blocks up to 1GB or higher. One of the simplest plans was a one time increase to 20MB, so even SegWit2x where people are pulling out their hair and jumping off bridges is *way* smaller than that. SegWit2x is very small to people who believe blocks should be unlimited.

Then there is the other side of the question. Why is 1-4MB not too big?? What if some people think blocks should be much smaller than that? (Yes, actually some people DO believe that). Why is it that only Core can say EXACTLY what is small and what is big? The truth is they can't. They're just stubborn and unwilling to work reasonably with others. THAT is the real problem.

"There was nothing new in that.   It claims that Bitcoin is only valuable as a new asset class to replace gold, and for a variety of reasons pushing Bitcoin to a $7.5B valuation is a terrible idea.

""Truly useful"" to me means as a new substrate for transactions, able to replace a very substantial fraction of transactions.  Bitcoin both don't have the scaling technology, and have a basic structure that is in the way of this (the mining payout structure set up is in the way, and confirmations are *way* too slow.)

I think it is possible for a different coin to grow to actually work for this, though nobody has released one with the appropriate properties.  I don't think it is possible for Bitcoin to grow to do this.

In what way do you consider Bitcoin ""truly useful""?  To me, it seems to have ended up primarily a speculative asset with a bubble structure, and to a small degree something that is used to facilitate some small amount of international money transfers and trade that's otherwise illegal.

"Okay, first lets dispel this myth that blockstream controls core. It does not. The [last core release](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0.1) had over 90 contributors from all over the globe, with almost all of them having no affiliation with blockstream. The lead maintainer, Wladimir J. van der Laan, who ultimately decides what changes get merged, also does not work for blockstream. You can not provide any reasonable evidence that blockstream controls core, particularly for their own benefit, at the expense of the users. It's a silly conspiracy theory.

Second, a hard fork, specifically for a capacity increase, is literally in the scaling roadmap. So how is it that either core or blockstream (however you wish to conflate the two) is against a hard fork when [over 60 core contributors have endorsed it](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/21/capacity-increase/)?

"> but the AsicBoost thing needs to be fixed,

Asicboost is a relative nonissue.  Despite the claim that it is being used and was blocking segwit, no one has been able to find any statistical evidence that it was ever used.  In fact Maxwell claimed a very specific use of asicboost was prevented by asicboost and therefore was why segwit was being blocked.  I wrote a script that searched across many thousands of blocks for evidence of that specific use and came up with nothing.

Segwit doesn't fix asicboost, it only makes the specific merkle-branch swapping method that Greg suggested was being used un-viable.  I also couldn't find any other evidence of asicboost being used.

Fixing asicboost requires a hardfork.  The segwit2x team has already had discussions on how to fix it in a proper hardfork (later date), and Bitmain already gave their consent for asicboost to be fixed as an olive branch to bring the community together.  Naturally, Core ignored the olive branch.

If the bug had been in Ethereum itself then it would have been reasonable for the bug in Ethereum to be fixed.  But that's not what happened.  The bug was in the ""contract"" and all the people who lost signed on to the contract.   If they were fools, then they deserved to lose their funds. 

What I saw was that the people in charge of Ethereum did not believe in their own philosophy.  And worse, when they violated their philosophy they did this for their own personal benefit.

It would have been, IMO, a wonderful thing if all those funds had been lost.  It would have made it crystal clear that there was a future for smart contracts and ""code as law"" rather than our present system of ""justice"", which ultimately is enforced by guns and nuclear bombs, despite all the blather about democracy.

"> Really how a decentralised dev could have forced a contentious soft fork?

You get a portion of the miners (even a minority thereof) to orphan rather than extend the last block if-and-only-if it didn't follow the stricter rules (the softfork).

This has a chance of incentivizing everyone to follow the stricter rules, because if they didn't it would increase the chances of getting their blocks orphaned. 

Different devs can even try to convince different fractions of miners of doing the same with different and perhaps mutually incompatible softfork ideas. And the miners would vote with their hashpower by orphaning or extending blocks. :-)

This differs from a hardfork, because hardforks are a loosening of the rules. Orphaning blocks that *aren't* as strict wouldn't work unless you already had a majority of the hashpower, and then it automatically leads to a split chain, not a gradual conversion of the chain.";-3;2;False;ArisKatsaris;dofssfw;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

I'm not ""making it sound like that"", that's just reality.  

> You totally try to sweep under the rug that they have the full support of the big block community and the thousands who have been banned in r/Bitcoin

Ok, so the same community that supports BCH?  I'm not too concerned.  That's an insignificantly small number of users that don't represent a large economic position.

> That futures market is another demo of corruption at bitfinex. It's biased.

People like you just need a way to justify in your head why the BT2 token is trading at such a low price.  So you come up with fictitious ways in which it must be ""biased"".  It's called cognitive dissonance.  You can't simultaneously believe that the 2x fork is going to succeed, but also see that the price is trading so low.  So you concoct a fantasy scenario in which the BT2 token must be biased.  It's kind of funny.

The reality is that the [token constraints are not biased at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/763c5q/the_official_ticker_for_bcore_altcoin_has_been/dob67hf/).  The reason why the price is so low is because no one wants 2x.

> Depending on the state of BTC after the fork, they may represent the best of all BCH hodlers. 

The BCH price can't be improved by Coinbase releasing their millions of BCH tokens.  Right now, all of those tokens are essentially being ""held"", as you put it, the ""best of all BCH holders"".  Once Coinbase releases them, at least some of those people will sell.  So the price can only go down.  The only way this scenario doesn't affect the price of BCH is if every single Coinbase BCH recipient continues to hold, without exception.  I think we both realize how unlikely that is.

"The thing is:

Blockstream themselves *created* the rift of ""contentiousness"".

They were also the ones who introduced the term ""contentious"" to the scene, accusing all new implementations of it. Remember when they started slinging around the term ""contentious"" like crazy, starting with XT when it was gaining momentum? That's when it began. I had never heard the term in the Bitcoin space before that moment. Then it was like wildfire.

Blockstream, in cahoots with theymos, divided the community with censorship by utilizing theymos' control over discussion platforms, and then *manufactured the rift* between the two sides which they then pointed at in cries of ""contentiousness"". **They created the contentiousness.**

It was all fabricated by one group. I hope we expel them soon.

I think when they are gone and (if) their censorship is no more, both sides can come together once again. But that will require the manufactured and continually upheld rift between both sides to be dissolved. Again: one company is creating this situation. Blockstream.

The SegWit implementation was planned in two steps. First as a softfork, and then as a hardfork. The advantage of first doing it as a softfork was that you didn't need to do the header refactoring at the same time (which would add more complexity to the fork).

See here's the thing. A handful of developers, and 20 to 30 Reddit fanboys is what you're referring to when you say ""mass agreement"". 

You probably don't realize that. So before you disagree, hear me out:

That particular subgroup was okay with the fork you're referring to.  And it went well because that particular subgroup has control over the repository. 

They decide what gets approved and what doesn't. So if they don't agree, they can create the perception that there's mass disagreement.  And maliciousness. 

What you're seeing ***now*** is actually mass agreement. Major companies with millions of users, large mining groups, and tens of thousands of individual users expressing an opinion.

I think the BTC has been taken over by coin holders. They are less interested in progress. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a high focus on improved functionality and scalability. It is not targeted to holders, but to users. Because of that, it is easy to get consensus for protocol upgrades.

And then, if a protocol upgrade turns out to be contentious, what is the problem? Let the market decide!

"The real contradiction is it's usually the same idiots posting ""why all these different opinions"" as who complain ""wow ur all a hivemind"" when there's general agreement.


Usually it's just noise/trolling, but occasionally it's someone legitimately too stupid to graduate from diapers.

"> Crypto is a serious threat to fiat, we all agree on that.


I don't agree on that. 


The wealthy are the same no matter what medium you're in, and there are plenty of rich people trying to control Bitcoin. Rich people tend to end up coming to an understanding with statists, and statists won't let crypto undercut fiat. The closest it'd ever get is getting subsumed into fiat.


The population at large doesn't care and won't blink when crypto is regulated - hell, there's proof of that already. Try operating an exchange without a license, see how much outrage gets generated when you get locked up.
