"Agreed. There's no resistance to hard fork in our parts and we can build this in wonderfully. And the Core resistance to it will prevent them from adopting beautiful and simple solutions like this one.

The protocol can designate a canonical ordering, for instance you could order them from smallest input to largest, and if a transaction is discovered that requires a previous input not found in that block, discard it for the next block.";20;3;False;Anenome5;dpez5rz;“Graphene” is a new Bitcoin block propagation technology that is *10x more efficient* than Core’s “Compact Blocks”!

"> I was told there would need to be a hard fork to establish this ordering. 

Why? If following a particular order makes their blocks faster to propagate, miners have a strong incentive to do so. They would only not follow it if they have a very good reason for, which they should be free to. There's no need to force the ordering on the protocol level.

"No offence, but I did not read it before.

Besides my idea offered is a bit more reliable than their bloom filters because my idea doesn't create any false positives. But I wouldn't call it my idea, I just applied general filesystem deduplication scheme to bitcoin blocks. Every block as one dedup record with ranges from sorted by fee and txid mempool. With bloom filter a false positive is possible, we would just sha256 the provided range of mem pool and compare it on every node. If node doesn't have the tx then it either waits or consumes txs until the hash and range matches. Range check is for protection against possible exhaustion attack (ie sending blocks with random hash, or sending blocks with random ranges and hashes). So block would include total number of included transactions, range of mempool and sha256 of that mempool range txs as if they would be in final block. As the mempool is ordered we can also create an auxilliary command in case of timeout to check the synchronicity of mempools. Something like range by range check of hash to find a missing transaction.";8;2;False;Ikinoki;dpf8g64;“Graphene” is a new Bitcoin block propagation technology that is *10x more efficient* than Core’s “Compact Blocks”!

"I'd agree with you if you weren't right. Let me explain.

It can be made as a soft fork, but then you might have some nodes not updating and those nodes would then make those who are updated unable to use this propagation scheme.

You can even do this without forks altogether, by simply agreeing between the big miners that you'll use a specific transaction ordering and do it entirely voluntarily.

The difference between doing it in one of those ways and doing it as a hard fork which forces it on all of the nodes who voluntarily wish to remain participants, is that you can now safely make assumptions and base code on those assumptions.

There is alot to be said about knowing with certainty how the protocol works, and soft forks branches out the number of ways the system functions making it harder to optimize.

Would I want everything to be voluntary? yes, of course.
But what I'm trying to say is that even with hard forks that forces rule changes, it **IS** voluntary. Nodes **chooses** to participate after the changes by their own decision.

"> With a hard fork, we could make the ordering of transactions a part of the consensus rules, forcing 100% of all nodes to have identical ordering 

Hi, not an enemy, just a guy looking for a good discussion.

If you stop and think about the language you used, isn't a better way to say it

> With a hard fork, we would agree that the ordering of transactions are a part of the consensus rules, enabling 100% of all nodes to have identical ordering

The reason I say this, is that it's an important perspective change.

In a hard fork, end users voluntarily agree to alter their consensus rules to get the desired benefit. Nobody ""makes"" or ""forces"" anything - the network is permissionless with no authority to mandate change.

Once you look at it this way you see the subtle but extremely important aspect of a hard fork, and that is that it is always a noncoercive voluntary change made by the user who always has the choice not to go along.

Having said all that, wouldn't the proposed change be classified as soft fork since it makes previously valid blocks invalid under the new rules?";2;1;False;jessquit;dpf8nmx;“Graphene” is a new Bitcoin block propagation technology that is *10x more efficient* than Core’s “Compact Blocks”!

"With ordering it's much cheaper and basically limitless. Otherwise applying a compression method on the mem pool is possible but it won't be as effective.

In my case...

I'll read more on graphene. I'm not sure I'll be a great addition to the team as I'm not experienced in c++ at such level but in case of logical mind benders I'm all in to help. Actually I thought such basic CS algorithms are already implemented in bitcoin client. Now that you opened my eyes i see there's a lot of work possible to improve it more.

I see currently transactions are sent from address to address and blockchain grows due to that, i remember i read about blockchain snapshotting but i see no implementation of that.

"Thinking of soft/hard forks as a tightening/relaxing of the rules is something I've found weird for a very long time.

Sure, if we hard forked and changed PoW to Scrypt, previously invalid transactions (those hashed with scrypt on a sha256 network) would become **valid**, and you could call that a relaxation of the rules; but in fact it's just a change in ruleset.

If we **have** to put forks in relation to a tightening/relaxing scheme, then you have **THREE (3)** types of forks.

1) Soft fork: rules are tightened only 
2) Hard fork: rules are relaxed only
3) ???? fork: rules are both relaxed and tightened, such that the tightening (soft part of the fork) is enforced across the network due to the bundled relaxated part (the hard part of the fork).

This way of thinking however, just makes a mess in my head. To me, a hard fork is a fork in which users have to upgrade to keep participating, and a soft fork is a fork in which you may choose to not upgrade and still participate.

"Holy fuck i had that idea yesterday!

Thought to write a bip about that.

Lol. I thought we always receive blocks in format of txid in mempool but recently i found out that we receive full blocks. I was like ""wtf!? It's like sending a full file when you have most parts of it""

Wow.

Here's another idea then. Instead of sending the txids we can create an ordering algorithm which creates a hash for the mem pool matching instead of even transferring txids. Then worst case scenario you will need to download a graphene block, best case scenario just match transactions in the pool with a hash which is the only thing with offsets that is sent. It takes away the flexibility of picking and choosing which transactions get added to the block though.

Yeah, requiring blocks to use a canonical ordering of transactions seems like a soft fork-type change. But I don’t even see why that’s required.

I think you got that slightly wrong. 1/10th is when you don't need to send ordering information. For this to happen there needs to be a canonical order of the transactions that includes dependencies between unconfirmed transaction. I was told there would need to be a hard fork to establish this ordering. Since this is Bitcoin Cash I see no reason for that not to happen.;31;2;False;30parts;dpeyzsf;“Graphene” is a new Bitcoin block propagation technology that is *10x more efficient* than Core’s “Compact Blocks”!

"I think a canonical ordering can be introduced by soft-fork:
the current rules require transactions to be ordered when they depend on each other, this creates a partial ordering on a couple of the transactions - we keep this rule. The (many) remaining ambiguities can be resolved by ordering the remainder by hash value, which would be a tightening of the rules - a soft fork.

yeah even i'm a little surprised that why wouldn't he consider ordering of the blocks which as far as i know is essential to make some transactions valid if not all. Maybe we don't need ordering of all the transactions but a few transactions and for the rest we could use canonical ordering.

"Yes. But IBLT allows you to send the data proportional to the size of the difference of the mempool instead of the size of the block.

Roughly speaking the idea is this: I want to send you 1000 key/values. I know you already have 999 of those key/values, but not which 

I add all keys together, and all values together and send you SUM(keys), SUM(values). 

You then substract your 999 keys from SUM(keys) and 999 values from SUM(values); you then have the missing key/value and can construct the 1000 key/value block.

Now IBLT works like this, but instead of creating 1 such sum it creates *n* such sums and puts each key/value in some of those *n* depending on a hash. If *n* is more than the expected difference between you and me; you can reconstruct the  set in one round-trip";11;0;False;tomtomtom7;dpf5d3r;“Graphene” is a new Bitcoin block propagation technology that is *10x more efficient* than Core’s “Compact Blocks”!

Without a hard fork, the peers have to agree on an ordering scheme, or transmit the ordering of the transactions.

Yes, I am. Which is why I want 2X to win.

I don't hate you. I do not hate Core. By saying so you are either ignorant or a liar. I just dislike a lot of what you both say and do.

">You realize that they bash us too, right?

Yes - both places are toxic.

/r/bitcoin is the worst, but that doesn't mean /r/btc is good. It just means /r/btc is less bad than /r/bitcoin. 

I'm telling you to not attack. Be the better man\coin. I don't think the attacks does anything good except create a toxic place. It won't correct anything. Core will be Core. They control the Bitcoin code. They are super villains in disguise, but it doesn't matter. As long as we own Bitcoin we accept their actions.

It is really interesting to see you trying to make your actions about my lack of heart. It's just a damn coin. Some money. Why do you care so much? How have you managed to make some peoples vision of a product into an attack on you as a person? You should calibrate your priorities in life. Your anger is like that of a child. Are these the actions of a level-headed adult in your opinion?

Don't forget that I was fed the same lies as you. I am not an outsider. I mainly post in /r/btc as well, but I am getting tired of the bitter people spreading toxic propaganda instead of trying to build a good community that can make a better tomorrow. 

Trumpesque victimization really isn't the way to go.

The statistics of the frontpage shows us 44 % of posts here is crap. They do not add any value anywhere. Those posts will not make Core close their code factory. It will not make Blockstream stop taking bankers money. It will not make people stop buying Bitcoin - hell, most of you own Bitcoin it seems as well. The toxic crap is only pushing good people away from this place and it adds fuel to the fire of hate that burns inside you and many others like you. Why do we want a community that is fueled by hate? It makes no sense. 

Just to clarify something: I do not dislike you. I do not dislike the big block chants you come with. I dislike the Core hate you spew. 

So to answer your question about ""*Literally, what the fuck have we done wrong!?*

You've started an attack that is only taking out civilians instead of the intended target. And you've kept firing. The civilians... the new people to this war... they've said what they thing about your behavior. It is in Top:All in this sub.

"> I mean threads bashing things Core has been doing and saying why it is bad.

You realize that they bash us too, right? And you realize who started this whole thing, don't you? It was not us. 

And you realize they have a censored echo chamber where they bash us all day and do it in such a way that we can not even defend ourselves because they have banned us from replying? How can you not see who the bad guy really is here?

Why don't you take a second to realize that you are rubbing salt in the wound of the people who have already been pretty badly screwed over. Realize that every single thing you say about us, is what you SHOULD be saying about our opponents. We are not the attackers, we are the ones that are being attacked. 

So what you are doing is kicking us while we are down, rubbing salt in the wound, lemon juice in the cut. The wound is the fact that propagandists have very unethically and unfairly taken over the narrative and are pushing lies and misinformation. They are misleading people to cover up the truth about scaling Bitcoin so they can convince everyone that we need to use their shitty L2's, which they know are inferior to on chain transactions. That's why Ben davenport admits here that if we raise the block size people won't use LN:

https://twitter.com/bendavenport/status/831319684632846336

So it is very clear to see that people have infiltrated Bitcoin and are purposefully preventing scaling to create demand for a product they are trying to sell. They're lying to people, using misinformation and propaganda to cover up the truth about scaling. It is 100% unethical, 100% wrong, completely fucked up in every way and maddening as hell. 


And you're rubbing salt in the wound to make it worse. Have you no heart at all? 


WE are the victim here...and look at you...you are blaming US, for the thing that is being done, TO US. So take a second to stop and realize who is TRULY doing the wrongdoing here. It is not us and we do not deserve these false accusations you are levying against us. 

We are not the ones censoring. We are not the ones doing propaganda and manipulation. We are not banning people with different opinions. All we are doing is spreading the truth, we are victim to what has been done to us. So when you come here and accuse us of doing propaganda, when you come here and say WE bash Core, you are 100% projecting. We are just trying to help dispel misinformation that is being perpetuated and help people understand Bitcoin from a different perspective. 

> Why on earth would you be part of something you so strongly dislike?

Look - I'm really not sure how you think it's fair for big blockers to NOT say something about this. Do you not realize that we had a successful project that was working great for the first 7 years until people came along and tried to change it and now it doesn't work that well? Honestly, can you not see this?

And now they have almost completely destroyed the value proposition...so we forked and made new Bitcoin with the right rules, and we are educating people about what happened. **Literally, what the fuck have we done wrong!?** Are you saying that if YOU had invested into a project and someone came along 7 years later drastically trying to change it with propaganda and manipulation, making it less useful than before, that YOU would not also be upset? 

So I'm not sure what you're getting at here. And honestly I am really mystified by the fact that you are still able to see me and big blockers as the bad guy. You should really take some time to think about who the bad guys are in this equation. I am certain that if you take some time to think about this from an unbiased perspective you will clearly see that we are the victims and not the attackers.

"> /r/bitcoin is the worst

I'm glad we are starting to agree. 

>Be the better man\coin.

Please...explain to me how you think this is NOT what we are already doing. 

What did we do...We left and created our own subreddit. Then, we left and created our own coin, WITH replay protection...Don't you see how proper and unimposing that was? We gave up the brand name, added replay protection etc. So we were as respectful as we could possibly have been...to the guys that are fucking us over. Please, think about this for a second...We did everything right, they STILL attack and bash us and you STILL are here rubbing salt in the wound. It seems there is no way for Big Blockers to win here. I promise you that the more you think about this the more you will see this is so wrong in so many ways. We are 100% the victims here. 

Now all we are doing is helping spread the good word of the original value proposition. Nothing wrong here. Literally...**none of this behavior is unethical in any way.** 

>I dislike the Core hate you spew.

Let's think about how fucked up this is for a minute. 

You are mad at US for hating core. But you aren't mad at core for what they have done to us? What the hell man... CORE is obviously the one doing the wrongdoing with their smearing, manipulation and straight up lies. You think we want that!? No...we hate this... We are simply responding by speaking out against this and educating people on the truth. And you hate US for this!? Goddamn man...that is some seriously twisted shit...

This is what's called ""victim shaming."" Kind of like how an attorney for a rapist in court will attack and shame the victim. So fucked up. 

Obviously the optimal situation for us would be one that we did not have to talk about Core at all. But because of the situation **they** created, we are now the subject of much hatred and ill will (like yours) and not only that, we are left to defend against an INSANE amount of lies told to the public about the technological limitations of scaling in chain. You think we want this?... I would love for Core to stop spreading lies and attacking us because then we could actually move on without having to defend against misinformation and attack. 

So your Ill-will toward us is completely unfounded. I encourage you to spend some time thinking about this issue from a neutral perspective so that you can see how horribly we are being treated and for absolutely no good reason.

It came 13 days ago. It has 1500~ upvotes. There's not enough bots to make that happen artificially.

The second most upvoted post is about how /r/btc and /r/bitcoin view each other. And the most upvoted post of all time is about transaction fees on the Core-chain. It came 4 months ago, so around the time Bitcoin Cash came out.

> I am a part of it.

Then my question is: Why on earth would you be part of something you so strongly dislike? It's going all to hell according to you. Sell now before it's too late. It's a broken chain not aligned with God-Emperor Satoshis view. It's literally unusable due to Core's implementation.

No, it is not easy...don't you see what they have done? They have hijacked all the relevant communication channels and banned us all from talking there. So it's actually pretty fucking hard. 

That and they control a massive troll army dedicated to spreading misinformation and lies. And they spread these lies in places that are censored so we can not even begin to refute it. 

So again, your ill-will toward us is completely unfounded. The way you're talking to me, your victim shaming, your generally negative view of big blockers, it is all completely ridiculous and 100% unfounded. So please stop.

>If you really care so much about something you are not a part of

That's the thing. I am a part of it. I own coins on both forks and have been in Bitcoin since late 2012 when I started mining. Not sure why you are talking to me like this. Core propaganda has been affecting me very strongly in a very negative way, for years now. Am I wrong for reacting? Of course not. 

> Our enemy is not Blockstream. Our enemy is fiat.

Except Blockstream is attempting to take away most of the utility that made Bitcoin great with their unethical roadmap of restricting block size to push people onto L2. So their actions are supportive of the establishment that you understand IS the enemy. (seems like we agree on who the enemy is. Now realize that Blockstream is helping their cause.)

> How should we be reacting?

If you really care so much about something you are not a part of then there should be other causes that are more important. Go to wikileaks for a list of actual terrible things going on in the world you could spread awareness on.

As for what you should be doing about Core? Nothing. Ignore them. Build Bitcoin Cash instead. Talk to the Bitcoin Cash developers - whoever they may be - talk to businesses about why they should accept Bitcoin Cash.

Don't peg me for someone who doesn't see the issues with Blockstream and Core. I am fully aware. But either they will go bankrupt because of their choices, or they must have done something right and live on. To believe bankers won't be involved in crypto currencies at some point is ignorant. Bankers will go where the money is. They will go into Bitcoin Cash when that takes off as well.

I am highly convinced there are more effective and ethical solutions to a better world than the toxic slander propaganda that I see you and others create here in /r/btc.

"What is troubling me is the effort you and your fellowman put into bashing /r/bitcoin and Core is wasted energy that could be spent making /r/btc a vibrant community and Bitcoin Cash a fantastic coin. The toxicity is all basically related to Core-bashing. 

We all know Core sucks so why spend time on them when there is interesting debates to be had about the development of Bitcoin Cash for example? Core is not going to stop development of their coin and if you do not believe in their vision then I expect you to not invest in their coin, right?  It's not like we see the same constant pressure targeted at Litecoin for example.

And if you don't like them, aren't invested in them then why discuss them at all?

"Precisely. ""Especially of a biased or misleading nature.""

That is the exact definition I was going on as well. The reason why I do not believe the big block ""narrative"" fits that description is because there is nothing misleading about anything big blockers say. All we do is explain how Bitcoin is supposed to work, using sources like the white paper as citation. In case you have not noticed, a nasty corporation has come along (late to the game) trying to rewrite history but we are fighting that tooth and nail. So there is nothing dishonest going on, **on our end.**

And sure, Big Blockers make mistakes and there are a lot of trolls on here too, or people that are just straight up wrong. 

If I had to quantify though, I would estimate the amount of misinformation being perpetuated on r/bitcoin is greater than 10x what is perpetuated here. Furthermore I would point out that any misinformation perpetuated here is much more likely to be attributed to honest mistakes, while in r/bitcoin it is likely to be attributed to pure malice and ill intent. 

So, I'm down to debate and share my understanding with people, but when you're debating with me atleast, can you do me the justice of keeping the misleading statements to a minimum? And if one Sub is clearly guilty of something, can you please not project that onto the sub that is mostly innocent? Thanks.

"I haven't been called a troll here before as far as I can remember as I usually don't give baseless accusations. This is not the first time you and me have a discussion, and your name pops up often enough around here. 

The definition usually used about propaganda is ""*information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.*""

I would say it isn't a requirement to be misleading as long as it is biased. Which it is. Everyone who is invested in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash has an economic incentive in this. And to think that there isn't the occasional post here that isn't misleading while pushing a political agenda is absurd. Remember, there is no censorship here, and people have an economic incentive to lie.

I do not disagree that /r/bitcoin is a bad place. But this isn't a choice between a good and a bad sub. It's a choice between a bad and a bad place. I prefer /r/btc, but it's just as toxic as /r/bitcoin. The problem is that /r/bitcoin is much worse at censorship.

"Let me tell you something. If you have ever been called a troll in here, this is why. 

When you say ""toxic slander and propaganda"" you are precisely describing what goes on in r/bitcoin, now remember the reason for the existence of this sub is **because** of this toxic slander and propaganda. We were all getting banned and deleted so we made this sub to talk about Bitcoin and any relevant forks. This sub is our way of having a voice where previously our voices had been deleted.

Very little, if anything at all, that we say on here can be defined as ""propaganda."" If you look up the definition of propaganda you will find it does not match what goes on here. We advertise, yes, we push satoshi's vision, we support the original Bitcoin and the original plan of scaling on chain. But the definition of propaganda requires being ""misleading."" Nothing we say here is misleading. We may have a different opinion than you, but we do not mislead people. 

It is r/bitcoin that misleads people. Telling users they all need to run nodes and that we must hold back scaling for it. Telling users hard forks are dangerous and you can lose all your coins (lie.) Telling people Bitcoin is not supposed to be a currency, only a store of value even though the white paper says ""cash"" in the title. r/bitcoin is the home of toxic smearing and dragons den propaganda that has ran so many of us away from that sub. Anyone can see it. 

So what you are doing is projecting. r/bitcoin is CLEARLY, CLEARLY the toxic propaganda sub, and this one is CLEARLY, CLEARLY NOT. We are here to get away from the behavior you describe. Notice how we tolerate trolling and do not ban trolls? So you are just way out of line with this accusations, nobody is listening to that crap. 

So stop projecting the inadequacies of r/bitcoin onto here. You're not fooling anyone, if anything you are just proving to all of us in the loop here that you are a complete troll.

Honestly, with all of this, how do you expect us to NOT say something about what is going on? Like, really...you think we should just roll over and let them perpetuate misinformation and ruin what could be the greatest invention of our lives? Fuck off. We are going to speak out against this and we 100% SHOULD. You need to take a long look in the mirror and think about who is really doing the wrong-doing here, if you can really think about this from an unbiased perspective you will see we are the victims completely. 

The truth is coming out though. I'm sure you can see it. My advice to you is to get on the right side of history before the tides turn. Stop bashing us for trying to help people see the truth. Stop being upset at us for exposing BScore lies and manipulation. Be upset at the people who are actually doing wrong, which is not us.

You also (conveniently) seem to forget that this came about from the Bitmain ""UAHF"" plan, which includes:

> We will also push for and encourage changes in code, in main block or in extension block, that will make Lightning Network run more safely and reliably than Core’s present version of SegWit does.

> We will encourage and help various multi-layer solutions come into production. 

> At the same time, RootStock, co-founded by the inventor of Lumino, is also trying to implement Lumino on RootStock. Lumino will work perfectly with Lightning Network.

Also, an unrelated quote as people round here hate the ""filthy"" soft fork implementation of SegWit:

> The original Bitcoin NG is a hard fork proposal, but we can soft fork it into the protocol with the extension block framework.

It's all smoke and mirrors.

"Decentralization isn't an all or nothing affair. If it were and you prioritized decentralization above all else, believing that every person on the planet should be running a node, then one factor to consider is using the least amount of bandwidth as possible. This would mean you would restrict blocks to something like 270bytes (0.00027MB) which is one basic transaction and an IP header. This is obviously retarded for anyone that wants to use the network.  


Add in this basic fact: Lightning requires larger blocks to function. It's in the Lightning whitepaper. It requires 133MB blocks for 7 billion people to each open/close **one channel per year**.

The Bitfury paper identified RAM as the biggest bottleneck for onchain scaling, and they figured that a home user node would need around four times as much RAM as the blocksize. They based their estimates of current node capacity from Steam’s user survey. 

However, if you check out [the latest Steam survey results](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=pc) from last month, you can see that over 80% of hypothetical nodes now have at least 8GB of RAM, with a quarter having “12GB or higher”.

"Is the ""atmosphere""(let's just call it air shall we) stuck to the ground? Obviously not because even a 5-year old can move it around easily with his hand. So it's not stuck, so how can it follow the supposed spin of the ball?

It has to be completely stuck because we're supposed to be spinning 460 meters per second right now(at the equator).

So since it's not being held to the ground and it's therefore not ""gravity"" that's holding it down, can you explain to me why a gas would perfectly follow along a ball? Note that it has to be completely perfect as completely calm days on earth is an everyday occurrence.

Can any proof of work (POW) crypto-currency ever achieve the kind of transaction rates required for a mass adoption?  Proponents of proof of stake (POS) claim that POW can never achieve those kind of transaction rates and only POS can do it at a level exceeding what Visa and Mastercard are doing today. For example the EOS (EOS.io) team claims that they will achieve a transaction rate of millions-per-second (on chain).  No one seems to be talking about an increase in transaction rate of more than a few orders of magnitude in a POW system.;1;2;False;revman;dpekdxy;The State of Bitcoin in One Image;https://i.redd.it/swiehnikm4wz.png

"They are not binary things, they are on a sliding scale. Running a full node may be marginally more private than using SPV but it provides little value to the user as the increase in utility is negated by the cost. That is why Satoshi explains here that users running nodes is not the intended configuration for scale:

"There's really no reason to restrict things to consumer hardware. Satoshi always said the network would be major institutions and data centers, so we can go much, much higher than people are comfortable talking about in the fudmosphere created by Core. 

Besides, PoS just boils down to PoW in a different form. Any claims that a system can defy the iron law that ""work (of whatever form) rises to meet available coin subsidy"" are just marketing hype. Any scaling anyone can do securely Bitcoin can do securely. Even in a spinoff id necessary.
