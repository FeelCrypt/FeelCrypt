You don't know what you are talking about. High end cars, exotics, and such can be bought used with low miles and they don't depreciate if you don't put a lot of miles on them. Many go up in value depending on their demand and rarity. I'm not talking about Lexus, I'm talking about Ferrari, Aston Martin, etc. If you have the money for that sort of car you probably have storage too. ;6;1;False;Vibr8gKiwi;dtpo6yv;Lamborghini bitcoin crash troll;https://i.imgur.com/dxMN9SV.jpg

Yes, they are very expensive and you need to know what you are doing.  But as I said, certain high end cars can be investments that appreciate--and that's accurate.  If you have the money it certainly makes more sense to spend $100k to buy a used exotic that has already depreciated and will hold its value over $70k on a new luxury car that will depreciate until it is worthless.  If you know what you're doing you can buy and use cars for no end cost, or even make some $$.;5;0;False;Vibr8gKiwi;dtq8qv6;Lamborghini bitcoin crash troll;https://i.imgur.com/dxMN9SV.jpg

The ""ways to encode data in txs"" that he's referring to, which Ethereum relies on to function, that was taken out of bitcoin, stay with me here, by the Core devs. This was loooong after Satoshi was no longer active.

"> This is a yes/no thing. Either you agree or you disagree. You now both denied that you agree and that you disagree.
> 
> Which is your position?

It's most definitely not a yes/no, black/white situation. Since you ask, I will tell you. I am very much in favour of small low fees, but **not at the cost of diminished security**. In other words, fees to me have lower priority than network security. You may wonder how the two are related, and I'll give you two examples.

One, [here](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) is a paper that discusses Bitcoin in the case of no block reward, which we all know it's coming. It's a techincal paper, but do take the time to read it. In short, Bitcoin is bound to break down completely, unless there's a *healthy backlog of unconfirmed transactions*. The reason is that miners could cheat very easily. Now, you can say ""We'll worry about it when we get there."", but since we know that txs fees will eventually HAVE to make up most/all of the incentive for mining, who's to say WHEN the switch from block reward --> txs fees incentive is to happen? OK, probably not in this very moment, but my gut is telling me it's sooner than many believe, so I say ""Hell, I'm fine if it happens now."".

Two, you may have heard about the ""hash rate death spiral"", which could kill any coin. If a price shock happens, and mining becomes less profitable, miners will switch to other coins. (This is not theoretical, pie in the sky, kind of argument, we are witnessing this currently with BTC and BCH, and it happened in the past with other SHA256 coins. ) In turn, this will make the txs slower and slower, thus favouring other coins and damaging the reputation of a given coin, driving the price down, and only accelerating the demise of a coin. Unless txs fees are high enough, that is. Why? Because as the network gets slower, the fee market will see strong fee bidding, which can SIGNIFICANTLY increase the block reward, and so make mining VERY profitable again. Guess what happens then? Yep, miners come back to the ""dying"" coin, and provide vital support. This may seem like another one of those theoretical/paranoid scenarios, but we've seen this happen with BTC and BCH. 

Don't just dismiss this and tell me I'm a Core/Blockstream shill or something like that. I think I provided very solid evidence on how txs fees are not only useful, but KEY for a healthy and secure network. So this is what I mean network security before fees - High fees become, effectively, network security insurance. In this sense, BCH will need to come up with some clever solution to avoid this problem. If dynamic blocks are ever introduced, increasing the size to accomodate for low fees, a severe price shock will have miners abandon the coin in droves. I don't know if the DAA has any other security flaws, but as of now it seems to be doing a good job at guaranteeing the security. Maybe there are other drawbacks, but I honestly don't know about them... maybe there just aren't, and the DAA solved the second problem in this way. But the first problem remains, and you cannot just wish it away or ignore it. For now, as far as I can see, BTC has a better security model than BCH, and that's basically the main reason I support it.";1;1;False;DesignerAccount;dtqjqgr;As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future;https://i.redd.it/72qgbct2x6e01.jpg

This is a yes/no thing. Either you agree or you disagree. You now both denied that you agree and that you disagree.

Which is your position?

1.Buterins quote is from 2014 I think. Yes ETH has scaling problems, but scalability is their nr.1 priority. The endgoal is transaction and computation at a tiny fraction of a cent. source:  https://tunein.com/radio/Unchained-Big-Ideas-From-The-Worlds-Of-Blockchain-And-Fintech-p887100/?topicId=119409657

2.I do not know why you think I am hostile towards the LN. I am very much hoping that it will succeed. I am hostile towards the decision-making that has lead to the current state of BTC.

3.

>I am simply pointing out a limitation/feature/property of the current design for BTC and BCH

Ok. 

Current design of BCH has always allowed for 1c-5c transactions. If price, amount of transactions or whatever else changes I have faith in the devs to make the necessary changes to restore functioning 1c-5c transactions within a reasonable time.

Current/past design of BTC has previously allowed for 1c-5c transactions. Things changed, stuff happend and here we are now.";3;1;False;random043;dtqbzh7;As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future;https://i.redd.it/72qgbct2x6e01.jpg
"You lack in comprehension and logical deduction capacity.

&nbsp;

>Your assumption that BCH could just 1000x in price and noone would restore the ability to set 1c/ sub-1c fees is utterly ridiculous and not based in reality.

I made no assumption. My exact words:

> I am simply pointing out a limitation/feature/property of the **current** design for BTC and BCH

and I emphasized a key piece of information - CURRENT.

You are saying BCH would get modified. OK, I'll take it at face value. BTC has chosen a different route, LN. Both approaches exist because EVERYONE recognizes the importance of low txs fees, we just disagree on how to achieve that. (No, not getting into discussions on the LN, so don't even start.)

That's also not what I said, nor what is implied by my words.

&nbsp;

>Yeah ""everything else being equal"", sure. It is not though.

Understanding the individual pieces of the puzzle is key to understand the whole picture. If broken software produces ludicrous fees, which is happening for both BTC and BCH, there's room to optimize. But what you cannot say is that *small blocks are causing high fees* anymore than you can say that ""we must increase the number lanes on a highway because drunken drivers cause accidents"". 

With the above, one FUNDAMENTAL reason why BTC fees are ""high"" is because of the very high BTC price.  If 1 BCH = 1BTC = ~$8,500, then the median fee would be ~7x as high as it is now, and that is at a time when blocks are nowhere near full. Go ask ETH what happenend when they started getting congestion on the network, and see how well did that Vitalik's quote age.

">Again, if BCH was $1m, the fees I mentioned above would be standard fare.

No. If BCH would start to appreciate in price there would be changes made so that low fees get maintained.

Your assumption that BCH could just 1000x in price and noone would restore the ability to set 1c/ sub-1c fees is utterly ridiculous and not based in reality.

BCH wants to be a currency. Fees of what is currently valued at under 5c of USD is absolutely crucial for this.

>Are you suggesting that fees in $ are not the most important thing to its usefulness as money?

A: 
>No, that's not what I'm saying

So you agree with me that it is the most most important things (a kill-criteria if above a certain point)? Great.

>And no, fees are not 1:1 correlated with price, it is based on how much other people are willing to pay and software-limitations.

>Yes they are. 100% they are. Everything else being equal, fees increase directly with price, in linear fashion with coefficient 1. At $100 per BTC, a 1sat/b txs is EXACTLY 100x cheaper than a 1sat/b txs at $10,000 per BTC. And, again, this does not depend on the block size!!!

">If this is a serious comment: Median tx fees of 3.7$ would be considered a catastrophe a year ago.

Yes, when BTC was ~10x cheaper than today, the corresponding median txs fee would have been ~$0.37.


It's clear that you don't know what you're talking about when you report the txs fee in $. I'll leave it with you that if BCH was $1m, the **absolute minimum txs fee** would be $2.26. In reality, at current loads and fees, with median txs fee for BCH of ~20b/sat, the fee would be ~$45.

"I can only really speak to myetherwallet (MEW) but I suspect the Electrum (BTC) and Electron Cash wallet (BCH, search this sub) can be used in a similar way. Note that many ""fancy"" wallets (I guess I'm thinking of Exodus here), store your private keys (encrypted) on your Internet machine, so they are a non-starter for absolute security. The important thing is to understand where and how your key is being created, and make sure it is not done on a machine that is ever online. Similarly, when you create a transaction, your private key must be used to sign the transaction while off line, and never be exposed to the Internet. Recently I have used only hardware wallets and MEW (see below).

MEW can be downloaded and run via a web browser, but you need to run it off line. So, download the MEW package to a USD stick and verify its integrity. *Make sure* you navigate to the correct website, there are a lot of fake (phishing) ones around. Once downloaded you can move it to your clean offline computer. You can, in fact, unpack the software straight to the memory stick and run it using a browser from there, this way your keys remain on the stick, rather than the machine (this may or may not be helpful). From here, you can generate the keys (i.e. create a new wallet). The software also allows you to create the transaction offline, once you provide a recipient address. The resulting transaction info can then be copied to an online machine and broadcast to the blockchain (using MEW). This way, your private key never left the clean computer.

My recommendation, long before you want to move any substantial amount of currency, is configure a test wallet (online) and play with the software with a small amount of ETH (or BTC / BCH etc), so you are comfortable with how it works. Maybe create a couple of wallets and send currency between them. Once happy, you can do the same thing with an offline wallet, and again, once happy, you can go to your ""final"" production wallet(s). You'll want to maybe create a separate digital back up on another stick (that never sees the Internet), and also print out the QR code for the private key and store it securely somewhere (again, maybe multiple copies). You might even want to destroy ALL digital information and only rely on paper (but if you do, remember paper can be lost, stolen, burned, damaged etc :). You start to see why hardware wallets are quite attractive because they alleviate a lot of this hassle. (Strictly, they are not a ""one stop"" solution, but you get the idea).

"USB on the go.  it's the ability to plug standard USB devices into your phone by using a dongle. The dongle has a male micro USB on one end (this plugs into the phone) and a female standard USB on the other end.    Not all Android phones support it and iPhone doesn't support it.  

This allows you to plug in various things, like flash card readers, external drives/memory sticks, and, for me, a hardware crypto wallet.   this is key when you are traveling with an iPhone (which doesn't allow USB on the go--surprise surprise) because you don't need to rely on a foreign computer but can use the android for this purpose. 

The samsung galaxy s6 provides enough power thru this method so that the Trezor wallet can power up and function.

and in order to power up the hardware wallet and use it you need a computer (Or phone like in my setup above) plus a  browser and internet access.

"I've read the fine print. That's why I use it. Connections are via HTTPS. If there's a security breach on the network itself (more likely), they do cover that. It's in the fine print.

Further, just because you prefer to support crypto one way (via a personal wallet) which works for you doesn't mean it's the definitive and only way to do things. This is a kind of close minded mentality on this sub which comes up often. People should just be at least somewhat aware that the exchanges are pushing up a demand and thus the price and value by making things more accessible to more consumers (whether that is sometimes bad or not).

You only need this once in a while. Your third layer is a paper wallet, like having valuables in a safe. You hardly ever use this. 

Now you could say that this goes beyond people's skillset. But this can be taught.  Being your own bank is quite the responsibility. The problem with the coinbase bank is that crypto can not be reversed. Unlike a fiat bank when if funds from the bank get stolen, you will get your money back.

That is why people here are getting excited again. Do you know how many local communities are started based around Bitcoin Cash? Worldwide there are enormous amounts of local sharing communities that don't use fiat but use IOU's for exchanging services with other services.  It's not to much about money or getting rich but about communities. Well all of these have their own system. Most use computers and the internet. In greece they have become very popular when the 2008 crisis hit the country. Well all of these now have some new technology to work with to make their lives a little easier. 

Anyway, right now it already has a lot of benefits to offer over any other financial system on the internet. Just ask the people here that are using it as a payment system/currency.

Look at yours.org, it's the currency of yours.org. 

For me as an artist, now I finally have some steady income from my music in the winter. Why would I miss out on this? It's not possible for me to have this any other way. How you one user that listend to my music on soundcloud press a button and I receive something of value that I exchange and then buy a pizza with? Youtube? Not possible.  So for content creators this can be life changing. Instead of only the big youtube channels making some money now even smaller content creators can start making a little bit of money. 

If you don't see the benefits of that, then what could you possibly see as a benefit. Why are you even on this sub? 

It does not suck for me or the more technological advanced user ... it does kind of suck for the computer illiterate person. But with technology this has always been that way. The first internet businesses made a lot of money because they where the first intternet businesses just as right now on yours.org I make some good money on my music because there are not to many musicians active on the platform.

"Those are not as much fun :-) 

No but seriously, I recently send 140 EUR from my Canadian bank to a friend in Belgium. The total in CAD was 263 CAD. With the current exchange rate this would have been 216.72 CAD. The rest was for my Canadian bank, spread + fee. And it took 4 days. 

I would very much like there to be a worldwide accepted system to transfer money without having to wait 3 days or pay a 30 CAD fee. (yes paypal is a bit better but still does not solve the problem) 

I mean in the 1980's you could have told everybody that was excited about email but it was kind of complex to just ... send a letter? 

Also the bank can decide to freeze your account. If you use crypto the right way nobody can do this to you.  Using crypto has benefits and detriments and it's very young technology. Give it another 10 or 20 years and then we will talk. It will eventually be accepted by everybody just like mobile phones and email.

"If you are day trading crypto, you need to keep some crypto on exchanges. And it doesn't make sense to withdraw a small amount of crypto what with the hefty withdrawal fees that exchanges charge, often times several times more than the actual mining fees. Even Poloniex charges a 0.0001BCH withdrawal fee for BCH, which is outrageous. 

Some exchanges charge 0.0005-0.001BCH for withdrawal. Highway robbery because you know damn well that 1 sat/byte is enough to get into the next block for BCH. And there are times where 2 sat/byte is all you need for BTC even if you are lucky. In my country, BTC withdrawal fees at exchanges range from 0.0015-0.0025BTC.  Which is ludicrous. And if you live here, you have no other choice if you want to convert your fiat to BTC. I buy a lot of my BTC on the OTC market to avoid that nonsense and because I have good rep, I get a good deal on my coins. On alt trading sites, BTC withdrawal fees are typically 0.0005BTC-0.001BTC and even that is expensive. 

Exchanges are gouging customers on withdrawals because they don't want you to withdraw and take ownership of your coins. They want you to keep all of your crypto with them, as if they were a bank.

Thank you for your post. I have been wondering about this issue since I got back into crypto a month ago. Besides investing for monetary purposes, I invest because of the philosophy behind crypto. I got into this years ago when BTC was worht $100. Unfortunately I bought them through MtGox and WeExchange and ended up with nothing when they came crashing down. At that time I had no idea about security issues and I only invested $2000 so I sucked it up and tried to move on. I did accept my losses and took it as a learning experience but I’ve always wanted to get back into investing in crypto and I finally decided to do it. But I am so a bit paranoid about losing my assets again...I did some research on wallets but I find so much contradictory information that I don’t know what I can’t trust. Is my best bet a paper wallet? I currently hold BTC, ETH, LTC in coinbase and XRP in a toast wallet. What do you guys recommend I do? Are there any cons to keeping them in a paper wallet besides the obvious of losing the actual paper? I’m in it for the long run so I don’t need my coins somewhere I can liquidate them quickly. My main concern is security.

To be absolutely sure, you want to make a ""paper"" wallet on an offline machine that has never been connected to the Internet (or possibly compromised in any other way). Although a hassle, it is certainly possible. But also bear in mind that a hardware wallet is essentially a paper wallet protected from the Internet. Most people write down their seed phrase on a piece of paper - so in effect, the hardware wallet is only as safe as that piece of paper (but it can go online without risk). The level of paranoia you want, is going to be proportional to the amount of value tied up in your cryptocurrency. Tbh hardware wallets are very convenient if a little over priced IMO (I own a couple).

Also, any wallet you chose, make sure you test it (securely) with a small transfer (in and out) first. And remember online security is not your only concern. Loss of your ""paper"" keys (take a photo and store on memory sticks?) or your seed phrase can occur for a variety of shitty reasons, like common theft, accident loss, fire, etc. Keep secure backups in separate places.";2;1;False;timmerwb;dtpe1s3;[PSA] If your Bitcoin are not ready-to-transact in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control, then you don't control your Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uzz9t/psa_if_your_bitcoin_are_not_readytotransact_in_a/

Amazon should be okay if you buy from Amazon itself (I wouldn't recommend a third-party Amazon seller), but the best is to buy direct.

And make sure you set up a new recovery phrase when you get it. If a printed phrase comes with it or a person ever tells you which phrase to use it's a scam. Write your phrase down, test that the restore works before putting your coins in it, and keep it safer than the device itself.

"Concerted media slandering is what Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders went through. What Trump went through was an intentional Streisand effect.

I'll keep my mind open and base some searches off your comment. But what I've seen so far has all played into the hands of big corp. And nothing spectacular in his speeches.

As for the tax cuts, that just didn't hurt much enough for Wall Street, they decided to use that as an excuse to look hurt and make Trump seem like he was doing 'progress'. That's what I meant by smoke and mirrors. Just like the good things Obama did which were just intentionally enough and not more.

I was also into Ron Paul btw, but I wasn't particularly deep into anything political back then. But any candidate that speaks out against the banks with effort has my interest. Outside of that, not so much.";1;0;False;PsyRev_;dtp9vwg;MAKE BITCOIN CASH AGAIN;https://i.redd.it/judgsqo46rd01.jpg

".... what? Dude the entire status quo is uniformly aligned against him. The tax cuts are terrible for the globalists and Wall St because they outsource all their shit to other countries , and with America being 12% cheaper rate now that is all at an end. 

I don't have time to google videos for you dude, but I absolutey promise you if you listen to a full speech of his there is plenty about tearing down the crooks on wall st etc. 

His early campaign speeches about NATO, TPP, China, IMF, all of it is squarely and purely anti establishment 

He has faced the most concerted media slandering in history precisely because he is tearing down the status quo.

Disclaimer:  I'm an old school (2008) Ron Paul audit the fed kinda guy, I have no incentive to defend trump, just telling you the truth: he is 100% against the establishment. Is he full on end the fed? No. But he sure as hell ain't gonna print 3 trillion a year like Obama did.";1;1;False;5400123;dtp76h5;MAKE BITCOIN CASH AGAIN;https://i.redd.it/judgsqo46rd01.jpg

"> he literally turned establishment finance into his enemy with his speeches and rhetoric.

LOL

> Remember the Wall St people crying about the tax cuts saying how bad they would be??

Yeah they would cry so much about tax cuts wouldn't they, lmao. It doesn't matter shit to them compared to staying in comfortably in their seats. It's smoke and mirrors.

> You've already made the choice to believe otherwise though, so I doubt you will change your mind. 

You'll change my mind if you show me anything Trump has said that would piss the establishment off. There is none though (not gonna lie though, you will change my mind if you reveal some hidden truth on this to me), because he never pissed the establishment off, he and the establishment are jerking each other off right now as we speak.
