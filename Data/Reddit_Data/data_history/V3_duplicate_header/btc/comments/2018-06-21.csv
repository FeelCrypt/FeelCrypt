I found a really good ICO - Paytomat. It is a decentralized system of cryptocurrency payment. Imagine world where you can pay for your everyday stuff via crypto. Itâ€™s a future! In case this project will succeed - it is quite close future :) The ecosystem of the project is unique indeed! However, do not take everything for granted - you always should check everything by yourself :) #PAYTOMAT;1;0;False;wowaw7867;e12gghb;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.

">Your assuming my point was relating to censorship. My point was relating to the way we handle things, you call it censorship because it's not what you are use to. The reason why you're seeing this as censorship is because you're views are aligned with r/btc and expect better treatment.

No, I call it censorship because I know what censorship is. My views align with r/btc because they *also* know what censorship is.

>It is the same thing, it's the same argument and we can't verify those claims. We don't mind getting those posts sometimes if it's legitimate and it adds something new to the discussion, otherwise they can go to r/btc or another sub.

It is NOT the same thing. If you get one person screaming 'FIRE!' in a crowded theater and there is none, that is spam. If you see 30 people screaming fire as they run out of the theater, you need to turn your @ss around and run. **MISTAKING THAT FOR SPAM WILL COST YOU YOUR LIFE**, so its best you not mislead people by causing them to misidentify the 'spam' in their lives.

>I also have no idea what r/Monero and r/Litecoin have to do with this, because I've barely ever visited the Litecoin sub and the Monero sub seems fine to me.

The claim has nothing to do with your personal viewership or subscription to either sub. The claim charges a systemic bias towards members of these communities by allowing them to flout rules on vote brigading, posting FUD and spam, etc. Anyone who's read r/cc for the last year and a half at least, or just search 'monero', will see the copious amounts of spammy monero posts. There were even threads a year ago that called out how many monero posts were on the front page.

That has **nothing** to do with whether or not you 'visit r/ltc'. You know this, the fact that you seek to hide it means you have a nefarious agenda in your replies. You are subtly responding to strawmen in order to mislead.

>How had Dash been censored? We have posts literally multiple times a day on Dash. I have nothing against Dash and use to hold a large amount, my brother is invested in it too.

Again, Search for 'Dash' in r/cc. Every Dash post that is postive, good news gets nearly 0 views, almost always 0 comments, and almost always 0 upvotes. Now things seem to be changing a bit, but anyone who has visited the sub over at least the last year and a half will agree that Dash FUD was allowed and actively encouraged. 

And the fact that you have as a moderator one of the more prominent members of the xmr community, to whom one of your mods referred as a 'xmr fanboi', is massive red flag and shows strong conflict of interest. Normally, it would be rather strange, but not necessarily untoward for a prominent member of a community to become a moderator of a GENERAL body of such communities. For example, it would be weird for the King of England to be also the King of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands at the same time (real life historical examples notwithstanding; those of which, anyway, stand out because of their strangeness).

However, the xmr community is widely known to be very 'aggressive' with their bias, with their 'marketing' ('SHUM teehee', 'fluffy says, 'don't buy monero'', 'Monero is the only truly private coin', 'monero is the only truly fungible coin', etc.), it is a massive conflict of interest for one of the more prominent members of the xmr community to be a mod there, and to have been there for so long. This is a **MASSIVE** red flag that indicates that **the same force that was able to buy up r/bitcoin, censor it and take it over** is the same force that bought of r/cryptocurrency, and the xmr community is aligned with that force by the employment of a prominent member of their community in a position of power where they can influence competing communities through censorship.
That's why he felt comfortable threatening to BAN ME for posting the wired [article](https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/) about monero's privacy being broken. 

>I also update AutoMod a lot and have never seen a ""shadowban"" section, so either that was a long long time ago or you're wrong. Nor do I know what posts you're referring to.

I posted a thread here about it.

>Again, how are we biased of those coins? Other coins get more time on the front page than those two and even if they did get a lot more publicity, that doesn't mean we're biased or censor other posts as you're just complaining about upvotes and I don't see any references to post to suggest what you're claiming. You might as well complain about other subs that don't agree with you.

You're trying to handwave this away. I'm not stupid. **We're not stupid!** We have noticed the censorship and will be calling it out from now on. You can't whitewash this!";1;1;False;thethrowaccount21;e11la9g;"Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: ""I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out.

">Irrelevant as the claim is that this is how censorship gets started regardless of 'who you are'. Thus you could be r/popecoin for all I care, the same tactics would be employed and would work if not warned against.

Your assuming my point was relating to censorship. My point was relating to the way we handle things, you call it censorship because it's not what you are use to. The reason why you're seeing this as censorship is because you're views are aligned with r/btc and expect better treatment.

>Its NOT the same thing. If I get banned from there and post ""I got banned"", and then posted it again, and again, that would be posting the same thing. But if every user who did it posted that, it would NOT be the same thing, and hiding this would be censorship as you're deliberately trying to hide popular activity/sentiment while claiming to 'follow the rules'.

It is the same thing, it's the same argument and we can't verify those claims. We don't mind getting those posts sometimes if it's legitimate and it adds something new to the discussion, otherwise they can go to r/btc or another sub.

>The same rules you allowed certain communities like monero and ltc and probably others to flout.

I also have no idea what r/Monero and r/Litecoin have to do with this, because I've barely ever visited the Litecoin sub and the Monero sub seems fine to me.

>You may not realize it, but people have been watching that sub for a long time. The pattern is distinct and unmistakable. For whatever reason, through whatever policy, Dash specifically has been censored, censured and downplayed by official action/inaction on your part. Threads that are clearly FUD are still up if you search for 'Dash'. Either you guys clean up your act or it will become obvious that you are financed and supported by the same people that destroyed r/bitcoin.

How had Dash been censored? We have posts literally multiple times a day on Dash. I have nothing against Dash and use to hold a large amount, my brother is invested in it too. 

We try to clear up all FUD, however if it's still there it's perhaps not FUD, but legitimate concerns, **or** we didn't see it/wasn't reported.

>NO ITS NOT. If 50 people post about r/bitcoin mods, AND 50 PEOPLE WERE UNFAIRLY BANNED BY THEM, that's called NEWS not spam! In that instance you then are aiding the censors and infiltrators. Beware.

Again, they're welcome to post that on another sub like r/btc. We can't verify every claim that is made and we don't want threads that adds no value.

>No evidence? How about the favoritism you play towards certain coins? The leeway you give the monero community specifically could only come about through nepotism. I see that one of your mods is an ACTIVE contributor to the xmr project, and even one of your own mods called him a 'xmr fanboy'. If you don't think that's evidence for the possibility of corruption, well, you're kinda proving my point.

We don't ""play favouritsm"" to any projects and remove mods that do. How do we give the Monero community any more leeway than others? It's almost impossible to have mods that don't have any favourable views to a project and our mod team is quite diverse regarding the communities they come from and are always monitored for bias. And you might as well complain about r/btc because they're biased to BCH and every other sub.

>Right, because its not like this whole post was started by a former mod who claims you kicked him out. Like I haven't personally seen and felt your censorship. You guys shadow-banned me in the winter and I had to post a thread exposing Monero here in r/btc just to get any views. So you can stop lying to me directly now, as you obviously don't know who you're talking to. I've already DOCUMENTED the corruption of your subreddit, sir, please sit down somewhere.

I had never heard of that mod before and he was kicked out because he was inactive for months. The other mods even PM'ed him to be more active otherwise he would be kicked out and he never did become active after that. We usually have a thread every few months that shows inactive mods, we give them a chance or two to become active again and we tell them in advance. 

I also update AutoMod a lot and have never seen a ""shadowban"" section, so either that was a long long time ago or you're wrong. Nor do I know what posts you're referring to.


>And yet you subtly allow one coin (like XMR, or LTC) to receive favorable treatment, i.e. allowing them to FUD, shitpost, not censoring positive posts about them, not hiding negative posts etc. So I don't think you can objectively say that. Your sub clearly has been playing favorites for a long time now.

Again, how are we biased of those coins? Other coins get more time on the front page than those two and even if they did get a lot more publicity, that doesn't mean we're biased or censor other posts as you're just complaining about upvotes and I don't see any references to post to suggest what you're claiming.
