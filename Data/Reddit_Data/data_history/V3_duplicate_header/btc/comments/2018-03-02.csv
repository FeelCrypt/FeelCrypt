I know I'm nobody and have absolutely no say in what Bitpay's priorities should be, but if I may make a suggestion, getting the payment processor to fully accept BCH for merchants, converting it to fiat on the fly and all, is higher priority than worldwide debit card, IMHO.

It certainly is in most points. But the US has to pay taxes **everytime** they sell Bitcoin for fiat. In Germany if you held at least one year (your first purchase counts - first in first out) then you do not pay any taxes. If you sell in less then a year then you pay taxes only if you had profits higher then 600€. So loading the Bitpay Card in Germany and spending fiat would be much easier than in the US.";6;2;False;themadscientistt;dv25vmk;You Can Now Turn Bitcoin Cash Into Dollars With the BitPay Card;https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-card-bitcoin-cash/

That is true. But when it comes to selling crypto for fiat at least Germany is pretty clear and not terrible at all. Holding for 1 year qualifies you to sell as much as you want for ZERO taxes. In that year you can buy as much as you want. Your first buy and your first sell count (hence: First in first out) That seems ok. Maybe not awesome - as BCH should be handled as a real currency - but ok.

"Tracking basis is the hard part, which Shift has no idea of (they don't know where your coins came from, let alone how or when you got them and for how much money to establish basis value). Knowing the sale price is the easy part. But Shift doesn't even offer a utility to export transactions. I had to export from the linked Coinbase account (which only gives a timestamp, a BTC amount, and if I'm lucky the name of the vendor) and match the transaction dollar amount from the mobile app for every single transaction line-by-line.

Trust me, no part of it is easy in the current state of affairs, and certainly no part of it is automatic. You might be able to use some spreadsheet/csv wizardry coupled with a paid service like Bitcoin.Tax or CoinTracking.info to help out with keeping track of basis throughout the year, but even that can be non-trivial and work intensive to do correctly.

To complicate matters further, when the Shift card randomly declines or you use it somewhere that places a ""hold"", you get that as a refund back in the current BTC exchange rate (not the rate which you originally paid), so that itself must be treated as some form of income/gain/loss and has it's own basis established that now must be tracked.

>Ok wtf is ""monetary policy""? 

It's one of the government's roles in our society: to manage the balance between unemployment, inflation, and economic growth.

Inflation is a tool to encourage economic development because as the price of goods goes up, the buying power of a dollar goes down. Therefore you a) buy goods sooner rather than later, which moves money around faster and b) invest money in capital goods that produce economic output which you then sell for more money.

Ignoring the role of monetary policy is ignorant when discussing a technology dealing with money.

">Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff also supports eliminating cash, not just to thwart underground economies, but also to help improve economic policy. Central banks typically fight recessions by lowering interest rates, which stimulates the economy by making saving less lucrative and encouraging consumers and businesses to spend. However, if interest rates dip below zero, meaning banks effectively charge savers, customers can simply withdraw their cash and sidestep the policy entirely. This effect is known as the “zero lower bound,” and is considered a serious limit to the effectiveness of monetary policy. “There are certainly many ways to skirt the zero lower bound, but the most elegant would be getting rid of most cash,” Rogoff says.

"It's no surprise to me. That's what banks have been aiming toward all these years: a cashless society where everyone's money can be tracked and controlled by a central authority.  Remember: if you control money, you control people's lives as well. Don't like what someone says or does? Cut off their access to money and let them starve to death. Force them to get the infamous mark on their right hand or forehead if they want to buy or sell.

&nbsp;

My point is, the dangers of a cashless society were envisioned by our ancestors, even though they had no knowledge of barcodes, RFID technology, electronic cash, and whatnot. If physical cash is eliminated, then a digital equivalent will be necessary, one which won't place us in the hands of evil (e.g. central banks, oppressive governments). That's where cryptocurrencies come into play. Their decentralized nature is what these forces of evil fear, for they can't control them. Why do you think attempts at cryptocurrency regulation have failed? Because regulation assumes you have only a single or couple of points of failure which you can successfully exploit to take down entire networks. That's obviously not the case. Sure, you can attempt to control fiat-crypto gateways, but people will then go underground to evade detection.
