"> Convoluted? I buy a gift card with Bitcoins and then i buy things on Amazon with said gift card. Seems pretty easy to me.

I buy a gift card, then I show the seller of the gift card what I want from Amazon. Then the seller buys the product with the gift card and sends me the goods (or not if I'm unlucky).

Then I can say ""Look, I bought on Amazon with btcs!""

The payment system for Overstock only works when the merchant accepts the Bitcoin (not BCH) at the end of the transaction.  Propaganda, or in this case, a direct false statement, is when OP stated that Overstock accepts BCH.  It doesn’t.
