In the beginning, v early, it was pretty centralised, Satoshi was over 50% hashrate for a long time... but bitcoin wasn't really worth anything then, and someone had to bootstrap the network.

We're far more centralised than we were in Jan 2013 when I got involved.

"I guess your last point is where we differ then. I'm not that bothered about getting rid of banks. It's not only unlikely... It would also be detrimental to me financially.
I see Bitcoin more as a commodity... Like digital gold.
I know what the white paper says, but things sometimes turn out different to how they were initially envisaged.

I'd be more positive towards x2 if we had fully explored how far segwit can take us (being 100 percent adoption). X2 seems rushed and doesn't appear to have the quality of devs that bitcoin has.

Sure, Bitcoins price could have been even higher if fees were lower... But it's doing alright. I'd argue, all these forks damage it more.

Primarily, off chain scaling makes more sense to me. If it doesn't work, core could always try block size increases then.

Block size is being intentionally restricted. The way this project is supposed to be, miners produce blocks as big as they need to meet market demand for on chain transactions. If there is any limit at all, it is a restricted block size.

"I don't disagree with any of the facts you presented in the article, but I do disagree with some of the conclusions you reached. Mainly I disagree that we're faced with the option of scaling on-chain versus being pushed to L2. I think an ideal system will ultimately involve and expand both.

I don't need my coffee purchase on-chain. I don't need every purchase from Ebay to have an individual on-chain transaction for every purchase I make with every vendor. I believe developing a complementary off-chain settlement system to reduce on-chain transactions for those who wish to use it is an important part of Bitcoin's future, but I don't think anyone should be forced to use it. At the same time, I do think we'll likely need block size increases eventually, and ultimately a reasonable fee system for on-chain transactions is important to compensate miners going forward. This isn't an all or nothing proposition, and some of these technologies still need to be developed before we'll know what the final and hopefully optimal combination will be.

I personally think a 2MB block size right now is largely inconsequential, and really not worth all the fuss everyone is making. I think we'll see a block size increase eventually, and it will probably be larger than 2MB. My support for the developers comes down to the fact that they still offer the best path forward. Who is even developing BTC1 now that Bloq is launching their own coin? 2X supporters expect the community at large to abandon the development team that has been working on Bitcoin for years in exchange for no clear development future and a minor capacity upgrade? That just doesn't make sense.

So I guess I just see a different future for Bitcoin than you do. I see an on-chain system with a sustainable fee structure, complemented by a off-chain system for trivial or reoccurring transactions users voluntarily use with a vastly reduced fee structure. The fuss over 2X is a bit unreasonable considering what it is, but that is the response anyone is going to get from the type of people who are passionate about Bitcoin when a group of businesses try to decide the future of Bitcoin behind closed doors.";2;1;False;efadd;dozollo;"Jihan Wu: ""Blockstream has executed the order from big banks very well to restrict block size and cripple Bitcoin.""";https://twitter.com/jihanwu/status/923853293440311296

"If you look at the specific examples I grabbed and edited in after posting, you'll see the condescension I'm talking about. Asking me to clarify my position is fine, implying the only possible reason I've reached the conclusions I have is because of naivety or susceptibility to propaganda does not convey mutual respect.

As far as holding back scaling, I would argue the trade off is currently acceptable. I personally don't see the current fees as a large hindrance given the state of Bitcoin. I've never paid more than $2 to move funds, which is admittedly unreasonable for a mature, global, mass adopted system for transactions, but I don't think Bitcoin or societies around the world are ready for that yet anyway. Even with the amazing year we've had in terms of public interest, adoption, and value increase, Bitcoin is still a niche technology used primarily by individuals who don't *really* need it. 

We like to talk about Venezuelans using it to protect themselves from a corrupt government, but place like that where Bitcoin is really needed are still in the vast minority. The people being hurt by the delayed scaling resolution aren't poor Africans being held back by their inability to access financial services, or the downtrodden masses living under oppressive regimes; its a bunch of relatively well off individuals from developed nations and businesses who are seeking to increase their annual profits. We're the fortunate early, early adopters who are complaining that developers won't make compromises in their immature technology, and that they won't sacrifice their goals for the future for our immediate benefit in the present. We're alpha testers complaining that the developers are wasting their time optimizing the content we've already played for mass release, instead of starting work on the next expansion for us.

This is already way too long, but basically I'm temporarily okay with a less than ideal system inconveniencing us fortunate few, if the long term payout is an overall better system. Right now I don't have any reason to doubt the direction Core is going. If this sub is right and it does end up being some Blockstream abomination, there is nothing stopping me from cashing out and supporting another crypto, and that should be the incentive every business and developer considers in these situations.

"I see you are very familiar with the small block narrative.

Miners are prepared to deal with the increasing cost of running a node and are economically incentivized to scale up their hardware to keep up. So not an issue for them, whatsoever. The cost of running the node is on average less than 1% of the cost of their mining equipment, which the node dishes work out to. So something that is less than 1% of their cost to begin with marginally increasing in cost is not a problem, as a matter of fact it is completely countered by the increasing value of their holdings. Remember, increasing cost to run a node = more transactions being done in the Bitcoin network = increasing value of Bitcoin, and miners hold Bitcoins, so this is what they want.  

Same story with merchants who are economically incentivized to run a non-mining full node to check the validity of incoming payments. 

So the only people that are **really** affected by this are users running full validating nodes with no economic incentive to do so.

Everything you said is true, the only issue is that you completely ignore who is restricting the block size.  An empty block is not a big deal unless you have 70k transactions in the mempool and increasing transaction fees.  Antpool can do as they wish if it is in their best interest to turn down the transaction fees they could be collecting.

Yeah. I don't personally like how EDA operates now. Hopefully we can come up with something better or default to the normal difficulty adjustment altogether if/when things have calmed down.

I also agree that SegWit and Schnorr are worth exploring and that's why I support SegWit2x. My stance on this is simply that the current congestion and high fees are detrimental to Bitcoin, which should be first and foremost a p2p cash which would get rid of banking when it comes to financial transactions between people.

No, what bitcoin does is not consensus. There is never a point of finality, where a decision is made and cannot, at least theoretically, be undone.

I have been using Bitcoin and owning Bitcoins since long before you ever heard of it. I'm quite happy with how it works and I'm proud to not be one of the slimebags around here that lie about it working in order to pump competing alternatives.

"The doesn't make sense. Jihan was one of the strongest complainers about the block size. You said ""you need to give them incentive to include TXs"" ...but even though the TX fees were at record levels, antpool still mined empty blocks fairly regularly. You're right, if he'd always mined full blocks, there would still have been backlog. That isn't the point though, he was willfully exacerbating a problem he was complaining about most loudly.

Tell me what about that makes sense? He was willingly leaving money on the table (those transaction fees). It makes sense when you realise the reason it was worth doing: the advantage of ASICBOOST.

">who are either dumb, or infiltrated by government

Why do you think so?

I can see their logic easily. 

Jihan wants Bitcoin to grow on-chain so that mining remains profitable in the long run and Bitcoin remains secure. For this Bitcoin needs more on-chain usage. If you  fit 200.000 tx into a block each paying 10 cent fee you get $20 000 fees collected per block. With 2000 tx/block you'd have to collect $10 in fees for every transaction, which severely limits growth, use cases and thus price appreciation. In the future the block reward will be gone and Bitcoin needs to attract as much usage as possible during this bootstrapping phase.

Roger probably sees the same from the market perspective and thus support similar solutions.

They can't force anything. It remains up to all of the ecosystem to decide the way Bitcoin goes towards the future. Blockstream/Core supporters, Bitcoin Cash supporters and SegWit2x supporters just have a different vision about what it's going to be. I know it's easy to call people you disagree with dumb or malicious, but that's rarely the case.

I support scaling Bitcoin on-chain and I can assure you that I only wish best for Bitcoin. Nevertheless, Bitcoin should work without that, by self interest of all participants.

I don't disagree that the idea of everything being on-chain is good in theory, I just don't see how that is accomplished without risking centralization. Doing so reduces the ability of individual users to confirm the validity of transactions. That might seem like an unreasonable concern, but in a world where something as outlandish as multiple international banks colluding to rig the LIBOR rate affecting interest rates world wide actually happened, it seems much more reasonable for users to demand a method of independent validation. It also makes the network more susceptible to attack from world governments. Again, this may seem like an unreasonable concern until you consider the ridiculous times we live in.
