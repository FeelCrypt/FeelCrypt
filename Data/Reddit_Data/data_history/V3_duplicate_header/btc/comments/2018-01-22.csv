"tl;dr It definitely has a huge plus when the mining hardware is only useful for one task because it incentivizes the miners to be more fully committed to the coin because their hardware can't be resold for other purposes.";4;2;False;unitedstatian;dt2lf1h;Five stages of Cobra-Bitcoin's grief over decentralized money (or Bitcoin Cash as we know it);https://i.redd.it/98f6i54zqlb01.png
"Ok..

In my opinion ASIC mining is not a bad thing at all but a good thing. I remember the beginnings of the block size debate several years ago. I was pretty frustrated by the miners because they seemed so undecided and did not manage to increase the blocksize. Back then I thought that the protocol is flawed because miners do not really need to keep their bitcoins, they can just immediately sell them. Because of this I felt bitcoin miners had not enough incentives to care about the long term success of bitcoin and would just be happy about the increased fees caused by a restricted block size. 

I was wrong. Some post of vitalik actually hinted me to the fact that miners actually have some (bitcoin's success dependent) capital locked away (like in PoS) without being able to liquidate it easily. This capital is their ASIC hardware. Miners who possess ASICs have a commitment to all the coins they can mine with these ASICs. If bitcoin would fail then ASICs would turn into worthless pieces of metal as you can only mine SHA-256 cryptos with them. The vast majority of all mining rewards for SHA-256 is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. So a majority of SHA-256 ASIC miners wouldn't survive the fall of Bitcoin (Cash). That's also why right now they still need Legacy Bitcoin.

Now let's in contrast take a look at GPU mining. There are hundreds/thousands of cryptos you can mine with a GPU. Miners just switch to whatever GPU currency pays the biggest block reward which is subject to change. So that means they are not that dependent on a certain currencies success. This means GPU coins cannot profit from (development) funding from miners that well. They're dependent on some kind of donation.

Another thing is that I see mining as a wonderful mechanism to bootstrap economies that have this currency as primary income stream. Think of all the villages in china with hydro plants. With a currency that's cheap to use they have an incentive (especially when going underground) to actually use that currency as a payment among each other. IMO this will form a strong backbone in the future for Bitcoin Cash. 

Having communities (miners) all over the world that are committed to a currency (unlike gpu miners) will form a strong backbone and make that currency especially attractive for investors who seek something they can store their money in long term. It will make sense to chose a currency with thousands of little economies behind it making it more stable and less volatile, less prone to price swings caused by day traders and speculation (more coins are in the hands of people who actually use it as a real currency).

All because miners are **committed**. It's what separates Bitcoin (Cash) from all the other thousands of coins.";13;3;False;saddit42;dt2h7up;Five stages of Cobra-Bitcoin's grief over decentralized money (or Bitcoin Cash as we know it);https://i.redd.it/98f6i54zqlb01.png

"[Github Pull Request](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/2010)

From Cobra Bitcoin 
>From the moment the user visits the site, and even in the video, the entire site has always emphasised low fees. Obviously we don't expect some insanely low fee, but the current fees make it impossible for reasonable people to transact with each other. I don't know what's gone wrong, but I don't think the correct solution is to change the site to focus on the ""uncensorable"" aspect. We'd have to go deep into lots of pages where low fees and ""fast"" transactions are mentioned and do translations for everything. Fees were supposed to come down with Segwit anyway.

>What even is an uncensorable transaction? Cash is uncensorable, but with cash, there are no fees. So someone reading that would still assume that fees are low or nonexistent. The only way to present the current and possible future state of the network (if nothing is done) accurately would be to somehow sell these fees as a ""cost"" for the uncensorable transactions. So we'd have to market high fees as a feature. This is a huge change to how Bitcoin has been marketed for much of its history, and it implies that we've misled millions of people about what Bitcoin actually is. In fact, it'll actively turn people off and they'll use something else. Heck, even the criminals and darknet market people, the ones that need the ""uncensorable"" aspect the most, would be turned off by that, they all use Monero anyway for anonymity and lower fees.

>I think we just have to leave this for the network to resolve.

In 2016-2017, while trying to fork to a larger block size, we got so stuck in this ""ask for permission"" and ""wait for consensus"" method that was the ""BIPs"" process that Bitcoin Core themselves implemented that it became a permission-required system instead of a permission-less system.

"> I will repeat what I told you then. The three of you sat around apparently waiting for some permission to act, instead of implementing the DAA that you preferred. That was your (and others) mistake.

First to reiterate, this isn't about me or my ideas.

You seem to mix up here is the difference between one algorithm and the complete mining-node software.

In actual fact there were complete and tested and peer-reviewed several algorithms. Nobody disputed that.

> it was time to make a change, and nobody else had stepped up and implemented a new DAA, so he did it

This shows you have been lied to. There were at that time that Amaury started writing the DAA that got merged already 2 or 3 completely written and tested algorithms ready to merge. He just had personal problems with them and thought he could do better. That is his right, but then he should say so. Not some sham about his boss and business partner being independent and picking his proposal over the others.

And here is why it bothered me at the time; in an extremely similar case someone else (bitpay) actually shipped a solution that the market needed (new address format) and Amaury did a complete 180 compared to this specific item. He no longer said it was about the first to act or the one to ""just do it"". Suddenly he stated that we needed something different, something that he happened to have been working on for a month at that time. And he actually asked people to please wait for some months instead...

When people reason two completely different ways in similar situations, you have to question if they are being biased.

----
> The three of you sat around apparently waiting for some permission to act, instead of implementing the DAA that you preferred. That was your (and others) mistake.

Again, this isn't about me. I didn't have any algo written.

What you are suggestion is that those DAA authors should ""implement"" so miners can select it. And here is the problem with that idea;  we are talking about 50 lines of code. 50 lines out of a total of 113KLOC for a full node. Do you expect people to start a new client? Do the whole packaging, marketing etc etc, just to push out their ideal solution for the DAA?

Anyone suggesting that people should have done the work is missing that huge part of the puzzle.  You can't just ship one improvement on its own. You need to cooperate with an existing implementation.

The other thing you are ignoring is that there were a list of **people** that created good solutions for the DAA. And, yes, they actually implemented it. Pull requests and all. Those people were individuals and didn't have a full node implementation. Nobody from BU wrote a DAA, nobody from Classic did.

As such your message of being competitive and just **doing it** makes no sense.

> I thought seriously about picking up your project when you announced that you were abandoning it. 
> Although I totally respect your decision to stop developing Classic, I think it's a crying shame that we're losing one of our implementations. 

As you are bringing this up in the context of the DAA embarrassment, I want to point out that the [Classic project closed](https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-classic-closing-its-doors-e49cd1b179b5/) for reasons completely distinct from this. It closed because its goals had been reached. It closed because the name no longer meant anything to most people.

However I do see the problem with ASIC causing very few voters (miners), then voting would be pointless since it's just the big guys deciding anyway.

"> If only 50 lines of code was all that was needed, and three of the four implementations agreed on a solution, then the failure we have is that those three implementations failed to merge the 50 lines of code they agreed on.

The miscommunication lies here; there was zero influence and ""agreement"" of either the BU and Classic implementations. We didn't care, still don't.  
This single fact brings out the misconception shown in the quoted text above, the people that agreed on a good implementation were individuals. Not implementations.

Those individuals **had** to ask for permission from one of the implementations to merge their code. As you agreed, anything else (like starting their own full-node implementation) made no sense.

It may be interesting to re-view the entire episode knowing that there were various DAA-implementations and they had been working together to ship the best one in ABC, only to be surprised by the ""nobody was doing anything, so I stepped up"" from Amaury while he was the only one that was in actual fact blocking all the other existing DAA implementations (by not pressing 'merge').

He wrote it here in rbtc.

He also wrote some other stuff that I will paraphrase here since I agree with it.

This is about to hurt your feelings, so before I do that, I want to reiterate as I have done many times that your contributions to Bitcoin will be recorded for all to see for all time.  Your work here has been invaluable and your legacy will live on.

That said.  This guy pretty much nailed it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp4qfez/

At the time that Amaury selected the DAA to go into Bitcoin ABC you wrote in frustration that the other three teams (Classic, XT, and BU) had already reached consensus on another DAA a month prior.  [That is also what you told me when we discussed it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp532n4/)

> We have been working for 3 months on improving deadalnix' failure with the EDA. We have great solutions that were universally seen as ""good enough"".

I will repeat what I told you then.  The three of you sat around apparently waiting for some permission to act, **instead of implementing (merging) the DAA that you preferred**.  That was your (and others) mistake.

If you had implemented your improved DAA a month prior to Amaury implementing a different one then I think you'd find a lot of people supporting your beef against Amaury and / or this would have never come up because we'd all just be using your DAA.

**But you didn't implement.**  You waited for permission to proceed and / or continued to bikeshed when the community needed and was asking for a solution.  (Note: this is why Bitcoin Cash forked in Aug 2017 even though the community split and should have just forked in 2015 and given us a two-year headstart, and hindsight has proven this true.)

Amaury was quick on the scene to blast you and the others for this.  Waiting around for people in authority to tell you it's OK to do what you want to do in a permissionless system makes no sense.

Amaury came onto RBTC at that time and said essentially exactly what I am telling you: it was time to make a change, and nobody else had stepped up and implemented a new DAA, so he did it.  He said at the time he didn't like the way it happened but he couldn't just sit around waiting for you guys to quit talking and start doing.  If you missed his post I encourage you to find it.  If I find it I'll share it with you.

Amaury was right.  If Classic, BU, and XT had consensus for a month on a better DAA than what Amaury implemented (as you previously told me), then it's your own fault for not implementing your DAA first, but instead sitting on it and / or bikeshedding it.  Real leadership does not involve asking for permission or holding hands and signing kumbaya.  Sitting around waiting for a blessing is why Bitcoin Cash waited *far too long* to take the initiative and cause its fork.  Here I agree 100% with Amaury.

Classic, BU, and XT all originated from a culture of ""creating a change then waiting for it to be accepted by the majority.""  This was the Stockholm syndrome situation we had under Core.  That approach failed time and time again.  Amaury is right in his criticism of this.  However, it is very hard to change the culture of a team.  Unfortunately, when it came time to actually *break things* in order to cause change, BU, XT, and Classic were all unwilling, even though people like myself had been rallying for over a year to just fucking fork already.  You guys were all unwilling to be ""that disruptive.""

In conclusion, I would have hoped that XT, Classic, and BU would have learned from what ABC ""got right"" and why that worked, and how, and seek to emulate it, not give up and then take potshots at ""what's working"" because it isn't the way you would have like to see change happen.

I thought seriously about picking up your project when you announced that you were abandoning it.   Although I totally respect your decision to stop developing Classic,  I think it's a crying shame that we're losing one of our implementations.  However I don't want to dev a project.  I just don't.  I don't have the energy, and what energy I have, would be consumed by coding, and I think I have better things to do with my time than code.

I want to reiterate: I admire all of your tenacity and all of your hard work.  I understand and sympathize with your frustration.  And you come across as a decent, honest, and hard working individual.  You are someone I have come to respect, even if we don't always agree.  And so it does affect me to hear you basically attacking Amaury for his actions, which in reality *have helped and advanced the community when others could not.*

I'll add that only miners are paid incentives by the network to build improvements.  As a dev, building a relationship with miners is going to be more and more critical as time goes forward.  I expect that in the future, if this project continues to succeed, devs will generally be paid by miners and the largest users of the system.  This shouldn't be surprising, but instead welcomed.  At least miners have an incentive to improve, not destroy, the network.

I hope that you can find some lessons learned in all of this and that by being blunt I have not offended you.  You're Dutch, right?  Bluntness ought to be normal right?  :)

Again, just in case it isn't cutting through: thank you for your years of service to Bitcoin.  We wouldn't be here without you

"> You should really reconsider and start supporting Bitcoin Cash.

I'm less hostile to Bitcoin Cash than I was a few months back. Truth is it's not *that* bad. You just send a payment, the person doesn't have to be always online like with LN, and you don't have to deal with issues like channel fraud, or opening/closing channels. Just wait for 6 confirmations, and you can be reasonably certain nothing will go wrong, and if it does, it'll be a 51% attack and public knowledge. But with LN, you have instant payments, but there are many subtle ways your channel can get messed with, and you need to always be vigilant. I'd rather be vigilant for those 6 confirmations than have to be on alert for fraud for however long I have my channel open.

It's unclear to me who would use LN. If anyone wants to buy something, it's much simpler with something like Bitcoin Cash. If you want to send really small micropayments, it's also much simpler with BCH because you don't incur fees on opening/closing channels like you would with LN. I think LN will take a very long time to work out all the UX issues, and to be developed and adopted in e-commerce. I wish people would stop hyping it so much and making it seem like it solves everything. Often these people are just hyping it for political purposes. When it comes to payments, the *simplest* tool will win.

The problem with Bitcoin Cash is that it's too centralized and easily changed. Solo developers like /u/deadalnix have way too much power to change the system. This was proven with the whole drama around the DAA algorithm and how he strong-armed his own solution and didn't coordinate with the other teams on a better solution. He also rushed out a hard fork to be adopted in a few weeks. It's very dangerous for the integrity of a cryptocurrency to have one man able to change something as critical as the difficult adjustment in just a few weeks with barely any discussion.

Another problem with Bitcoin Cash is how it's marketed. Roger Ver presents ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" as two separate versions of Bitcoin, it's a confusing mess because he tries to use Bitcoin.com to cater to both, as if they both fall under some sort of ""meta Bitcoin"". There is only one Bitcoin, just stick with that and promote one thing, not two. You can't jerk off two dicks with one hand. If he hates ""Bitcoin Core"" so much, why does he help to promote it? It makes no sense and looks ridiculous. Probably something to do with making more money from both sides, dunno.

The mining on Bitcoin Cash is too centralized (same with Bitcoin), you guys can change the PoW and get much more decentralized distribution of mining and it'll be easier to claim to be ""Satoshi's Bitcoin"", because back when Satoshi was around, mining actually used to be quite decentralized. That and putting more emphasis on running full nodes would be good, ignore frauds like Craig who harp on about how irrelevant full nodes are. Full nodes are important in letting you know that the rules of the system are being obeyed, otherwise you're basically putting all trust in miners. This is even more important when you don't dominate your PoW algorithm, it's very easy for rogue Bitcoin miners to attack you (and likely financially profitable for them too).";194;46;False;Cobra-Bitcoin;dt1lauu;Bitcoin.org has removed the low-fee part of bitcoin.

"You make three points:
1. Decentralized development
2. Decentralized mining
3. You don’t like how u/MemoryDealers runs his website Bitcoin.com 

The first argument is flawed; Bitcoin Cash has arguably more development teams working on compatible software. No one liked how the DAA algorithm was selected, including u/deadalnix himself, as he wrote publicly. However, at the time there was no process for dev consensus - the project was barely two months old and no one knew for certain that it would even survive. The EDA was wreaking havoc on both forks and needed a fix. Out of three implementations with nearly identical results under simulation, Amaury picked the one he thought was best for the client he maintains. Miners were free to reject his hard fork. They did not, and the network was successfully upgraded. This is Nakamoto consensus in action. 

The second argument is equally flawed. It’s easy to see that no single pool has even close to 51% of the hash rate. Bitcoin Cash is mined for the same reason as Bitcoin-not-Cash: it is economically advantageous to the miners. This is miners’ sole motivation for mining. If a single pool approaches 51%, they will voluntarily split to protect their investment: the network. 

And finally, take up your problems with Bitcoin.com with Mr. Ver. He isn’t “in charge” of Bitcoin Cash. The network is governed by Nakamoto consensus, nothing else.  There is no “official” Bitcoin Cash website. Anyone is free to create one. There is no central governance, because Bitcoin has never needed such a thing.

Agreed. Bitcoin has always just ... “worked“. That’s why it was being used. That’s why it had any adoption whatsoever. It just works. It was a finished product years ago in that sense. 

Creating all these hoops to jump through, software to configure and install, and advanced systems increases the barrier to entry and reduces the likelihood of participation.

Cash transactions are also instantaneous. So why use cryptocurrency at all? Except that it can be sent around the world to any country in any amount, much faster than a bank to bank transaction, and without regulation. Try smuggling a bag of cash though a border check....

> The correct solution isn't to change how we've marketed Bitcoin to millions of people, for example millions of people associate Coke as a sugar drink, this is their experience and how it's been for it's entire history, 

This irony here is quite funny. Coke originally contained cocaine and was marketed as a health drink. It was also consider high-class. It's completely changed.

Bitcoin isn't a product and it doesn't have marketing. Bitcoin.org is simply an information site which aims to give an accurate description of the technology as it is today. Today it is not feasible to send small transactions on the bitcoin network. But transactions that are sent, can be sent without fear of censorship, or the requirement of identification.

* The FAQ for this specifically mentions LN as an option for scaling (I hadn't realised how much I personally have been bamboozled by this as I assumed LN was actually an integral part of this roadmap).

1. Was signing you name to a roadmap that mentioned LN so much a mistake? 

2. Have you changed your views on this scaling roadmap?

"> It's unclear to me who would use LN.

LN isn't useless, but to me it's more a niche application rather than a replacement to on-chain applications. Entities that transfer bidirectionally all the time could benefit from transferring IOUs between the same bitcoin to avoid on chain transactions

> The problem with Bitcoin Cash is that it's too centralized and easily changed.

To me, LN is a much bigger centralization risk. You have to pick a well connected node to open your channel with, and to my understanding, the money is locked up when you open that channel. So people will most likely put most of their paycheck into one channel, and that channel is going to be a well connected node, creating centralization. Plus, once we see LN fully developed, we can decide to adapt it for Bitcoin Cash. But why cripple the underlying chain waiting for a solution that doesn't exist yet? 

> Solo developers like /u/deadalnix have way too much power to change the system.

Can the same not be said about Core? At times, it seems core has been openly hostile against other implementations. At any rate, multiple development teams work on Bitcoin Cash, and I expect the ""too much power to one team"" problem to lessen as the project gets bigger

"So you don't always need to be online with LN, that's why we have segwit.  LN is up and running and it's very much in the beta stages but it's growing really well. 

Segwit is 2 things. It fixes transaction malleability so we can have LN and not have to be online all the time and the possibility for better smart contracts (MAST) and it's a blocksize increase if you adopt segwit.  So it was proposed as a compromise with a way to motivate people to using segwit.  LN going on mainnet recently seems to have improved segwit adoption so that's cool, but it's going to take time.  

BCH can't be compared to Bitcoin.  It doesn't have the traffic and therefore doesn't need 1 mb blocks and sure as hell doesn't need 8mb blocks.  

LTC has their won LN and what is really cool there is cross chain atomic swaps.  Oh bitcoin's fees are too high for you? You can swap into LTC and there you go.  

For BCH to have a practical LN they are going to need to implement the very segwit they fought so hard against or at least some transaction malleability fix.. but considering their devs are too busy copying bitcoin commits I doubt they would waste time doing something different.  

All the other bitcoin forks are pretty much dead.  I'd expect a lot of them to be out by years end.  BCH I expect to stick around .. I mean blockchains are resilient after all.   They have great market penetration too.

A young girl walking along a mountain path to her grandmother's house heard a rustle at her feet. Looking down, she saw a snake, but before she could react, the snake spoke to her.

Suddenly, she said, ""I believe you. I will save you. All living things deserve to be treated with kindness.""

She then reached over, put the snake gently under her coat and continued toward her grandmother's house.

I think you misunderstood pow and bitcoin decentralization. It doesn't mean that every random joe is mining - if that was the case, a nation state could easily conduct a sybil attack.

sha256 pow isn't perfect, but it works. we should stick with it until we're confident that another algorithm would be superior.

Of course.

I see no problem with that, Roger Ver do not own bitcoin cash, he promotes, and what he promotes appears to me as completely true: you can't claim bitcoin name only because you did a ""soft fork"".

> The mining on Bitcoin Cash is too centralized (same with Bitcoin), you guys can change the PoW and get much more decentralized distribution of mining

Nah, if you mean something like Equihash, on one hand you get more people able to buy equipment and mine in a pool, but this is not exactly decentralization, and if you mine solo you will mine a bunch of orphan blocks. It is also easier to do a botnet attack with non ASIC gear.

> Full nodes are important in letting you know that the rules of the system are being obeyed

No, one can keep only *last full blocks* and check their UTXO, it is absolutely USELESS for personal security to keep the full blockchain, you are spitting out a mantra which was repeated as truth without nothing technical to back it up. Say nodes keep only lats 144 full blocks, it is still totally visible if blocks start to be rewritten because the merkle root of current blocks would change and the UTXOs too.

"> 'm less hostile to Bitcoin Cash than I was a few months back. Truth is it's not that bad. You just send a payment, the person doesn't have to be always online like with LN, and you don't have to deal with issues like channel fraud, or opening/closing channels. Just wait for 6 confirmations, and you can be reasonably certain nothing will go wrong, and if it does, it'll be a 51% attack and public knowledge. But with LN, you have instant payments, but there are many subtle ways your channel can get messed with, and you need to always be vigilant. I'd rather be vigilant for those 6 confirmations than have to be on alert for fraud for however long I have my channel open.

I completely agree. 

Don't forget where LN is coming from. It is a technical solution trying to fix a stupid and very bad political decision: Core supporting the agenda of Blockstream to *force* users off the chain into into side-chains.

> It's unclear to me who would use LN. If anyone wants to buy something, it's much simpler with something like Bitcoin Cash. If you want to send really small micropayments, it's also much simpler with BCH because you don't incur fees on opening/closing channels like you would with LN. I think LN will take a very long time to work out all the UX issues, and to be developed and adopted in e-commerce. I wish people would stop hyping it so much and making it seem like it solves everything. Often these people are just hyping it for political purposes. When it comes to payments, the simplest tool will win.

I agree. LN is actually similar to SegWit. SegWit was/is hyped to make it seem it will solve everything. Similar to LN it is a technical solution to the same bad political decision. In the end sending a real Bitcoin transaction is simpler (and safer) than SegWit, so adoption stagnates at about 10%. 

The only way to fix all those LN issues is in fact by transforming it into a banking system. I am sure neither of us wants that to happen.

> The problem with Bitcoin Cash is that it's too centralized and easily changed. Solo developers like /u/deadalnix
> [+13] have way too much power to change the system. This was proven with the whole drama around the DAA algorithm and how he strong-armed his own solution and didn't coordinate with the other teams on a better solution. He also rushed out a hard fork to be adopted in a few weeks. It's very dangerous for the integrity of a cryptocurrency to have one man able to change something as critical as the difficult adjustment in just a few weeks with barely any discussion.

I think the EDA removal hard fork was a special case. The several teams seem to have established a more formal cooperation process in the meantime. Apparently there was a joint meeting where they have agreed on some future roadmap. With your support the Bitcoin Cash development community would grow a lot and all those processes would mature even more.

> Another problem with Bitcoin Cash is how it's marketed. Roger Ver presents ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" as two separate versions of Bitcoin, it's a confusing mess because he tries to use Bitcoin.com to cater to both, as if they both fall under some sort of ""meta Bitcoin"". There is only one Bitcoin, just stick with that and promote one thing, not two. You can't jerk off two dicks with one hand. If he hates ""Bitcoin Core"" so much, why does he help to promote it? It makes no sense and looks ridiculous. Probably something to do with making more money from both sides, dunno.

Roger is not some Bitcoin Cash spokesperson or anything. But I agree with you, he should really remove Bitcoin Core and stop supporting it completely. But since this is his very own web site he can of course do as he pleases.

> The mining on Bitcoin Cash is too centralized (same with Bitcoin), you guys can change the PoW and get much more decentralized distribution of mining and it'll be easier to claim to be ""Satoshi's Bitcoin"", because back when Satoshi was around, mining actually used to be quite decentralized. That and putting more emphasis on running full nodes would be good, ignore frauds like Craig who harp on about how irrelevant full nodes are. Full nodes are important in letting you know that the rules of the system are being obeyed, otherwise you're basically putting all trust in miners. This is even more important when you don't dominate your PoW algorithm, it's very easy for rogue Bitcoin miners to attack you (and likely financially profitable for them too).

Honestly I think changing PoW is more likely for Core, I doubt that Bitcoin Cash will do that anytime soon. Anyway, with your endorsement Bitcoin Cash could gain the majority of miners within a short time frame. And that would make it way more decentralized. See, on Bitcoin Cash even very small miners can participate, a feat already impossible on Core because of the huge fees.

I agree that full nodes are important. Not only to enforce network rules but also to give folks a way to be part of the network. But keep in mind, that Craig, like Roger, is not some spokesperson. He is just someone that tweets a lot.

Since we agree on almost everything, I know that you did come to the conclusion, that Bitcoin Cash is actually the ""real"" Bitcoin, while Bitcoin Core is burying itself under more and more completely unnecessary complexity. Sadly I know that with your position you cannot simply jump ship, even when it would actually be the right thing to do.";10;2;False;coin-master;dt1qq5b;Bitcoin.org has removed the low-fee part of bitcoin.

"My answer is because here in Venezuela many people handle the anti-capitalist hypothesis that low wages are due to the greed of foreign entrepreneurs and not because they are forcing us from the government to have poor salaries. Then people blame people who offer work at market price (and even a little more) because it compares directly with the price of such activities in the countries of the contracting (pointing to a false exploitation of the ""global north"" towards the "" global south ""). As for the minimum wages, I simply take advantage of the moment to expose such facts since the subjects were related, and because I believe that a greater global explanation could make possible a better understanding of such subjects.

If it is true that it helps a lot if voluntarily these salaries that are offered are a little greater than those common in Venezuela, I do not deny that, u/linzerdshaffen/ is right, however I wanted to explain to him that even though foreigners offer us a price in dollars equivalent to the poor market price within the country, that is part of the process of economic recovery that we must look for (due to the increase in demand and the natural balance tendency of the economy).

"""nobody wants to be anything"" still you get offended if we take Bitcoin name or Stolen Bitcoin logo design out of BCash and not to mention the shit ton of posts here about how BCash is the real Bitcoin. if your coin is so revolutionary and unique then how about we start from a unique name and logo. 
   i dont own both but lets be real BCash community tries so hard to trick new investors into thinking that BCash is ""Real Bitcoin"". your name, logo and subreddit name, instead of BCH, they chose BTC? lol not gonna call every other alt coin ""Bitcoin Gold"" , ""E Bitcoin"" or "" Bitcoin Cash"" ";1;2;False;Inder_R1;dt16p4d;Bitcoin Cash proving to be the real Bitcoin in Venezuela by actually helping people.;https://i.redd.it/mejbcesoxeb01.jpg

I never said that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. It carries the spirit of the real bitcoin, but we all know it is a fork. A better one, but a fork still. Nobody is tricking anyone. If the coin is named bitcoin cash, it cannot have the litecoin logo, or can it? =);1;1;False;linzerdshaffen;dt19zlr;Bitcoin Cash proving to be the real Bitcoin in Venezuela by actually helping people.;https://i.redd.it/mejbcesoxeb01.jpg

It's not likely at the moment as demand for it is small. We are opening up the marketplace to more third-party developers and may see this come up then. What I think is much more likely is an official integration with major exchanges. It's **not** in the works but I'd love to see it happen.;2;0;False;michaeltieso;dt28vnl;WooCommerce brings Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its 380,000 online retailers.;https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/01/20/woocommerce-store-owners-will-soon-get-another-plugin-accept-bitcoin-cash/

"I believe you're missing something. You correctly mention that the path found does not have to be optimal (which is something I've seen many here assume, and then use to claim that no known distributed algorithm exists for solving the problem).

You also correctly mention that there's no need to know the exact capacities of each node. It's ok if occasionally a route fails, it can try another in a few seconds.

But then you say this:

>Even so, the path finder needs to know of any payment that is large enough to change that approximate balance; or, if many small payments are made through the channel, it must be notified every time they add up to a significant amount.

So this is already a nice compression of the information, only significant changes to the channel capacity have to be reported. 

But these changes can be canceled with payments going in the reverse direction, so you can compress the information even further because these changes won't always be unbalanced.

>If there were a million nodes, each making one significant LN payment per day, each node would have to receive and process one million notifications per day.

This is multiple orders of magnitude the number of nodes that currently exist, so it's hardly an immediate scale requirement.

>This is actually worse scaling than the original bitcoin network with SPV client wallets.

But it's several times better than miner and node scaling, which is what matters. You can also have light LN clients that behave similarly to SPV.

>Either way, any such server would have to know about every significant payment made by every user. So the original promise of confidentiality would be lost.

Only the capacity change, which can be fuzzed and has no reason to include the sender or receiver of the transaction (which isn't even known with onion routing).

>A failure rate of 1% may be high enough to drive users away. 

That just means that occasionally a payment takes 2x or 3x the amount of time to happen. Since usually payments will take a few seconds that means a 3x delay takes maybe 10 or 15 seconds, I don't think anyone will stop using the system because of that. 

>Moreover, once the path finder has chosen a path, the selected middlemen nodes must ""freeze"" the relevant channels until the payment is negotiated and executed, or the negotiation fails.

This only takes a few seconds. 

>The ""path finding problem"" is inventing an algorithm that would be decentralized, reliable, and scale better than the original bitcoin network. And would preserve the confidentiality of payments of the original LN concept. It is not obvious that such an algorithm will ever be found...

Why do you think this is a significantly different from BGP routing on the Internet?
