"**Silk Road (marketplace)**

Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Initially there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction.

"No sir, not obviously. The fact that someone may knowingly and passively let changes happen (fee market, block congestion etc) has equal weight with someone actively changing things to prevent easily foreseeable outcomes. The fact that the changes in the nature of Bitcoin were passively allowed to happen does not give any special entitlement to the ones in charge.  
Take this for example: Lets assume that there is a bug discovered in the Bitcoin protocol that will allow 41 million bitcoins be mined instead of 21, and it requires a hard fork to fix. But then the community is divided, because some believe that 41 million is better, so they don't go along with the hard fork, they prefer the 41 million version.
