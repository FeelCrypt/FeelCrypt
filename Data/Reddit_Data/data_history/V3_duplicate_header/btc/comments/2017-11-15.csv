"Hehe r/btc isnt that much different from r/bitcoin as people like to think. As soon as you mention something else you get downvoted.

so many things to mention, but my favorite parts are:
NEO is more like a share. And by holding NEO you get GAS as a dividend. I Sold all my mining equipment in the summer, and I make more from GAS than I did mining ethereum then. 
Gas will be used for the DAPPS and other things like voting.

It supports many different programming languages instead of just one. Which will make it a lot more reachable for programmers.

"Well there's two questions here- onramps/offramps, and transaction cost.  

As /u/jessquit was getting at, if the transaction cost is high, if the coin is treated like a digital investment that costs $5-$10 to transact (but nobody cares when they move $1000+ around at a time), then it is of no more use to someone in rural Zimbabwe than buying gold coins.  
OTOH if the transaction cost is low, then it becomes useful for day to day purchases.  

That leads into the second thing- onramps/offramps.  In many countries, converting between fiat and crypto is heavily regulated.  OTOH if you can transact purely in crypto, without ever needing to go back to fiat (you get paid in crypto and you buy things in crypto), that opens up all kinds of uses in developing markets and places with shitty economic policy / worthless fiat.  

That's what I think 'small blockers' miss- sure it's good to have a long term store of value, but that store of value becomes much more valuable when you can spend it on stuff.

"> Stop listening to just reddit.

This may actually be good advice.  I've had a bit more time to watch crypto lately, and thus have been studying the space from a few different perspectives...  made me realize how compared to the 'old days' (2012-2014ish; pre-/r/bitcoin-censorship) a great deal of today's BTC/BCH discussion on Reddit is largely just reactionary noise.  

This last weekend's market moves I think are evidence of that.  I've looked over the charts and I don't think this was just a case of 'miners chase the block reward', it seems too well coordinated for that.  I think the miners (who are not stupid) had a pre-hardfork strategy to move hash power around during a period of high BTC network load and BCH uncertainty thus influence the price of both BTC and BCH.  This strategy was obviously quite successful.  At least that's my conclusion.  

But do we discuss that intelligently here?  Do we even acknowledge that miners might have a strategy behind what they do?  No of course not.  /r/btc says 'the flippening is happening!!!!11' and goes nuts, /r/bitcoin says 'Jihan and Roger are dishonest con men have fun with your tanking scamcoin suckers this is finally the end of fake satoshi's shitcoincash pump and dump scheme'.  
Neither one really adds much of anything useful.

Then I go even to subreddits of other cryptos and I see a whole different type of discussion- few memes / shitposts / low effort stuff, lots of people actually learning about the tech and asking smart questions and working on new solutions and figuring out how to push adoption.  It's really quite striking.  

Then again, maybe the Reddit BTC/BCH community is an analogue to modern America- we've become insular, focused on our own squabbles and ignoring the world at large...  kinda sad IMHO.

"> Which supply chains?

All. Food's is the most important, it'll affect social stability instantly. Read about famines in Soviet Union in USA in the first half of XX century. It has nothing to do with production capacity and all to do with prices, inflation of paper money and supply chains

> that doesn't stop governments from being able to tax people

Cos each big enough merchant had to have a bank account and a license. Open blockchains already are changing that. Merchants will go above all jurisdictions. Factories and fields will follow them in the 2nd stage (when police forces of nations will start to break down over financial turmoil, read about what's happening in Ukraine now). Thousands of businesses will be abandoned

Cos no agency on Earth would be able to trace anyone's personal finance if this person contribute a little effort to disentangle his identity public keys. Analitical graph'll become a little cheaper to execute than potentially collected taxes and poof... There's no bank for authorities to call to find your money

"I'm not a lawyer, but I've been a proprietor, board member, and treasurer of a not-for-profit corporation for over a half decade. I'm not an expert, but I have a pretty good foundation in business practices, donations, and liability to customers and donors.

Theymos was essentially running a business as sole proprietor of one or more websites. He offered his services for free and solicited ""donations"" towards his expressed expenses. Users ""donated"" to his business. These are essentially gifts from one person to another. There is no implied or guaranteed service in exchange for these gifts. There was clearly no formal or informal investment in the business, as there was no means of conferring any stake in his business and he never referred to these ""donations"" as investments.

Because he is the sole proprietor of his business, he can use the businesses funds on anything he wants and say it was used toward fulfilling his promise to develop the business. Money is fungible, so there is no way to say what money was used for what business activities. His promises are also incredibly vague.

Everyone who donated is like a venture capitalist that backed a failed business. Only they did it without any chance of ever getting their investment back. 

He could have taken all the money and hired literally anyone to write a single line of code, paid it all to that person, and closed up shop as a defunct business and it still wouldn't be fraud, because he did use the funds toward improving his business, and it failed. Even if you could prove that was his plan all along, its nearly impossible to prove that you were materially damaged by his failure to deliver, because you have no stake in the business and there was no clear sale of any good or service in exchange for your donation.

This is essentially the problem with any gofundme, indiegogo, or kickstarter project. There is no protection in crowdfunding beyond whatever the intermediary organization is willing to get both parties to agree to provide and is capable of enforcing. In the case of cryptocurrency donations, there is no intermediary.

"> 40 Million dollars to develop a shit looking subreddit and a shit looking bitcointalk forum

Comments like this give theymos an excuse to remove discussions on this topic. You can’t take the dollar value of the donations *today* and ask why the forum doesn’t look like $40 million software. At the time the donations were collected it was about $10k.

If theymos had actually sat on the money until now, the explanation for why there isn’t a new fancy forum would be “because I haven’t ever paid anyone to build it”, wouldn’t it?

And if theymos did pay people to develop new forum software, then he would have done so at much lower valuations than the current near all time high, wouldn’t he?";2;1;False;tophernator;dpuheiv;Saw a post asking Theymos where the donated 6900 BTC is disappear before my very eyes.

"To be perfectly honest: very few people know about this in the grand scheme. Your original comment is a testament to that. Have you heard discussions about censorship and bans here prior to you gaining more info about Theymos?

r/btc gets a lot of heat for being an echo chamber in the sense that it's users are consistently discussing the prevalent censorship in many of Bitcoin's largest forums and resource sites. But it begs a series of follow up questions: Why is it that censorship and all of these bans are occurring in the first place? Why is it that an entire mod team underneath Theymos, (the head moderator), condone, support, and freely associate themselves with this type of entity and activity?

There is no clear cut answer to these questions simply because of the convoluted nature of everything. If I could have a small bit of hubris and make a recommendation for you, dig into the subject with focus. This rabbit hole you're enquiring after is extremely deep.

I have been in computer science for 10 years and I assure you it isn't possible. It is not just building(copying) 10 gb blocks but also mine them - so basically you need to hash the 10gb block over and over and over again until you find the solution. All of this should happen in around 10 minutes - which is ridiculous (you'd know if you understand algorithmic time and space complexities). So the only way forward is to make the mathematical puzzles easier and this in turn will compromise security. 

And as a sole user of distributed currency, I cannot download and verify the blocks myself because we now have a 10gb block every 10 minutes. 

Increasing block size isn't the solution. We need a solution which can scale exponentially and not linearly. I am so saddened some marketing assholes are promoting this bullshit of a big block chain ideology and people are buying into it. Those people aren't even developers / computer scientists - they don't know shit about this and so do you!

There was a reason why the core team didn't agree to increasing block size. They could have went ahead with it because it is the easiest thing to do but not the right thing to do. Payment channels / lightning networks are the future. But when that happens there will be people who just copy and with some marketing do the same thing like they are doing it with bitcoin (bitcoin cash)";1;1;False;;dpujaeb;Mempool breaks resistance trend, strong support at ~87500.

Default chain cannot handle it. You would need 2gb to 10 fb blocks to scale to the entire world. By having this larger size, you have taken out what makes bitcoin unique - distributed. I’d rather have a coin which is highly expensive and hard to use over a block chain technology with centralized miners.

Nope.

It was an invention, just not by Satoshi.

For mining, Satoshi used the Proof-of-work concept from Hash Cash.

Which Adam Back pretended he invented in 1997, thus the laughable ""Bitcoin is Hash Cash with inflation control"" quote.

But actually Adam Back only regurgitated and repackaged Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor's ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"" from 1992.

Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor's paper is still on the hashcash.org website.

For mining, Satoshi used the Proof-of-work concept from Hash Cash.

Which Adam Back pretended he invented in 1997, thus the laughable ""Bitcoin is Hash Cash with inflation control"" quote.

But actually Adam Back only regurgitated and repackaged Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor's ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"" from 1992.

Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor's paper is still on the hashcash.org website.

>http://www.hashcash.org/papers/pvp.pdf

>Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor

>""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail""

>First presented in Crypto'92.

And:

>Also, do you think that the successful merging of two technologies is not an invention in its own right?

If I glue a banana and an apple together and then smash your head with it, did I invent a new weapon or did I invent a new fruit?

Satoshi glued a few old tech together to create a new economic and financial solution (I am going to skip the part where Satoshi was inspired by Wei-Dai's b-money), Satoshi didn't invent any of the technology used.

"I'm replying to both your guys' comments. (Paging u/ladle3000 )

First of all, both of you need to read this in its entirety, if you haven't already. [link 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BitcoinMarkets)

The above link helps explain why Bitcoin became so political in the first place.

Bitcoin Cash is much more than just bigger blocks. One of the most important things it does is it changes the leadership (see link 1). Secondly, it avoids segwit (more on that in link 3). And thirdly, it restores Bitcoin to being about making it a form of _money_, rather than a settlement layer. Bitcoin is about liberty, delivered via economics, and executed through technology; in that order. The current path for the old Bitcoin chain completely misses this, and has been completely altered off course. Bitcoin Cash keeps this alive though. And in this spirit, Gavin Andresen, the man whom Satoshi himself handed the Bitcoin project too when he left, said a few days ago that Bitcoin Cash is (basically) the real Bitcoin. [link 2](https://bitsonline.com/gavin-andresen-endorses-bitcoin-cash/).

I addressed the issues with Segwit, and additionally, the concerns about mining centralization, in another comment I wrote earlier. [link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cbvel/can_someone_educate_me/dpopizn/)

Regarding your concern that Bitcoin Cash may end up just having the same problems again in the future, you need to understand something: The problem with Bitcoin is not in a lack of unity, it's in the _governance model_. I can not possibly recommend this PDF enough, explaining how Bitcoin Cash can not only not have those problems, but can _thrive_. [link 4](https://bitcoincash.org/letter-from-the-ceo.pdf)

The concern that bigger blocks are not a long-term solution is a valid concern, one which I have thought about a lot myself. There are a lot of things you have to understand. I addressed some of those things in a comment I left here. [link 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cfwjh/ex_core_supporter_here/dppwib2/?context=3)

Hope this answers some questions.

Edit: Things like the Lightning Network and other applications will work much better with larger blocks. 1 megabyte is extremely, woefully small. There is no good argument for keeping blocks limited to such a size. The only one given so far is that 'everyone needs to be able to run their own node' in order for the network to be decentralized, but this statement comes apart for many reasons, and was never the intended long-term configuration. Satoshi wrote about it.

> ""The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.""";6;0;False;;dpu9yyo;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cuwyx/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

">Have you ever seen any technical calculations to support the statement 'big blocks will lead to centralization'. 

'Centralization' is a false argument used by Blockstream Core to confuse newbies.

Anything that costs money to make or use will be centralized, because money is not evenly distributed. No matter how you shuffle things around, if it costs money, then in the end the rich will get richer and they can buy more and use more of it, creating centralization.

Blockstream Core wants to keep blocks at 1MB so they're selling the bullshit idea that everyone's Raspberry Pi should be able to run full nodes, and that miners should give power back to the users.

That sounds great to newbies, until you realize that means in the future, anyone running a large botnet, or any group of billionaires can work together and pay Amazon $100million a month to run 500million full nodes and take over a trillion dollar system (centralization).

Full nodes in Bitcoin is just a unique ip and port pair, you can run 50000 full nodes on the same server, using the same disk, simply by redirecting all 50000 ip:port into the same Bitcoin server process, that is, you run one server, but pretend you have 50000 full nodes by opening 50000 ports for it.

If you have capital, you can also buy a few blocks of IP and run a huge full nodes farm, you can redirect all the ip and all the ports into the same machine, run millions of ""full nodes"" using a dozens of servers (centralization), there's no way to tell the difference because every full nodes are supposed to look exactly the same, except the ip and port.

Blockstream Core also complain about Bitmain dominating the ASIC chip processing, claiming it is centralization, but if we use desktop CPU or GPU, they're also centralized by Intel/AMD/Nvidia, they're also also full of patents. Chip manufacturing is also dominated by a few companies such as ASML, when Intel say they will be making 7nm chips, they're actually using patented technology from ASML

In the end almost everything down the chain is centralized, but Blockstream Core doesn't want you to know that. They want you to focus on attacking people that help made Bitcoin Bitcoin. From Satoshi, the Bitcoin whitepaper, to the miners, Blockstream Core spent huge resources attacking them.

Blockstream Core wants power for themselves, Bitcoin was designed to remove human from the decision making process and only listen to hash power, so Blockstream Core kept attacking miners using straw man arguments, such as saying miners have too much power.

But what it comes down to is miners don't actually have power just by being miners, they have power by calculating the Bitcoin math. The math that made Bitcoin Bitcoin.

If you attack the miners, and take power away from miners, all you're doing is take security away from Bitcoin, because you're taking power away from the Bitcoin math process itself. It's this math that had protected Bitcoin from attacks for 8 years.

Blockstream Core have been trying to discredit and change Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepapers for years, because the way Bitcoin was designed to work, takes power away from the banks.

Blockstream Core is a rogue organization dedicated to make Bitcoin useless.

 You fail to define decentralised.  

> and that fees will increase over time.

This is true, as people move to Bitcoin Cash the fees may increase, however this will be mitigated by the fact that supply of block space will only limited by the economics of mining.

In fact it will be decades before the lack of a block subsidy even becomes an issue, as the dollar valuation of Bitcoin Cash continues to rise mitigating reward halvings.

As the number of transactions per block increases, then the fee per transaction can still continue to remain small, and the total amount of fees can in time replace the subsidy.

"opposition to Core's roadmap is censored, if you are a developer on the team you will get axed. Jeff G wound up being responsible for implementing Segwit he was an opponent. 

Not to mention the second or 3rd scaling conference made it off topic to discuss scaling by any means involving a hard for or a block size increase, The code of conduct issued to every attendee made it clear that people discussing hard forks would be removed by security. The core organisers even issued shirts that said ACT implying in geek ""i agree"" 

that's censorship at the max. 

the reasons to oppose Segwit are easy to understand you just need to do some independent analysts. 

No point in me convincing you, miners have already been tricked into activating it, if it's a good idea it'll flourish in the market. 

The Bitcoin Cash fork is a fork to avoid Segwit. $21,582,003,236.00 think its a shit idea at this time. ";1;0;False;Adrian-X;dptxsnc;Confessions of a Core Supporter;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7csoxe/confessions_of_a_core_supporter/

"Moderating off-topic or dishonest pump & dumps != censorship

Guidelines:

* News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.
* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol **without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.**

Mods gonna mod.

Bitcoin Cash does not have overwhelming consensus. It's a shitty attempt of a hardfork takeover.

Edit: I need to clarify that I'm all **for** bigger blocks, heck make em 32MB! or bigger! but there needs to be a a) clear path to upgrade/fork b) a good voting/signalling time (like segwit) and c) overwhelming concensus by exchanges *and* users that this is the way forward. Bitcoin Cash lacks all this, it was rushed, felt rushed and feels wrong.

"Huh. I was sure you were trolling. I apologize.

I guess you're right that a thing can't be insulted. But people who care about a thing can be indirectly insulted as happened in this case. Posting in /r/btc that bitcoin cash is shitty is not going to win you a lot of friends.

"Well if you feel offended I would like to apologise for that, but it's still my opinion. If someone would say ""Bitcoin sux! boooooo"" I would never feel offended though. 

I'm not trolling. I clearly explained why I think it was a botched attempt to scale Bitcoin. The metrics are clear to me, it's not sold as Bitcoin on the markets, priced as such or has the community behind it. 

How I see it, Bitcoin is still not scaled (boo) and now we have an altcoin that claims to be something it's not. There are better alternatives in that case (LTC or even Doge (lol doge) for speed, etc.)).

>It's a direct insult to BCH

This I find strange though. How can a ""thing"" be insulted?

Likewise, if you paint a picture I'm free to call it pretty or ugly, right? I'm not judging you as a person, just the painting. Constructive criticism. But maybe I should have used the word ""failed, low quality"" instead of ""shitty"".

I long for the day Bitcoin's blocksize increases with the entire (95%?) community behind it. Right now we're falling apart.

Starting to look like a psyop Divide and conquer, but that's a discussion on a whole new level.

The bad thing about /r/btc (well, one of them) is we get trolled continually.

If you have critiques of BCH you're welcome to air them in the spirit of intellectual inquiry and if you have anything novel to say you might very well start a conversation.

But if all you have is the same old same old you'll probably be ignored and if what you actually do is just say it's ""shitty"" how are we even supposed to know what your views really are? Why should anyone waste their time on that?

"a) clear path: Yes, it was announced almost a year, and there was little resistance to segwit being activated. I remember clearly that Litecoin was first and it went very smooth.

b) signalling/voting. There was an 80%-ish level of nodes running segwit enabled full nodes. In july 80% of the miners signalled segwit (not to be confused with segwit2x). (https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/segwit-reaches-80-of-the-hashrate-likely-to-soon-activate/)

c) the exchanges did not create second tickers like BitcoinSW or something, als I didn't see much users (except from hardcore Cash supporters) complaining. 

Segwit - BIP91/BIP148  - was a softfork by the way.

So back to your question:

>So should we disable/remove segwit in your opinion? 

No, this means rolling back months of blocks, this requires a hardfork to undo.

>Only 30% wanted just segwit,

where did you get that number? But t doesn't matter, it's a softfork, you can ignore the data and be fine.

"Even as a Bitcoin Cash fan, I find it annoying when people stick posters on poles (""lost dog"", ""yard sale"", ""Bitcoin Cash"", etc.) and never come back to remove them. The posters gather dirt, get scrunched in bad weather, and generally end up making the neighborhood look ugly and seedy.

Now if you're going to retrace your paths, and replace the old worn-out posters with new ones every so often so they never make the area look untidy, then that's great. Most people don't bother.

"There is a hacked together google doc:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVVMXkQ_-NNccJ4X7Qx0toHXpVTdYjR0T143f9CNcEI/edit?usp=sharing

Printing costs is a complicated formula.  At the very high end, you can pay as much as 50 cents per page at a Fedex Kinkos.  Please don't pay these rates.  At the low end, if you invest a 100$ into a cost effective per page office printer and buy off brand ink, you can get the costs down to ~1-2 cents a page.

The other major variable cost, surprisingly, is the clear box tape used to put up the posters.  a 50 yard roll of tape cost `4-8 dollars and can put up 30-40 posters.  

If you get a staple gun (~20$), staples are basically free.  But things can only be stapled in so many places.

And, of course, the biggest variable cost by far, is your time spent putting up the posters.  (I myself would just be playing videos games, or posting on reddit anyway though....).  

I'd also recommend having some sort of quick, by foot, mode of transportation.  I already have a scooter, so I am able to zip around the city very quickly.  Also, finding a good density of highly trafficed locations is important.";9;2;False;stale2000;dpuj4wg;Tearing down my Bitcoin Cash San Francisco posters, are you? Well I just put up more.

Bitcoin needs to permeate public consciousness further to set itself as a means of paying for stuff. My dad may have Bitcoin and may see “bitcoin accepted here” but never use it cause he doesn’t make that connection. 

But if he sees “Bitcoin Cash” it might be easier since it’s cash and he’s been paying for stuff his entire life w it.

I am just a random guy living in San Francisco.  I am not some bitcoin company founder, PR person, or marketing expert.  All I did was slap together a poster, with bad editing skills, using copy pasted logos, made by other people.  And then I printed them out and posted them around the city.

You too can do any of this any more!  Just go DO something, and then if it fails, well you'll learn from your mistakes, iterate, and do it better next time.  

I've certainly learned a whole lot of what goes into posting flyers around the city, along the way of doing it.  

But most importantly, whatever it is you do, document it and let other people in the community know what you did.  Whether it be by taking a photo and posting it here on this subreddit, or any other channel.  

That way you can get feedback, and inspire others to do things as well.  ";11;1;False;stale2000;dpul373;Tearing down my Bitcoin Cash San Francisco posters, are you? Well I just put up more. Your move r/bitcoin;https://i.redd.it/qfjjyn4nx2yz.jpg

Agreed. It's also very important is that many BCH accepting businesses come aboard.

>The natural trend of BCH is to head to zero as people get access to it and unload it for BTC.

I did the opposite. It remains to be seen how others react, but I'm fairly  confident of my position right now. Much like I was for BTC from 2013 to exit about a week ago (+9400%) or XMR from 2014 to current date (+23900%), percentages against USD.

Most important for me would be to get rid of using legacy banking. I want to do business directly in cryptocurrencies, but sadly BTC is now pretty much useless for that (due to high fees). Maybe it will be better in the future, with LN and other second layer solutions, but that's uncertain.

"If by the ""world"" you mean the bitcoin equivalent of retail investors paying $19.95 a trade on Schwab, then yes.  But retail investor panic is a capitulation and signals a bottom which is *exactly what happened over the weekend*.  See also October 2008.  All that red is the dumb money cashing out.  And they were selling to investors. Just like this weekend.

Most of what you are writing is confused nonsense.  Bitcoin was not created to replace V or MC.  It was created to replace (or coexist along side with) currency as a store of value. A digital gold.  

Second, Bitcoin was not intended to replace VISA or MC be
cause those work perfectly well.   The retail segment of the S&P500 is not claiming that they are broken.  Bitcoin as a payment mechanism (i.e. the blockchain and exchanges) was created to address payments in those economic and financial circumstances where V and MC aren't available or don't work, i.e. the black markets, movement of capital across borders  where national laws restrict or outright ban it, a store of value when banks and the financial system are unreliable (e.g. Cyprus a few years ago).

So yes, the retail investors couldn't get their confirmations right away.  So?  In 1987 when the stock market crashed in the US, not only were confirmations hopelessly delayed, but the actual tape was delayed by several hours, meaning there wasn't accurate price information for anyone until well into the night after the market closed.

The world didn't end.  No one thought that a late tape mean that the US stock market was a rigged sham.  Everything was fine.

The same thing will happen here.  If you plan to hold BTC for a long time, then the confirmation time really doesn't matter.  If you want to day trade, then yes it matters.  But the primary purposed of BTC isn't to allow daytraders to gamble just like the stock market isn't either.  You *can* use it for that, but don't complain when it doesn't re-engineer itself to suit your needs.

And no, I'm not a trader.  I'm not that stupid.  I don't bet on penny stocks, don't gamble on options or futures, and don't try to time the market.

Bitcoin Cash has a mining centralization problem right now that needs to be addressed. You can't hoard mining power and expect the community to want to ""invest"" in a system that is rigged against them. We already have the USD if we want to do that!

Ultimately, it's about spreading the wealth around the best way you can. BTC has Alts. If BCH thinks it can go it alone, then you won't get any one who wants to invest in the ecosystem.

* Bitcoin Cash is not just yet another alt-coin, it is the focal point for anyone loving Bitcoin and wanting to use it as a means of payment and a currency.

"Store of value. Brand awareness.

USD is WAY better at moving ""stable"" money around than BCH. So BCH isn't competing with Bitcoin. It's competing with the dollar. I'll trade transaction time in BTC for better store of value.

Not saying that won't change, but BCH hasn't come out with an L2 strategy yet. And having mining centralized around Bitmain is a terrible idea.

Ask everyone who ""pre-ordered"" dash miners or litecoin miners. The latest batch of Dash miners FINALLY arrived (ordered 3 months ago). In that time, Bitmain gave all the Chinese miners the machines first and pushed the difficulty up giving them a huge advantage.

Mining is a completely rigged game at this point and will kill BCH. There is a reason everyone has moved to Equihash GPU mining. It's a safer strategy to support the BTC ecosystem.

This is about sustaining the Bitcoin ecosystem. NOT burning the king because you don't like a delayed L2 execution. If you VALUE store of value, MARKET CAP is king. Sorry, but that's just how it works.

It seems like we have the same end goal for crypto but you have some misunderstandings and that is why you are pro BCH.

"End of the day though, in my current opinion, I think BCH is good for the P2P day to day stuff and BTC is good for large-transaction/storage.

That is far from a concrete final statement, it is merely my current opinion on the matter.

BCH very likely can take over the ""large transaction / storage"" section I have BTC set for in my head, but right now I don't see it so I don't do it.

When BCH becomes big enough to allow small transactions between a kid mowing a lawn and the old man paying as well as allowing international overseas business deals, then I'll be praising it.

Just... As it stands now, it's just ineffective for what I use it for and, after today, it's becoming a bit concerning how much some BCH users are pushing HARD to convince BTC holders to swap over to BCH. 

Not to say you did or have, but if you read this full comment thread.... Well, at least a few users are acting pretty maliciously towards BTC for reasons that are making me question their motive. 

Some of these people are WAY too concerned with what I do with my money or how I invest for it to feel natural and nonforced... 

Maybe it's just the state of the last few days of drama but some of the comments here today have shook me into being a lot more cautious with regards to BCH than I was 5 days ago. But I dont see people telling BCH holders to sell all their assets for BTC; The few comments of those types tend to be ""Lol well have fun with BCH while I make money off BTC"", which is what I'd expect BCH'ers to say to BTC holders....

The ""Almost one full BTC"" thing is my personal investment ""account"", I have a separate amount and account for business. I just don't feel comfortable talking about the potential valuation/holdings of my business on Reddit, might open me up to some people looking for a hack / dox target?

So, yeah, my goal of 1 BTC is not there yet, it's my ""personal investment"" and is raked in some non-business ideals decisions. ""I like Bitcoin because I've known it"" ""It feels safe"" y'know, not technical decisions.

The business side is more technical, and as such, is more pliable and willing to change to BCH acceptance by others based on customers. Me myself and my personal account? I'd likely still just sit on 1 full Bitcoin permanently and just start buying up some BCH if I want to rather than ever selling my full Bitcoin *for* BCH.

So, Hell or high water, I'm getting one coin and going to sit on it and see what happens. If anything, it gives me the peace of mind to not keep regretting past decisions, and in the future it may teach me a hard lesson about making decisions emotionally.

End of the day though, the regret every time the price spiked was killing me. I can't live every successive year going ""Man if only I bought in and sat on it THIS time"", y'know?

Like I said, diversification is something I'm learning and BCH is in my future, but I feel a need for that symbolic one-full coin.

$200 / $4 a coin = 50 coins x $7k USD = $350k USD.

I know about the fallacies and I know the ""What-if's"" on ""Well when would you have sold?"", but.... Damn. ""$200 and sit for 3-5 years"" ran through my mind so many times, but minimum wage living paycheck to paycheck back then... Wasn't an option. Whereas today if I were to buy the rest of my full BTC and it crashes to $1 in the future, it won't kill my life.

"You were looking at the 4-day version of that chart? By clicking the 50-60 band, that makes that band the lowest on the chart. Since the lowest one on the chart's lower edge can't go down further, any stair-stepping movement at the top of that band has to be from that band (if lower-levels were show, ripples from lower levels get propagated upward, giving a false-positive).

You can also run your mouse across the chart to get a tooltip of the actual numbers. The ""50+"" number goes from around 22,000 at 8:23am UTC to  a low of 16,300 at 8:36am (times on the chart are your own local time, so you'd need to adjust accordingly.

The top edge of that chart hasn't dipped down into the 50 sat/byte band in the last 4 days; is that what you meant? If so, yes, you're misreading what that means. The top-most edge of that chart dipping into a given band's level means that there's no (or very very little) transactions in the mempool that have a higher fee than that level. Whatever the current top-most edge seems to be ""eating away at"" at a given time is about the maximum amount of fee you'd need to pay to get into a block relatively quickly (right now it's the gray-ish 60-80 sat/byte band).

"Ofcourse BTC have to recover, if BTC drops anywhere near $5000 again the entire BTC structure will be evaporated by BCH, the new BCH DAA is deadly.

And that's the beauty of it, the cartel who have a stranglehold on BTC now understands BCH is a real threat that can evaporate their investment overnight, that constant fear will ensure that they have to keep BTC price high at all times.

It's a very costly operation, so they've asked friends in Wall Street to help pump BTC above $7000, but that'll just make it even more profitable for people, especially whales, to sell BTC for BCH.

BTC has a natural weakness: It's unusable, the mempool is constantly clogged.

The BTC foundation is slowly being eaten away but it'll be covered up by price, as BCH gains popularity, bankers have to pay more and more to sustain BTC price, until one day things suddenly flip and BTC enter a free fall.

Then we have the fact that individual bankers are also secretly investing BCH, so when push comes to shove, the bankers will secretly flip for profit too.

So any forked should be considered Bitcoin as long as this applied.

"That was exactly the point.

It's going to take a while for BTC whales to move all their BTC into BCH without jacking up the BCH price to above $10000.

So we make sure Blockstream Core understand that if BTC price falls below $5000, BTC can flip within hours.

Their handlers who understand prices but don't understand the tech, would read about it and then panic, and tell their minions to keep BTC price above $6600 at all costs, they'll also increase their smearing on BCH to help keep the BCH price low.

Yes, and the bankers can't let that happen. Once BTC and BCH prices are close, one nicely timed massive flood to the BTC mempool, will create a snowball exit effect on the next BTC price drop.

If BTC mempool is clogged again and BCH price is close, and you'll have to wait 72 hours to cash out BTC again, the Bithumb lesson will remind BTC traders to at least begin unloading some or all of their BTC, which would still create a snowball effect as long as the mempool flood is effective enough.

One failed cash out leads to panic, which leads to another failed cash out, and then another panic.

Golden :-)

But that is actually the biggest advantages with a free software project, if one doesn't like the direction the software maintainers is going, one can fork it and own it.

The Bitcoin Core github repo is controlled by some 3-4 maintainers, those have the ultimate veto power and can block anything they want - and it was [already predicted two years ago](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830) that we will never get a block size increase as long as the current maintainers are in charge.

Now, Bitcoin Core is more than a software, it's also the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol - and protocols are a quite different beast than software.  The network effect is very strong, it's always hard to challenge the incumbent.

In general, it's [a bad idea to create yet another standard](https://xkcd.com/927/), from that perspective I was a bit against the Bitcoin Cash project at it's inception (what's wrong with ethereum, dash, zcash, monero, etc?).  Ideally we should have *one* strong crypto currency usable for ordinary payments - and since Bitcoin is unusable for ordinary payments, it can't be Bitcoin.  With hundreds of different alts to chose between, we have no chance challenging the established payments systems.

I actually think I would have been much more comfortable if some newer, more modern crypto-currency would have dethroned the Segwit1X-Bitcoin - but Bitcoin Cash seems to be the most viable alternative at the moment, so I support Bitcoin Cash.";20;2;False;tobixen;dpvc105;BAM! $7150;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d3n5z/bam_7150/

A wise trader could do very well for himself if he had access to an unfiltered source of facts on which to trade against the misinformed masses.

One merely needs to understand the underlying fucked up echo chamber culture of BTC and really that's all you need to know to make an informed bet against the long term prospects of that platform.

Because it sheds light on the fact that BTC is actually a bubble. Think about it. The coin itself sucks ass, any other coin would be a better choice for now. The only reason why its kept is that so many people are building infrastructure around it.

They are propping up an inferior coin. So if we go down this ""coin war"" then BTC wont hold up against BCH or Dash Or LTC.

The main functionality of BTC is that its a bubble. That's not a ""use case"" its a big problem if people start trying to pop it. At the same time, if we leave the bubble alone. It will be worth around 10k in a few months.

Yeah I get it. It's for the rich/bankers. Everyone will be credited their low amount of bitcoin on layer 2/3 and they won't care. It really will be gold 2.0 until it's fractional reserve bitcoin going on then people will buy cash, eth, etc to hedge. For people who want to audit the layer 2/3 corps like you and me, we will already have our money in something else. At least we have the freedom to choose now. ;1;1;False;cartridgez;dpue19w;I can currently run a BCH node on my Raspberry Pi.

"There is no point in using a crypto asset as a utility (actually spending it) until it reaches maturity. It's quite silly to do so, actually. 

For instance, if you bought a Television in 2013 with BTC for around $2000, that would be 153 BTC @ $13/BTC that you sent away. Today, that $2000 investment/those 153 BTCs are now worth  $1,050,192 at current price of $6864/BTC. so you lost over $1 million in unrealized gains in a four year span by sending away a currency before it had matured.

The same can be said for any constantly rising asset. If you went to a bar and bought $40 worth of alcohol for about 0.12 BCH @ $330/BCH, it's like you really spent $156 for a few rounds of drinks in unrealized gains as it now sits around ~$1300/BCH.

The utility aspect won't come for a long time, after all, less than 1% if the global population is actively participating in the crypto scene, much less are even aware it exists. 

Currencies are required to be stable in order to incentivize people to actually use them as such. Otherwise they will just spend fiat, as the price of the USD FRN doesn't have radical volatility. In economics, this is called Gresham's Law--'good' money exits the economy and the 'bad' money is what circulates (fiat sovereign currencies).

This is why Litecoin's stability in price is actually a good thing if it's to be used as a currency for day-to-day expenses like Charlie sateted on CNBC.

It will reach a tipping point, but the crypto market needs to capture trillions before this ever happens. That's why you HODL for now.

"It's much much easier for one person to run 1000 nodes than 1000* 1 node per person. Different/dynamic IPs are not any problem.

There is no economic incentive for the average joe to run full nodes, **because** non-mining nodes contribute nothing to Bitcoin network. It would be a bug if the network provides the reward for trash activities.

If I could afford 1000 different IP addresses and the associated hardware to have one full node on each of those IPs, I would.

There is also something I forgot to mention at the start of the conversation. Another thing where having non-mining full nodes helps, is with the trustworthiness of zero-confs; by having a large number of hops between user and miner who do not benefit from replacing transactions with higher fee ones, it makes it much harder for double-spends to reach miners.";1;0;False;TiagoTiagoT;dpvnwcm;I can currently run a BCH node on my Raspberry Pi.

"The economic majority is still there with Core's BTC, that much is obvious, but some of us know that reality always lags a bit, and it takes time for the masses to realise what the reality is, and then the economic majority will follow.

Fact is pretty much everyone (with some rare exceptions) is in crypto as investment. But as soon as utility comes into this world and businesses start accepting it in masses, people will want to use their coins, and those that turn out to not be usable... will be rejected and people will switch to what is usable.

"Look at your tone. GG dude. You cannot assess anything in an objective manner. It's measly compared to the return that was generated simply by not spending it and holding onto it as it matured! That's objectively obvious. Exactly, the cost grows exponentially higher as time progresses that's why it's best to try to obtain a single coin now. And even better in the past and that is the very reason why people that had been lucky enough to obtain one or more should be holding.

You have an inability to hear or understand what people are saying to you and I suppose just insist on forcing your view onto people. I'm about to drop a voice memo on you as a response if you respond with something absurd again.

And Wtf is your problem? I'm not talking shit. Just because you disagree with me? Wtf. I'm stating objective facts about the historic price movements and suggesting it's wise to hold onto the asset based on those price movements.

As I said, **if you want to spend a currency before it has matured** go ahead and operate that way. That's your choice.
