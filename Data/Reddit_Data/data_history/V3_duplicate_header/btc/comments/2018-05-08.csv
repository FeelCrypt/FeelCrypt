"ELI5\- 

1\) The whitepaper assumed that Bitcoin might scale with SPV nodes\(light clients that don't validate all the consensus rules\) with something called Fraud alerts or fraud proofs . These have never existed and may never properly exist , thus reinforcing the importance of validating your own txs with a full node as trusting a third part is not using p2p cash by definition and is less secure 

2\)  Many Bcash supporters care less about security , de\-emphasize the importance of full nodes , and promote the idea that we should just trust the miners to do the right thing instead of having economic users validate the txs and keep the miners in check. 

3\) The article I linked makes the assumption that Bitcoin or Bcash scaling in a far more centralized and less secure way as a hypothetical and does the math to see if it could scale with almost all users using light clients 

4\) The math shows it cannot scale with this assumption due to the demand on the servers serving SPV clients

"Not used very widely.

BTC is already bottlenecked and LN is still far away from being ready for game time. To bet on BTC/LN is like saying: ""Let's wait a few years, then maybe we'll race for users and merchants"". If you want that bet, then you should avoid publicity because uptake causes congestion causes heartburn for all involved.

BCH is certainly on a race for mindshare, the difference is that they can absorb the uptake in merchants and users, it's ready for the uptake now instead of 2020

Segwit2X failure was the proof everyone needed that Bitcoin has been taken over....everyone had agreed on that fork, what a governance gongshow.

How exactly will LN improve security, or quicker confirmations or true p2p cash? It is a complex topic, and everyone everywhere (except geeks) will end up setting up a single channel with Amazon with all of their bitcoins in the channel. It is so blindly obvious that that will happen. 

So my wife will run her own watchtower? And somehow we need to explain this to people?

"> Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mb. 

What?

The upgrade is to 32MB block LIMIT. It's not that the blocks will be 32MB in size right after upgrade. You really need to understand why the LIMIT is there in the first place. 

Clue - it is not to limit the tx capacity.

This upgrade is to show the users the path BCH is going  - on-chain scalling.
