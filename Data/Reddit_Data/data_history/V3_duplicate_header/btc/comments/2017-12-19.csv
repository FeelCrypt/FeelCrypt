Ripple was designed by Ryan Fugger in 2004.

"Yes, definitely more centralized and pre-mined, and focused on reducing overall friction in the transfer of value between the financial players. This focus is actually what makes it so valuable. Think about the TRILLIONS of dollars in flow every day, think about the costs of supporting the respective infrastructure, transfer fees, currency conversion fees, etc... now with a blockchain-driven support structure, these fees go dramatically down. Hence the value of something like Ripple. Ripple, so far, is the only Crypto (I have found, please suggest others) that can scale to the volume that the global economy requires; think about how many VISA transactions occur alone - this is actually a MASSIVE point of contention in global/domestic economies that has been too expensive/complex to solve without blockchain. 

VISA charges merchants around 3% per transaction when you swipe your card at their store. Multiply that times all the VISA transactions and you get serious cash. This will help you: https://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-heres-how-much-currency-is-traded-on-average-every-day-2016-9

Banks don't really have incentive to scale it to the level of Visa.  There are already alternatives in use, it's just a way for them to to make money off of blockchain hype with a massive supply of tokens that are only used for shuttling money between themselves.

I do think that Ripple is compelling and effective technology, I just already have money invested in a couple banks, so I feel like I have those fronts covered.

I still dont see how XRP will not increase in value as banks leverage it to minimize their costs when scaling to the level of VISA, for example. As bank transaction fees go down, XRP increases in value - no? 

Not that I have to explain myself to random internet strangers but its important to be accurate - as I mentioned above. So, I seriously am committed to the technology on all the cryptos I'm interested in, and the community as well - IOTA is def my favorite by a long shot but has a long and and windy road ahead of it to help us reach IoT singularity ;)

Fair points, but doesnt the wide spread adoption of one currency by financial institutions increase its value regardless of whether its centralized or not?

Young? Ripple in its current incarnation is the second oldest altcoin in the top 100, after Litecoin. Actually the original Ripple system was invented way before Bitcoin. If it were going to do something it would have done it already. Ripple Labs just bought out the concept and added a token to it to ride the altcoin wave in 2013.

Jon Snow's father is shown in that link as Rhaegar Targaryen, the brother of Daenerys. So they must be nephew/aunt.

This means Jon has a better claim to the iron throne than Daenerys. He is the legitimate son of the (now dead) rightful heir, she is the rightful heir's sister.

I really don’t understand all the hate for Ripple. They are a Blockchain as a service company more so then a “cryptocurrency” as the uneducated masses call it. It’s really hard to look at XRP through the same lens as other players out there as it does not compare. But it is in fact, not centralized...it’s a distributed ledger fuckwits. It does utilize a private node structure but that’s only because of the companies it’s “service” is aimed towards. It’s very feasible to believe that the banking play is there way in. Builds the network and capabilities amongst banks and major industry players. Once it’s been adopted on a large scale, XRP can be fully utilized as a way for consumers to interface with their respective lender/bank/credit card company. It’s the only currency that is being readily and quickly adopted by the enterprise space. It’s pre-mined with a high supply as they want to keep the fluctuations to a minimum as to carter to their customer base which would be major banks. They also have an asset freeze and release schedule to deal with this high potential cap that is easy to understand and well thought out...you can hate XRP all you want, but please read a little about it before erroneously lumping into categories it has no business being in. It’s a long play, highly disruptive and focused on changing the game from the inside. Quite the opposite of something like BTC which goal was to be a banking alternative. ;3;0;False;Sqtrevives;drhgou3;Crypto explained to GoT fans;https://i.redd.it/iwdj7qd77u401.png

"What do you mean not as valuable? I once went all in on Bitcoin Cash literally putting in my Bitcoins I've had since 2013 into Bitcoin Cash believing it was the solution back when it was $550. I profited a LOT because BCH more than doubled, it more than tripled in value, but I lost a lot of sleep on Bitcoin Cash as well because of all the FUD and the freaking transaction times. Sometimes it took me 5 freaking hours to send anything, I don't know if that has improved, but trades were not possible with Bitcoin Cash.

I cashed out to BTC before the CBOE futures. I re-discovered Dogecoin, and I found out there could only be 110,000 Dogecoin MILLIONAIRES (people that have 1 million Dogecoins or more), while there can be 21 million people that hold 1 Bitcoin.

In terms of those numbers, it's more than 100x rarer to find a Dogecoin Millionaire than it is to find a person with 1 Bitcoin.

So becoming a Dogecoin Millionaire is > than holding 1 Bitcoin Cash or even 1 Bitcoin. If you're talking about market cap PRICES, yes Bitcoin Cash is more ""valuable"", but you're now using ""Bitcoin Core's"" argument against me, and plenty of people here will say ""Value doesn't describe use case""";2;1;False;Aeternion;drggqwv;I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups.

Yes, there are a large number of speculators, but there is a growing portion that are actually users. There are increasingly more merchants who accept cryptos.

Also, I’m not saying bitcoin is in a bubble in that way. When it crashes, it will be because the speculators have already pulled out, and the users see that it’s unusable.

At that point, the money will not be pulled out of the market. It will be pulled out of bitcoin and put into better alternatives.

I trust Bitcoin Unlimited a little bit less than Bitcoin ABC because the Bitcoin Unlimited leadership announced a quite extensive collaboration with the scammer Craig Wright and his patent troll company Nchain.

"> Should I skip this warning? After all these years, why didn't Bitcoin.com or Copay get themselves identified as Mac developers with Apple?

If I would've gotten that warning then I would've ignored it in this particular circumstance because Apple has had a history of banning Bitcoin-related apps from their app store. So the reason is probably because it's not worth the time and effort to get approved by Apple because they keep changing their mind about whether to allow Bitcoin-related apps or not allow them. But that's just my guess. I've never used Apple products or services (except for one Apple TV for Netflix and stuff).

> I'm suspicious of hardware wallets, like Ledger, because no one knows for sure if a rogue employee has put in any nefarious code into the firmware. Even the Ledger link says that the firmware is not open source.

Yes I'm suspicious too. I would not trust them with more than about 10 % of my cold storage coins at a time. For maximum trust I'd trust the Bitcoin ABC full node software and wallet specifically. But there's a tradeoff there and that tradeoff is that Bitcoin ABC is only as secure as the rest of that desktop computer is secure. If the OS on the desktop computer gets hacked then it won't matter that Bitcoin ABC has been audited and concluded to be trustworthy. So hardware wallets have their usecase.

> What are your thoughts about Electron Cash?

I did not use it because I personally have little knowledge about its developer and their reputation. But it's been several months now and no one has been complaining about the wallet having stolen any coins. The wallet program is open source too I think so it's probably been audited sporadically by random people. It's a fork of Electrum if I remember correctly so an audit of only the changes shouldn't take too much time and effort.

I trust Roger to never intentionally steal my coins through his ""Bitcoin.com wallet"" app so I personally trust that app the most at the moment for transactions involving smaller to medium amounts. For large amounts I'd probably use a freshly installed and updated Ubuntu LTS OS with Bitcoin ABC running and nothing else installed or running. 

But I'm unnecessarily paranoid about losing coins so much lower security precautions are probably ok too. It's very rare that people complain about losing coins considering that there are probably tens of millions of people in the world that are currently handling quite large sums of money.

> I agree that Craig Wright lacks credibility for what he did. However, the Gigablock Initiative is showing that BCH can scale massively with bigger blocks. Don't you think that is providing value?

Scammers provide value from time to time or no one would ever want to collaborate with them about anything. That doesn't mean that it's a good idea to collaborate with scammers. There are plenty of other people in this world to collaborate with.

> According to nChain's CEO, Jimmy Nguyen, they will provide several patents (royalty-free) to BCH. Why do you think that these will have no value?

Nchain has a huge amount of Bitcoin-related patents. I'm against the patent system as a whole and I'm very suspicious about anyone who has a patent about anything. In this particular case this Nchain company was founded by the known scammer Craig Wright and he said in one of his earlier presentations at a conference that it's his patents and that there's nothing wrong about him trying to profit from them any way he sees fit. I don't expect for a second that Nchain or Craig Wright are going to be using their Bitcoin-related patents ""defensively"" or ""for the benefit of the Bitcoin Cash currency or community"". They're a patent troll company plain and simple. They just haven't started the patent trolling yet.

So in conclusion, the Nchain / Craig Wright patents are of *negative* value so not just ""no value"".";1;1;False;todu;drhe2ke;I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups.

"re: Bits

This makes a bunch of sense.

1 Bit = 100 Satoshi's.

100 million Satoshi's in a Bitcoin(Cash).

1 million Bits in a Bitcoin(Cash).

21 million Bitcoin(Cash's) [when capped in the 22 century sometime]

21 trillion total Bits. (easier then having to explain what a quadrillion is [2.1 quadrillion Satoshi's])

So a Byte would be 800 Satoshi's haha.

-.-

It just makes it easier to talk about/explain quickly.

"I'll give you my answer. I'm sure Roger would mostly agree.

Bitcoin is the original deal. It's likely the biggest thing to happen in the 21st century which will forever change human society. Bitcoin is huge and important. And with such a monumental and valuable change to society, the history and legacy of the Bitcoin blockchain is just as valuable. Bitcoin Cash has all of Bitcoin's original history, up until August 1st, 2017.

Bitcoin is still a new and exciting technology. Not many people know what it is or the basics of how it works. Even fewer people on this earth know all the in-depth technical details of how the technology works (to the degree that they could maintain and modify the source code safely). That is why I believe the protocol must remain simple and true to the original Satoshi white paper. We do not need to segregate signatures from transactions with a soft fork hack. We do not need to ruin Bitcoin's original cash-like properties in order to force Lightning hubs down all our throats. It's way too fucking early for that bullshit. What needed to be done was to scale the blockchain first. Money is Bitcoin's first application. If it can't even do *that* right, then what value does it really have? So that's what Bitcoin Cash does. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin scaled the way it was supposed to be. It's still Satoshi's original invention and not some new-fangled crypto coin.

People say Bitcoin could one day go the way of Friendster or Myspace. But look at the cryptocurrency market. None of the shitcoins ever truly die. There's always some bloke somewhere mining one, and there's always some Joe somewhere buying it from some other Joe somewhere else. Neither Bitcoin Core nor Bitcoin Cash will ever die. I suspect if Core ever enters a difficulty death spiral, an emergency hard fork will be released that either changes the PoW algorithm or the difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Bitcoin's blockchain is a sort of DNA. Sometimes it branches off and evolves, but every version shares that same original genesis block - the greatest common ancestor. The Bitcoin blockchain's history will never die so long as humans (or even machines) value any kind of cryptocurrency (not just Bitcoin). So when I invest in Bitcoin, it's not *just* the technology I'm investing in. It's the name and the history. People invest in gold because of its history. Platinum is a more industrially useful metal but you'll hardly ever see a precious metals person salivate over platinum. Value comes from collective human consciousness. That is why the history and legacy of Bitcoin is so important and carries immense value.

tl;dr: Bitcoin Cash holds more history than any other altcoin, it's the better version of Bitcoin, and it holds true to Satoshi's original brilliant vision.";2;1;False;;drgeejb;I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups.

Nobody comes to Reddit to listen to your abuse or to be part of your bullying those of lesser means.  Can you imagine if Oprah did the same thing.

Libertarian philosophies may have motivated you, but its not how you ""got into bitcoin"".  Nor will the masses use bitcoin because of [libertarianism](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72xxip/satoshi_nakamoto_was_not_libertarian/).

You should read the comments I have written, the articles I blogged about here and there over the years, longer posts I have written about specific things, my Wikipedia contributions and my art work to name a few.  My liberal philosophies is why I got into free speech.  Liberalism has granted me massive freedoms.

>Why would I modify my behavior to try and stop climate change?

Because you, I and every human share the single atmosphere.  Just like there are more people who care about mitigating climate change than who don't, more people want to mitigate libertarianism than those who don't.  Hence laws, taxation, welfare, government.  Your problem is that your monetarist ego inhibits your ability to see the world from other perspectives.  Remember [Satoshi Nakamoto was not libertarian](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72xxip/satoshi_nakamoto_was_not_libertarian/).

I think a [decentralised web](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7g2hxw/bitcoin_cash_will_usher_in_a_decentralised_web/) is more important than discussion about paying taxes.

I don't have to worry about paying off my college loans or my house because I already paid that off, thanks to a bet on bitcoin because of my libertarian philosophies.

It's impossible to create a 100% immutable platform that instills any public confidence. I would not put money in a platform where I can lose everything I put in due to a random bug, which will always happen in software unless formal verification is developed, which many smart people are working on.

"This was amazing. It is a theme/concept I have thought about a lot in my life. It is briefly touched on at the end of the ridiculous movie Lucy. Humans, and probably every living thing, must compartmentalize concepts because it is simply much much more efficient in terms of processing, and communication.

If you take the example of the concept of a cow. When you read the word 'cow', you don't experience the full concept of what a 'cow' really is. You experience a highly simplified version. You will probably experience a rough cow shape with 4 legs, probably white and brown colour, possibly even chewing some grass. Unless something else is specifically described, you are unlikely to conceive of anything more than that. A cow is almost infinitely more complex than that though. It is made up of trillions of cells, each with complex internal mechanisms and external interactions. Then you have the behaviour of the cow and its social interaction, and interaction with the ecosystem. You also have the connection the cow has with all its ancestors and therefore all life itself. 

Clearly we do not have the mental capacity to think about every concept in this depth, so we compartmentalize everything into very basic concepts. The issue comes when people think the simple concept _is_ the thing itself.

Like you say, we see this in all concepts that are used by Core (fork, Bitcoin, altcoin, consensus, fee market, scaling, decentralization, ledger, node, implementation, full blocks). They have compartmentalised these concepts to nothing more than the word itself, sometimes not even that. Some of these concepts have been reduced down to just a feeling that you're supposed to feel (altcoin, decentralisation, consensus). You see them constantly say that they must fight for decentralisation. Then you ask them for a definition of 'decentralisation' & some way to measure it and they cannot provide one.

The key to understanding complex concepts is temporarily expanding the compartments you create for concepts as required. Core supporters are constantly having to simplify the concepts they assess to make sure a contradictive reality does not seep in. This is how we have ended up at a point where they are saying 'not using bitcoin' = 'using bitcoin'.

"Not any more than pooled mining.  Sure, a node with more resources will be more connected, but the difference here is that anyone can open a node and add utility to the network.  When routing, the larger nodes will be routing more transactions (which may appear centralized) but the reality is that if the network can be made connected enough (again, anyone can create a node - and it is incentivized with low fees), then there are ways to avoid ""central"" nodes which may attempt to exploit fees from users.  So actually, it appears there is a built-in counter-centralization incentive.  It's a balance between utility and user needs.

"The act of opening a payment channel between two parties is really them deciding to create a pot that only they control. Off-chain, before broadcasting the ""open a payment channel"" transaction, they decide how much each party will put in the pot of their own money. The pot then starts out labeled with how much each party out in it. The ""open a payment channel"" transaction includes signatures from both parties, so both parties ""make"" the payment channel.

You don't have to keep a payment channel open longer than you want to; part of the 'trustless' nature of the channels is that either party can close the channel and walk away at any time, without needing the other party's consent/cooperation. So you as the merchant could say you'll keep it open for 10 days in case of a refund need, but if the zombie apocalypse comes tomorrow and you want to pack up shop, you can close the channel early, get your funds out, and deal with the PR consequences later.

"On [this page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets), you can find a list of markets that offer BCH trading pairs. This doesn't necessarily mean they will sell you BCH for fiat though. Some exchanges are crypto only and don't accept fiat, some exchanges only sell BTC for fiat. Idk which to recommend cuz Idk which sells BCH for fiat, but what I would suggest is you buy BTC and then trade it for BCH.

To buy BTC, you can use most exchanges, Coinbase seems to be very popular. I've heard bad things about Kraken here on this sub so avoid that. I use QuadrigaCX cuz I'm Canadian and they are local to me. You can also buy Bitcoin from an ATM, though they usually charge high fees in my experience - high compared to exchanges. You can try localbitcoins.com to meet people in person, it's kind of like a Craigslist for Bitcoin I guess. Speaking of Craigslist, Bitcoin is popular enough that people sell it there too, but I would recommend the first two options over meeting someone (exchanges and ATMs).

Finally, when you have your Bitcoin, you can easily use changelly.com or shapeshift.io to quickly and conveniently trade different cryptos with each other. I would suggest you go to both websites, see how much they would give you for your bitcoin, and go with the one that charges the cheaper rate. Changelly requires you make an account and login but you don't have to be verified or anything so it's very quick. On the other hand, if you bought your BTC from an exchange, you can likely just trade it right on the exchange for BCH (if they offer a BTC/BCH trading pair).

"Once a channel is exhausted in one direction it can only be 'topped up' by shifting the balance in the **opposite** direction. You may be able to negotiate with your counter-party to pay them off-chain to rebalance in your favor, but that comes with some cost, monetary or in terms of trust.

If you're spending less than you're earning, you will always be pushing your channels closer to exhaustion.

If you're moving funds from cold storage to an exchange, you don't _have_ to pay $100 (what wallet are you using that's forcing you to do that?). Depending on how spread out your inputs are, your wallet may be giving you $100 as a suggested fee to get the transaction processed within a few hours. Paying quarter that fee or less would still be a valid transaction, and would clear whenever the mempool dipped enough to touch your fee level (remember, the mempool doesn't have to be ""empty"" for your transaction to go through, it only has to have few transactions with fees higher than yours for yours to be likely to be processed). 

If your fee is too low, your transaction would be eventually dropped and you could try again, which is no different from what you're currently doing (sitting and waiting for a mempool dip), but if you make a low-fee transaction now, and let it sit, it will get processed for you automatically, without you needing to catch the network at the right time.";4;1;False;MidnightLightning;drgw766;If you think consumers are going to throw away $100’s (and soon $1000’s) on transaction fees to open up a payment channel on the Lightning network, you are delusional.;https://twitter.com/olivierjanss/status/942884335912411137

"Ok.. why are you so obsessed with what other random people say? Focus on technical aspects and facts and not meaningless ramblings.

To give you some facts: Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin. Satoshi said about a blocksize increase that it can be 'phased in later'. Satoshi described Bitcoin as 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system'. Satoshi did NOT plan to implement segwit. Satoshi did NOT plan to implement the lightning network. Satoshi did NOT plan to have Bitcoin limited in a way that makes transactions prohibitively expensive.

Bitcoin Core has been hijacked. Public communication channels are censored by notorious anonymous censor 'theymos'. Core developers work for the company Blockstream that will profit off of the lightning network and other products based on driving usage away from the Bitcoin Core main chain.

Now you know, Bitcoin Cash is the original Bitcoin. ";1;1;False;;drhmdn9;Okay, so I've been on /r/ bitcoin for a while now and didn't know this subreddit existed.

"Yes, you can make two one-way payment channels, but then I don't think you will be able to make an unlimited number of transactions.  So, for example, if two channels are established, one from Alice to Bob and the other from Bob to Alice, say each in the amount of 1 BTC, then after Alice has sent 1 BTC to Bob her channel is done, ditto with Bob.  Whereas with a two way channel after each has moved the same amount of funds the single channel would be back to where it started.  Now maybe there is a way around that, but if so, it wasn't obvious to me.

"I went through the 5 most recent users banned just now.  1 was a spammer, one was already suspended permanently by reddit, one was a brand new account promoting superbitcoin, /u/theblockchainman was consistently an asshole in his history, and the last one had only one ""contribution"" stating ""bcash"" in Roger's AMA(and nothing else), but also had a nice history of calling people cunts.

Seems to me that they're doing a good job of banning the people who need to be banned, without preventing dissenting viewpoints from being raised.

I'm not going to dig through the bans to prove your point for you.  You find me a recent ban(last ~5 days) that is clearly inappropriate or biased and we can talk.  But I know from personal experience that the mods of /r/btc are very anti-censorship, so I really doubt you will find anything.  Even roger in his AMA said he won't even block people on twitter unless they don't appear to be a real person, regardless of what they say about him.

"The guy below me has a funny way of saying the complete opposite. You came in here ASKING for someone else to do the thinking for you. You ASKED to be told what to think. I think this is one of the biggest problems Reddit and the micro society it created faces. Regarding the matter at hand I will tell you that, as usual, the truth rests in the middle. Both sides are shit, unfortunately. And if you DYOR you’ll find it out for yourself. Ver is a conman and an absolute cunt. 

Bch scalability fix is legit imo, but it’s not sustainable in the long run. Both off chain and on chain scaling need to happen, no matter how much either side tells you that only their opinion is the right one. The problem with bch is that it’s one of the most centralized coins out there. 

Don’t make the mistake of assuming that Ver is behind bch because he believes in some grand ideal. Only the money. He’s a smart guy, I’ll give him that. Smart enough to try and establish himself as the crypto king by basically hijacking a coin alongside Jihan (who controls around 70% of the hashpower on the bch network - might be a little off on the number, that was the last time I looked into it).  

I’m not gonna go into detail about why the core side is also shit, but if you want I can give you a rundown. If you look through my posting history you’ll see I’m not their dog. I’m banned on their sub also. The only thing I’d appreciate in this sub is that you don’t get banned. You do get downvotted into oblivion, but I guess it’s normal when you attack a person’s beliefs.

"Yeah but if we're going by how people are ""supposed"" to vote, then they shouldn't be downvoting anything btc related solely because it's btc.  This is a bitcoin sub but if you say anything remotely in favor of supporting btc you get downvoted.  Regardless of the legion of people that love to say that doesn't happen.

This sub's front page is constantly dominated by articles praising /r/btc and shit-talking /r/bitcoin.  The only difference is that this sub has less shitpost memes voted to the top.  The only time an article mentioning btc is upvoted to the top here it's because it's being compared to bch or showing that bch is doing something better than btc.  I'm not saying one is better than the other.

Both subs have obvious biases.  Only difference being that your comments and posts won't be removed in /r/btc for supporting something that is generally not agreed with.  It will just be blindly downvoted so much that no one will  see it anyway.

"> Well the bidirectional channels are going to wander off one end or the other often too

Not necessarily, bidirectional channels can be deliberately rebalanced when they are part of a wider network, either manually (for example, routing a top-up from an exchange through the overpaid end of the payment channel), or rebalancing automatically with a smart routing algorithm where someone else's payment takes a detour one or more times through your channel to rebalance it - probably you would pay them a fee for that. Or the channel stops acting as a route in one direction.

However, I don't count on smart automatic routing through non-trivial networks - that's one of LNs unsolved problems, but at least with bidirectional channels the ability to stay balanced is available.";2;1;False;iwannabeacypherpunk;drgisbx;Okay, so I've been on /r/ bitcoin for a while now and didn't know this subreddit existed.

"BIP 0146 may have fixed third party malleability.  However, the funding transaction of a bi-directional LN channel involves two signatures.  As I understand it, from reading the LN white paper, this means that one of the two signatories funding the LN channel could change his **own** signature, so that the resulting funding transaction would have an altered TXID.  This would mean that the pre-signed transactions that were negotiated by the two parties to the channel prior to funding would be null and void.  Consequently, if one of the two parties were uncooperative or hostile he could lock up the funds the other put in, even going as far as creating a possible blackmail situation.

As far as I can tell, to make the Rube Goldberg two way LN payment channels work it requires additional changes beyond BIP 0146.  I believe I know how this can be done, but I'm not sufficiently embedded in the details of Bitcoin scripts, sigops and LN to be certain.

"Yeah and another myth is that Bitcoin Cash supporters (like myself) are radically against anything off-chain. Some are and some are not, and most likely it all depends on context. It never was about that anyways it simply was about ""Hey guys blocks are getting full, let's raise the limit cause that was the original plan, before it stops working like we want it too."" 

That was blocked (there was an attempt) because it got in the way of somebody business model (well at least that is the story most people believe, I believe a power is trying to sabotage or slow down crypto and people are the weakest link, I don't believe theymos is the same theymos from the beginning).

So now with Bitcoin Cash at least there is a working version of Bitcoin again.  Eventually it's blocks will get full too, raising blocksize forever won't work but we don't have to stress out about it right now. 

See the 1 mb blocksize limit debate in my eyes was a very sneaky way of trying to slow down Bitcoin, long long long before it even reaches significant user adoption. 

So for the future we are definitely going to need better politics. Because what if some power infiltrates again, maybe this time the Bitcoin Cash developer community and tries it again in another way? 

Anyway that is kind of what I suspect, don't have to much evidence of it though. To me mathematics and code are harder to attack then people. And so if somebody tries to delay or sabotage crypto it makes most sense to go for the people. I think that is what has happened and might happen again in the future.

"As much as I disagree with the censorship in the other sub, I don't think this place is much better either when it comes to echo chambers and cults.

I absolutely agree BCH is a better digital currency than BTC right now.

I think OSS shows it's strength when people who disagree with the decisions of the development team can fork their own project to maintain.

What I think is stupid is the petty drama over the name of the project. Instead of discussing and celebrating what people feel is the superior coin (BCH), they put all their time and effort into fight over who is the ""real Bitcoin"", even intentionally misleading people and making sure everyone will confuse the two. `/r/btc` and `bitcoin.com` being about `BCH` is stupid.

BCH is growing great and works as P2P payment method.

But instead of focusing on that and the efforts to further advance *a* great cryptocurrency, it's 95% about ""WE ARE REAL BITCOIN! CORE SUCKS!""

An offline IOU is also a contract that can be enforced.

The LN IOUs just sounds like a better IOU: a promise to pay that can be enforced in a easier, faster and cheaper way than going to court to enforce the offchain offline IOUs we have now in the economy.

"> able to transact without third parties, on a decentralized, distributed, immutable ledger

That is not true any more.  

The bitcoin protocol replaces the trusted central authority with a network of miners.  These were expected to be thousands of independent anonymous people, with at least half of them interested only in maximizing their revenue. That assumption was essential to justify Satoshi claim that the system was ""decentralized"" and would work as intended.   

In particular, since (in his assumption) each miner controlled only a small fraction of the hashpower, and could not conspire with other miners, his optimal strategy was to carefully validate all blocks and transactions, and mine on top of the valid branch that had the most apparent work.   If a majority of the miners (counted by hashpower) behaved in this way, then the network would be self-sustaining, self-correcting, and immune to any malicious minority of miners. 

However, today 70% of the mining power is in the hands of six Chinese pools.  They are not anonymous, not independent, and  we have seen them sit together, several times, to decide on changes to the protocol motivated by long-range plans and political considerations.  

Recall, for example, when Peter Todd convinced F2Pool (who then had 15-20% of the hashpower) to implement ""full unsafe"" RBF, before the pool understood the implications of it?  Or the DDoS attacks against pools that were too slow to approve SegWit?

Bitcoin now is more centralized than then international banking system.  Even Visa is more decentralized: it is not a monolithic company, but only an intermediary between the banks that issue credit cards and the banks that pay the merchants, tied to them by exacting contracts; so it cannot quite do what it wants.  

> You cannot refute years of development

There have been many changes to the code and the protocol, but the network has not become significantly better for users (even if one ignores BTC and looks only at BCH.  Since Gavin and Mike have been thrown out of the window, bitcoin has had no competent software developers.  It has been in the hands of amateur hackers, who think they are great developers because they can invent clever hacks like SegWit -- with no regard for their technical burden, risks, and (lack of) utility for users.

> and the community behind it

The community consists almost entirely of three classes of people:  ""drug buyers"", ""bitcoin investors"", and ""operators"".  

The drug buyers (and other people who use bitcoin for illegal payments) do not give a damn about centralization.  They use bitcoin, in spite of its clunkiness and the absurd fees and delays, only because the miners are not (yet) subject to KYC/AML, and thus bitcoin is the only ""international bank"" that they can use.

The ""bitcoin investors"" (that includes hodlers and day-traders) generally do not really care about usability or decentralization either.  They only care about the price going up (hodlers) or trashing about like crazy (day-traders).  They keep hodling and trading bitcoin because they are basically gambling addicts, and do not mind the odds being against them and the expected gain being strongly negative, as long as the promised prizes are large enough.  

And the ""operators"" (which include miners, mining rig makers, exchange and fund operators, BATM makers and operators, bitcoin entrepreneurs, and all sort of scammers and swindlers) do not care for usability or decentralization either, because they know that the ""bitcoin investors"" are dumb and they will believe any stories that promise to make them rich, like ""Visa-level adoption with the LN"", ""digital gold"", ""world's reserve currency"", etc..  They continue to run and promote bitcoin because they are pocketing at least 50 million USD every day from the stupid ""bitcoin investors"" and stupid VC investors.";1;0;False;jstolfi;drgx5l5;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.
