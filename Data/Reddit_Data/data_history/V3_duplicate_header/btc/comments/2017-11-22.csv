Yup. On the other hand, if it was not a picture of Greg Maxwells signature neckbeard, and posted shortly after I requested it, I'd take that as evidence toward it not being Greg. I doubt highly that Greg would be capable of asking someone else to agree to pose for such a ridiculous picture on such short notice.

"Hey, thanks for doing this--almost all your postulations about me are correct. I'll just add a couple things:

> 4n4n4 seems to have a deep knowledge of Bitcoin on a technical level

Ha! I wish. I do try to follow and understand development to the best of my ability, but it's very much not my area of expertise so I'm always in over my head with the really technical stuff. From time to time I'll do a little code-digging to look for simple stuff that I can understand (for example, like how [MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is no longer part of the Bitcoin consensus rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/consensus/consensus.h)), but largely I can only try to analyze and explain ideas, rather than actual code.

> Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.

A bit of trivia: To my recollection, one of my comments explicitly linking to a UASF build was one of if not the only comment I've had moderated in rbitcoin. I didn't fight it because it's not incorrect to say that BIP148 significantly diverged from Bitcoin's consensus rules (though ended up staying fully compatible), but since it was removed, maybe my support isn't as obvious in my posting history. At that point I also started chilling in the #uasf dragon's den super top secret slack channel, so most of my UASF-talk moved elsewhere. The whole truth of the matter is I agreed with nullc about BIP149 being a much safer deployment mechanism (and I still do and look forward to BIP8's use in future deployments), but with the steam that was gathering behind BIP148 I made the decision to run with it and take the risk, which he did not.";1;1;False;4n4n4;dq7kvy8;"Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

"
>Seems to know an awful lot about nullc's life.

I know both of those things, too. So do you. Neither of us are Gregory Maxwell, and *once again* this is explained by the fact that 4n4n4 obviously follows the space closely.

These things are not secret. I suspect that the facts mentioned in both of these links are already well known by *most people posting in this thread*.

>Used the phrase ""Bitcoin's creator"", a major nullc trait previously documented

Please *actually look at the context he used that phrase in*. Saying ""Satoshi"" in that sentence *would not work*. It would have read: ""lmfao are you serious? Satoshi is on the other side? ... It's possible he believes that scamtoshi is Satoshi :("" which would have been a *very* awkward phrasing. I myself probably would have said ""It's possible he believes that scamtoshi *actually created Bitcoin*"" but ""is Bitcoin's creator"" feels just as natural there. In any case, saying ""scamtoshi is Satoshi"" when the quote from the comment above itself leaves off on ""Satoshi"" would have been a *lot* of ""xtoshi""s in a row, which most halfway-decent writers would shy from because *it doesn't sound right* due to being *horribly redundant*.

This is a painfully blatant stretch. If he had lots of documented cases of saying ""Bitcoin's creator"" in place of ""Satoshi"" or ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" this might hold *some* water, but in this context, it simply doesn't.

>Talks about nullc. A lot.

By that logic, **everyone on /r/btc is a sockpuppet of nullc's**. Everyone here talks about him *far more* than 4n4n4 seems to.

Furthermore, this is *once again* explained by the fact that 4n4n4 is subscribed to the mailing list (where Maxwell is quite active), and seems to keep up-to-date with developments in the space. Once again, the argument that *I am Gregory Maxwell* has *just as much evidence* as the claim that 4n4n4 is.


>Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream.

**Are you joking?!** The comments you linked to *explicitly quote Gregory Maxwell as a source*. Please, anyone reading this, click the links in question. The first one says: ""**I don't know their profit model** and neither do you. **Greg has denied** that Lightning plays a significant role in their plans--beyond perhaps being very beneficial for Bitcoin in general--and their allocation of, **in his words**, 1.5 people to development of Lightning **doesn't seem to suggest** that it's especially important to them.""

If anything, this comment indicates **strongly** that 4n4n4 *does not have special knowledge of the internals of Blockstream*. The second link reiterates what is said in the first (and contains **no** extra information about Blockstream). 

The fact that you tried to spin these links as ""Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream"" is one of the most disingenuous phrasings of your entire post (and as I've been showing, you have been phrasing things horrendously disingenously throughout). You are clearly *deliberately trying to mislead readers* with how you're presenting these links. Saying he ""somehow knows"" these things clearly implies that it is secret, privileged information, when in fact the comment itself explains that *he is quoting Maxwell directly* which explains *exactly* how he knows what he knows.

>And even responded directly to nullc in support of a claim nullc had made multiple times within that thread

You just linked to a comment corroborating what nullc had said. In fact, it starts with ""Can confirm"" which is a common way for someone on reddit to chime in and say ""Yes, what the person above me is saying is true."" 

This is exactly something you would expect a technically-inclined user to contribute to a thread like that, if they had firsthand experience that confirmed what Maxwell was claiming. This, *yet again*, seems to serve as evidence *against* the hypothesis that this user is controlled by nullc.

Beyond that, [external analytical tools indicate that 4n4n4 is **UNLIKELY** to be a sockpuppet of nullc's](https://83m6a1f16h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/redditsockdetector/dectect/nullc/4n4n4), and *if* it is a sockpuppet, then Maxwell was careful enough to have made comments with both different accounts *within 2 seconds of one another*. This is a theory which requires an *extraordinary* suspension of disbelief to entertain.

Finally, [/u/4n4n4 has explicitly denied this allegation](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq5nijs/), saying: ""I've followed Maxwell's posts on BCT and here since a while before I made this account because I like to learn from people who know their shit."" This is exactly what I have been arguing is the most likely explanation of the similarities you have tried to paint in such a sinister light. Again, by the same token, I can equally well be accused of being a sockpuppet of nullc's, because I, too, like to learn from people who ""know their shit"" (and there are many others like me).

>After the massive amount of research we put into this, we believe that at least one moderator of /r/Bitcoin must have been either aware of the bot's plans (and allowed it to place blame on others), or have executed the attack themselves.

After the massive amount of effort you put into this, at least one moderator of /r/Bitcoin (namely, me) believes that *you were complicit in the attack in question* and that *this post itself is part of it* (and perhaps was the end-game all along). Your conclusion that /r/Bitcoin moderators were somehow involved has been *thoroughly* debunked here, and I believe that I have done an excellent job in demonstrating that you have *no* actual evidence in favor of that hypothesis. You've simply phrased things to *imply* that this is the case, without ever actually providing *any* evidence of it.

>This is most likely the moderator who immediately approved the [CU-1] comment.

You are specifically accusing StopAndDecrypt here. /u/StopAndDecrypt, did you orchestrate (or were you involved with) the vote-brigading mentioned in this post? I do not believe that they were.

>Other moderators may or may not have been involved. Meaning, yes, we believe that a moderator of /r/Bitcoin either directed or was complicit in the hacking of many of their own Bitcoin Reddit user accounts.

This is unbelievably scummy of you, *especially* if you are the actual perpetrator. Shame on you. **Shame on you.**

>We believe that it is likely that /u/4n4n4 aka /u/nullc was also aware of or involved in this attack based upon the suspicious timing and similarities of [CU-2].

There was no ""suspicious timing and similarities"" that I can see. I believe I have done well in demonstrating this, in fact. I will let the diligent readers in the audience decide if they agree with me on this matter.

>Some users reported that the IP addresses the bots logged in from were vultr instances and that vultr 1) requires tracable payment methods like credit cards, and 2) takes an aggressive stance against abuse of their systems, so perhaps more information can come to light about this yet. We encourage the Reddit admins to carefully review our claims and to validate them. If our claims here are true, surely some type of strong action is warranted.

"Alright, I'll take a moment to look this over, if only to separate facts from speculation.

Here we go.

>When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( Image of #1, link to #2 ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating. 

Actually, both /u/4n4n4 and /u/StopAndDecrypt have been approved submitters to /r/Bitcoin for 5 months or more. So no, neither comment needed to be manually approved by the moderators, and in fact, as a moderator of /r/Bitcoin, I can say for a fact that **neither comment was manually approved by a moderator of /r/Bitcoin**. This is a fact. 

So right there, your ""smoking gun"" (and your chief hypothesis) is out the window. Let's continue.

>The bots which were downvoting comments and posts on /r/Bitcoin and upvoting posts on /r/btc began their attack on 11/14/2017 at around 18:00 utc. A similar unusual pattern of voting appeared on /r/btc around the same time the day before, though less dramatically. The bots seemed to be pushing people to buy Bitcoin Cash in such a blatant way that it even left a bad taste in the mouths of Bitcoin Cash supporters. Both the attack the day before and the /r/Bitcoin bot voting attack on 11/14/2017 ended before or around 22:00 utc [REF-3]. The bots attacking /r/Bitcoin upvoted posts complaining about high fees and downvoted about 30 other /r/Bitcoin posts. At the same time they upvoted posts on /r/btc. We identified 65 comments downvoted by bots in /r/Bitcoin and 2 upvoted. The conclusions appeared to indicate that the bots were promoting Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and harming /r/Bitcoin.

This is all true.

>We began investigating into the comments that caught our eye at first, referred to as [CU-1] and [CU-2] for short. [CU-1]'s content can be seen here as it originally looked. Immediately we noticed the next oddity - How were people able to see votes in /r/Bitcoin to discuss voting in the first place? /r/Bitcoin has blocked votes from being visible on comments during discussion for years. When did that change? We found that it changed right before [CU-1] was posted. BashCo stickied a comment stating they would ""pull back the curtains"" at 20:49, and archive.org confirmed that scores became visible between 20:32 utc and 20:50 utc. That, oddly enough, was just 13 minutes before [CU-1] was posted at 21:02:25.

So, to make sure the facts are straight here... the timeline here is that [this post](http://i.imgur.com/xrM39eb.png) was made, it was upvoted massively by a malicious bot army, [BashCo started a thread about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/) to call attention to it (and as you noted, [he temporarily enabled transparent vote-scores to highlight the attack](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptn609/)), and the attack continued from there. Then darwin2500 chimed in *to make fun of BashCo for pointing out the attack*, and was immediately upvoted massively (by the same malicious bot army, it would seem). It was approved by StopAndDecrypt a couple of minutes later (almost certainly because he was replying to the comment, and it was *yet another example of vote manipulation* that served to highlight what was being done and reinforce BashCo's valid points), and later deleted by darwin2500, the original submitter of the comment.

I don't see what you mean by ""oddly enough"", considering the entire episode was about *an ongoing vote manipulation campaign* that BashCo and StopAndDecrypt were calling attention to. In other words, none of the above seems to indicate *any* sort of foul play from *any* moderators of /r/Bitcoin *whatsoever*, but it seems like you are trying to imply that it does.

>We have determined that [CU-1] was indeed blocked by /r/Bitcoin's automoderator rules as we expected. The screenshot taken by /r/Bitcoin moderator StopAndDecrypt clearly shows this, as the ""moderator approved"" checkmark is present. We also tested automoderator rules with an aged account with karma and confirmed that ""censors"" and ""censoring"" were both blocked [REF-1]. Note that the poster, darwin2500 (under control of hacker, please don't ping them; they aren't a Bitcoiner) could not have been an ""approved submitter"" - they seem to have only had one comment in /r/Bitcoin before the hacking.

So you are aware of the ""approved submitter"" possibilities, and failed to even *mention* the possibility that either StopAndDecrypt or 4n4n4 were approved submitters in your very first paragraph when you said: ""Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.""? That in itself is rather telling.

Readers, I urge you to re-read my previous paragraph until you understand the point I am making very clearly. OP is *very* deliberately trying to ""spin a narrative"" here, not mentioning the possibility of certain comments being visible because they were made by approved submitters (which I can tell you for a fact is the truth) and instead pretending like the **only** possible explanation for the comment(s) being visible was that they were manually approved by /r/Bitcoin moderators (they were not), *even though they obviously know about approved submitters on reddit and discuss this later on in their post*.

>So why was the comment manually approved? 

As I said above, /u/StopAndDecrypt *was replying to the comment in question*, and was obviously *trying to highlight the vote manipulation that was going on*. You can't very well reply to a comment that isn't visible, and it is completely obvious why this comment was approved, when you look at the context it was made in and what was going on.

>We are not aware of any other approved or allowed comments that blatantly reference censorship like that in the last several months. 

There are **many**, but admitting this doesn't help the narrative that you are trying to spin. I remembered (off the top of my head) an instance from just a few days ago, and [dug it up for you as an example](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dks5y/cut_the_bullshit/dpyif6k/).

So once again, this is more evidence that you're presenting information *incredibly* disingenuously. Comments that reference the alleged ""censorship"" of /r/Bitcoin are allowed all the time, even on a daily basis, despite the fact that they are off-topic and usually made by troll-armies just to stir up drama and mislead newcomers.

>Except this idea did not hold up. We found 10 similar comments from the same time period which were not approved or were explicitly removed unlike [CU-1]. Some of these were uncannily similar to the original comment. For example this one was submitted 8 minutes after [CU-1] and never approved. Another here supported neither subreddit and was blocked at 21:48 and never approved. This one accused /r/Bitcoin mods of being paid by Blockstream and was manually removed at ~22:35. A fourth was identical to [CU-2] and blocked at 00:12 and never approved. The same account of [CU-1] submitted a second comment 5 minutes after [CU-1] and was blocked and not approved. The other 5 things blocked or removed around the same time were: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The existence or absence of most of these comments around the claimed time can be verified independently of the censorship_notifier, see [REF-2]

What on earth? How does this paragraph *in any way* indicate that ""this idea does not hold up""? 

Your argument in this paragraph seems to be: ""If you allow/approve *one comment* that is discussing 'censorship' in the subreddit (to highlight the vote brigading going on, then *you must also allow every single malicious comment made by every troll in the same thread!*"" 

How does that make any sense? The point of the thread was to point out how obviously vote-brigaded things were being, and how the discussion was being manipulated. Letting one or two example comments demonstrate the point is sane. **Letting the entire thread be overrun by trolls would not be!** 

The argument in this paragraph makes no sense! You say ""this idea did not hold up"" but it holds up perfectly.

"In recent times, this site has been politicised to the extreme, and even subs like /r/cringe which have nothing to do with politics have become havens for left-leaning users and mods to promote their ideology, abandoning the original objectives of those subreddits. Take a look at the top posts of /r/cringe to see this in action. We have also seen many of the default subs bought out by political interest groups like ShareBlue and the result is that an impartial opinion on /r/politics, /r/news or /r/worldnews is now non-existent, they are all just echo-chambers. 

  We have mods that moderate hundreds or thousands of subs. We see people being banned from subreddits they have never visited just because of their participation in another sub. We see mods abuse power to ban users from multiple subreddits for one infraction, or with no infractions in some cases. Often these bans come with no explanation and questioning them leads to simply being muted (why does this option exist?). We see a multitude of censored comments in any thread about a remotely sensitive topic.  

  It is clear that the administrators are happy to let these abuses of power persist and happy to let the site become a hyper-politicised safe-zone for liberals. We've seen the site's algorithms changed to target one specific sub which doesn't go along with the narrative, /r/The_Donald, hiding posts from that sub from the front page even though they were happy to let /r/SandersForPresident take over the front page during the 2016 primaries. We also saw an astonishing action taken by the CEO of reddit, Steve Huffman, where /r/The_Donald's users' comments were personally shadow-edited by Steve himself in an act of petty retaliation for the criticism he received, which says a lot about the type of character he is.  

  Finally, the direction the site has been taking lately is very discouraging, as they aim to become a new Facebook. We are now seeing Facebook-like user profiles and a Facebook-like card-view homepage to go along with the Facebook-like quality of content that reddit has sank to, and it looks like the mission to turn reddit into another social media site is well underway, making this a great time to leave.  

  As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this annoying message. I've had some gilded comments, made some funny jokes, given some good advice and started pointless arguments, but now they will all be turned into this, as I delete my profile and take back every comment.

A normal person would not be confident enough to liken a doubling of bandwidth to driving twice as fast, because he would rightly fear ridicule since bandwidth has doubled many times and will continue to double, while maximum safe driving speeds have not doubled in the same way.

Only a supremely confident arrogant person like Greg would think that he can make an argument like that and be safe from ridicule. Greg, you see, has an inflated idea of his own intelligence and thinks everybody else is stupid. So he makes stupid arguments like this with ease while oozing arrogance, thinking everybody will be too stupid to see how ridiculous he is.

Anyway, if there is no reason for 4n4n4 to be granted approved submitter status then that is just as suspicious and incriminatory as manually approving the offending comment.

"So the argument is that moderators approved a comment and then it started being attacked by downvotes, and therefore the mods must be behind those downvotes?

Could it be that the mods knew the pattern of the bot from experience, so picking the correct comment was trivial?

For example if your subreddit gets vote manupilated every day you start to understand what type of comments it happens to. Then you configure auto moderator to remove these comments and require manual approval. But then to show the manipulation you can just approve one, and voila the bots get to work.

So its sort of like having a lake full of piranhas, you know they are there but dont see them until you throw some meat into and it becomes a huge frenzy.

">The comments and posts chosen for downvoting were all over the place. Many of the comments chosen for downvoting seems to have been simply ""because they were there in the thread"" - For example every single comment visible in before 20:50 was downvoted. BashCo was targeted more than any other user(8 comments), but the bot generally didn't seem to focus on specific users. The vast majority of comments downvoted(54/65) happened in the stickied post, with 6 more happening in the second upvoted post. The remaining 5 comments downvoted were scattered across 4 different posts [REF-3]. The bot specifically went after comments and posts talking about downvotes, the accounts hack, or the attack itself [REF-5] but they also downvoted neutral posts. The voting seemed to come almost exclusively in waves targeting one thing at a time, which made the bot votes obvious to anyone who was looking for them - which people were, since many posts targeted were about the downvotes.

This further strengthens my above hypothesis (that this was a blatant attack from entities **antagonistic to /r/Bitcoin**, rather than an elaborate false-flag orchestrated by /r/Bitcoin moderators). The attacker(s) may have been trying to collapse as many comments as possible, to further muddy the waters and make the conversation difficult for readers to digest. After all, their attack was being exposed rather clearly at the time. 

>We also noticed that an extremely high number of /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users were reporting that they themselves were hacked and part of the bot attack. We identified 35 such users, but the highest number of votes seen on a single thing indicate between 250-300 accounts involved with the attack. Over 10% of the hacked users were Bitcoiners, what are the chances of that? Well, Reddit has (very) roughly 50 million accounts, and the CN database indicates that about ~50k are regular or semi-regular /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users, which is 1/1000th. 35 / 300 of hacked users being regular Bitcoin users and feeling the need to post about it is > 1/10th. Whoever was running this bot seems to have intentionally chosen Bitcoin users - It seems like they wanted the hacked users to see the results of the hack.

Wait, what? That is a *non sequitur* (it does not follow). It seems much more likely that the attacker(s) wanted hacked users to be recognizable usernames in the venue-of-attack. Occam's Razor favors this explanation *heavily*, in fact.

And *even* if we go with your explanation, it once again seems like it might implicate *you* in this entire episode, more than anyone else. After all, look at how much work you've gone through here. Your entire account is dedicated to smearing /r/Bitcoin and its moderators (and in fact, you seem to go through *extraordinary* amounts of effort to do so); if **anyone** ""wanted the hacked users to see the results of the hack"" then you (and whoever else collaborates with you on this account and project) are prime suspect number one.

>The result of all of this was that many many people commented on the blatantness of the voting, with many of them suspicious as to why anyone would do such a blatant attack. More examples: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Amidst all of this there was one exception so subtle that we almost missed it - There were two posts voted on that ran completely contrary to the rest of the behavior of the bot. The first image showed upvotes on a pro-/r/Bitcoin post ""PSA: Attack on Bitcoin"" thread and a downvote for the anti-/r/Bitcoin ""awkward meme orgy"" /r/btc thread. At first we thought maybe this was a legitimate vote by this user mixed in with bot votes, but archive.org showed us that indeed that /r/btc thread got a sudden wave of downvotes in less than 23 minutes. Perhaps the bot forgot which side it was pushing for? But both changes were subtle and not noticed by any users as far as we can tell.

I am not quite sure what the accusation here is supposed to be (most likely this entire section is just supposed to be one big nebulous sinister-sounding implication), but I do have a question: how was archive.org being updated so frequently on these (relatively mundane) threads? Someone must have been submitting these pages for archival. Was it you? If not, do you know anything about it?

>The final thing the bot did as far as we have identified was to upvote [CU-2], and then the attack seems to have stopped suddenly. That comment wasn't upvoted until 21:55 - 22:05. So what about that comment? Why was that the only comment not under its own control upvoted, and why did the attack stop suddenly afterwards?

I have explained this above. It seems like the attacker(s) realized that they had been caught red-handed, and tried to ""change gears"" and obscure the attack. Again, this seems to incriminate /r/btc (and you yourself), and I fail to see *any* way that this incriminates any moderators (or supporters) of /r/Bitcoin. You have offered *no* explanation or rationale for this behavior (though, note that I *have*).


>The CN database gave us some hints. Both the [CU-2] and this comment were deleted by the user, likely when they took back control over their hacked account. [CU-1] was deleted at 21:23 +/- 1 minute, ~21 minutes after creation [REF-6], and not present in that snapshot. The votebot operator probably didn't expect this to happen so quickly. After that deletion there was no obvious comment showing their upvotes on the thread

At the time of the linked screenshot, there were no comments in the thread that fit with the narrative that the attacker was trying to support (most that would have fit the bill were likely caught in a filter). Note that there were **many** comments aggressively downvoted at the time, which perfectly demonstrated the ongoing attack (see Stallzy's -242 comment-score, for instance).

>It seems that they wanted a comment that wouldn't vanish, so not a hacked account, and also that they preferred a comment that could ultimately be used to make /r/btc look guilty.

What? That's quite the inductive leap you took there!

Again, Occam's Razor indicates that there were no massively-upvoted comments in the thread (other than the deleted one) because *no comments that fit the attacker's narrative were visible to be targeted at the time*. It wasn't until an approved submitter *tricked* the attacker when we got more evidence of *upvote* manipulation (though, it's important to note that there was *plenty* of extant evidence of *downvote* manipulation still visible in the thread at the time).

>4n4n4's comment [CU-2] provided exactly this, and it was posted to the thread ~5 minutes after [CU-1] was deleted - at 21:28. [CU-2] was never blocked by automoderator, it was picked up in the next CN scan ~1 minute later... Seemingly because 4n4n4 is an approved submitter.

Ah, so you *do* know that this is an approved submitter of /r/Bitcoin. And yet, **in your first paragraph you make no mention of this when you say: 'Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.'**

>But the why wasn't the only oddity. [CU-1] was submitted, approved, upvoted, and screenshotted all in less than 180 seconds, as shown by its screenshot (""2 minutes"" rounds down on Reddit). That is an extremely short time for an automoderated comment to be approved based on what we have observed and in checking other subreddits open modlogs on approvals. Perhaps the moderators were very snappy about approving comments within this particular thread? Once again, this idea did not hold up. This comment appears to have been manually approved as it wasn't seen until the third scan after its supposed creation, ~11 minutes of delay. Perhaps only when the comment was a direct reply to BashCo? Still no - Here's a comment that was a direct reply to BashCo, but didn't show up in scans for 45 minutes. Here specifically the our data can be independently checked - This snapshot does not show the comment, but this one does.

This is *the exact same argument as above*, and makes just as much sense (namely, none). The comment in question was approved by StopAndDecrypt within a couple of minutes *because he was replying directly to it*, and because *it demonstrated the point that obvious vote manipulation was occurring extremely well*. The fact that other comments made by malicious attackers during the same time period were not similarly approved *in no way constitutes evidence of malfeasance*, and yet you're trying to (totally nonsensically) pretend like it does.

>Despite all the comments being blocked or removed as normal that we found, what we did not find was any other examples of anti-r/Bitcoin comments approved or allowed except the comments the bots upvoted. Three snapshots([1] [2] [3]) of the thread in question show no other strongly anti-r/Bitcoin comments present except [CU-1] and [CU-2]; Why did the moderators specifically allow [CU-1] and [CU-2] and nothing else? Perhaps they wanted to reveal the voting patterns, but then why only those comments? Further, by the time of [CU-1], the bot had not upvoted any comments at all. Why would the moderators assume that particular comment and no others would be upvoted, a mere 13 minutes after they ""pulled back the curtain?""

Again, this has already been explained above. Why would we want the thread exposing the vote manipulation to be overrun by the manipulators and sockpuppets in question? The demonstration comment/thread was *more than enough evidence to expose the foul play*, letting more antagonistic comments (intended solely to mislead newcomers) through would make *no sense* at all.

>The next thing we investigated was the behavior of the bots during the ""attack"". How many posts and comments did they downvote? How many did they upvote? What did they pick and were there any obvious correlations? We initially identified only two posts inside /r/Bitcoin that were upvoted by the bots - Both being posts about long delays on the OP's transaction confirmations. 

Did you also examine the vote patterns occurring in /r/btc during the same time period? I personally remember being *incredibly aggressively* downvoted (over a hundred times in a few minutes) *merely for asking not to be harassed*, during the exact same time period as what was happening above.

In other words, I know from firsthand experience that these two comments in /r/Bitcoin weren't the only things being vote brigaded at the time.

>The comments upvoted, too, were specifically chosen. Both comments upvoted were ones attacking /r/Bitcoin over censorship, and without any subtlety. Both comments were in the primary stickied thread with most of the comment downvotes. We quickly determined that the account that posted [CU-1] was under the control of the hacker, something other users also concluded. [CU-2] was posted by a clear /r/Bitcoin supporter based on history. Both comments used words that /r/Bitcoin's automod rules normally silently block [REF-1]. Other comments that subtly denigrated the subreddit's policies were noticed by the bot - but were downvoted instead of upvoted. Why?

It appears that the ""other comment"" (note: **singular**) in question is casting aspersion on /r/Bitcoin policies, and if I had to guess, I would say that it was downvoted because *the attacker(s) had been exposed*, and in fact, the [expository comment in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpngb/) even ""goaded"" the attackers to try and make their comment score -200 rather than +215. Rather than ""giving him what he wanted"" (which would just serve to strengthen the point being made), it seems like the attacker(s) tried to ""muddy the waters"" by doing something that would be uncharacteristic of them to do...

In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems to me that *you* may have been directly involved in this attack. If so, making this thread [is a bold strategy](https://youtu.be/9HVejEB5uVk?t=7), sir.

I don't understand what the counter-hypothesis is, honestly. It seems pretty obvious that whoever was behind the attack decided to downvote comments that one might expect them to upvote (note: *after* having been exposed by /u/BashCo), but if anything that seems to incriminate *this* subreddit, *not* /r/Bitcoin in any way.";33;1;False;thieflar;dq5xuay;"Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

"> separate facts from speculation

There's a credibility issue here. Anti-censorship personas like censorship_notifier begin with high credibility. Pro-censorship personas like yours begin with essentially **no** credibility. So you will have to make a much, much better argument before you will be taken seriously.

If you are serious about disclosing internal moderation policies (which you almost certainly are not), you could open up the mod logs as a first step.

But I don't think you will.

And maybe you can't. You are at the **end** of the moderators list for /r\/Bitcoin (except for the last one, which appears to be a bot that posts only biolerplate text). Which means you are the juniormost. Any of the other moderators can take you off the list if they are displeased by your work. You cannot take any of them off the list.

Maybe you mostly make coffee for all the other people that moderate /r\/Bitcoin 24x7 in three shifts. And if you tried too hard to make them open up the mod logs, you would probably be quickly shown the door.

So I sympathize for your situation.

I've been a lurker on r/BTC and r/Bitcoin for a good while now.  I never believed the censorship FUD until I saw all of the removed posts across https://ceddit.com/r/Bitcoin/.

After seeing this post, I'm very concerned for the community.   There seem to be a handful of people making it very difficult for newcomers in this community.  It's impossible to know who to believe or if what you are reading is some massive conspiracy.  More people in the community helps fuel adoption, helps value stability, and takes Bitcoin out of the realm of ""fake internet money"".  That's what we all want at the end of the day, right?

">Almost immediately after it did so, 4n4n4 screenshotted, archived, and edited the comment. And then the bot's voting attack instantly ceased as far as we can tell [REF-3] [REF-5].

*Yet again*, this seems easily explained by the fact that *4n4n4 caught the attackers red-handed and helped to expose them*. This is further corroborated by the strange up/downvote discrepancies mentioned above.

>The biggest indicator we found is that nullc has the very frequent pattern-- of writing--his sentences with two dashes separating words. This by itself is somewhat rare, though we confirmed that he uses it more times than anyone else in the CN database

That's not very good evidence, especially since your own database screenshot shows others who frequently do the same.

>But there were many more things we noticed. We found several examples of 4n4n4 picking up nullc's conversations and continuing them.

I have done the same, many times. He often stands alone against armies of trolls and ignorance, and since I commonly find him fighting the battles single-handedly, whenever I find an opportunity to help out and debunk whatever nonsense he's fighting against at the time with some knowledge that I *do* have, I have noticed that he tends to drop out of the conversation (rather than repeating the truths that I have made known). I've actually noticed /u/nullc dropping out of a conversation in a similar manner *when other users than myself* do the same thing. It seems like he is most interested in making sure the truth is well-known and available for those interested enough to research for it, and he doesn't often waste his time debunking things that were debunked before he got to them.

I've actually made an explicit mental note of this before (and very much respect him for this). I have been *proud* of some of the instances in which I responded with a quality rebuttal to someone he has been arguing with, and he stops responding to the thread. It indicates that he approves of my own contribution enough to feel comfortable leaving it at that. In other cases (and if I'm being totally honest, more often than not), he'll politely correct the things that I have gotten wrong or extend upon points that I didn't elaborate too deeply on.

>4n4n4 also referenced many of nullc's writings and posts. 4n4n4 referenced this code change that originated from nullc multiple times. 

Okay, sure, good point. There are two possible explanations for this... one is that 4n4n4 is indeed nullc. The other is that:

>Very knowledgable about Bitcoin Core development & the history of the scaling conflict.

**Exactly!**

This, alone, perfectly explains a lot (most? all?) of the similarities you have identified. 4n4n4 seems to have a deep knowledge of Bitcoin on a technical level, and clearly follows Core development closely. In fact, he seems to *like* Gregory Maxwell (assuming that he is not one and the same), which *also* explains why he might have picked up a few posting similarities (like the double-dash habit). This is a real phenomenon: I myself have picked up a few habits from Satoshi, in fact (I had to fight the urge to start using British spellings of certain words after I binged on Satoshi's writings for a few days).

>arguing that low fees and empty mempools are actually a problem.

They **are**, and this is well-known among those who understand Bitcoin on an academic level. Again, this is just another indication that 4n4n4 has a solid understanding of Bitcoin's tech and economics. I myself have made this argument, *many times*. I dare you to accuse me of being a sockpuppet account controlled by Gregory Maxwell; I would consider it an honor.

>Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.

1) The first link is to 4n4n4 *quoting nullc*, which (in my opinion) actually weakens your argument that they are the same person.

2) The first link actually also shows the fact that 4n4n4 is subscribed to the bitcoin-dev mailing list (in his second comment in the link, he mentions that he ""was too lazy to search it after just digging it up in my email""). This, again, seems to corroborate the hypothesis that he is a well-informed person who keeps up-to-date with Bitcoin technical developments, which (again) fairly well explains why he commonly agrees with Maxwell.

3) The second link **directly contradicts what you are claiming!** In it, 4n4n4 says: ""I'm personally running the BIP148 0.3 code right now"" which is *directly* supporting BIP148.";36;3;False;thieflar;dq5xyt1;"Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

"Lightning network.

Here's how a payment channel works in Bitcoin.  You and the other party create a 2-of-2 address, and you both put some money in it.  Any transaction that spends the coins has to be signed by both sides (that's what 2-of-2 means).  Now if you want to send money to them, you create a transaction sending that amount from the 2-of-2 address to their address and the rest back to one of your addresss. You sign the transaction and give it to them.  They sign the transaction, which makes it spendable.  But they don't actually publish it on the blockchain. They simply hold onto it.  Later, if you want to send more money, you create and sign a *different* transaction, giving them more money and you less money.  They don't publish that transaction either.  Every time you want to send them more money, you create a new transaction that gives them more money and gives you less change.  None of those intermediate messages ever get published.  Finally, the two of you are ready to settle up.  You publish the last transaction you agreed to.  That sends the coins out of the 2-of-2 address.  That's called closing the channel.  I'm glossing over some details, because I don't fully understand it myself.  But as far as I know, it's impossible (or nearly impossible) for either party to steal funds.

Now, let's construct a chain of payment channels.  Suppose Alice already has an open channel with Bob, and Bob has an open channel with Carol.  How does Alice send money to Carol?  She contacts Bob and says, ""Send x BTC to Carol.""  Bob sends it.  Then Alice sends the same amount to Bob.  These are payment channel transactions, so none of them have been published on the blockchain yet.  I'm pretty sure there's some mechanism in place to prevent cheating, but I don't know how it works.

The Lightning network is a network of payment channels.  Suppose Alice wants to send money to Dan, but she doesn't want to open a new channel or use the blockchain.  Let's assume both Alice and Dan have a few open channels with different people, but not with each other.  Alice can send a message to the Lightning software, and it will traverse the channels and find a path from Alice to Dan.  Then Alice can send money to Dan without opening a new channel.  Multiply that by a whole lot of people, and anyone can send money to anyone else without necessarily having a channel open between them.

I'm glossing over some big details.  The software to find a route between Alice and Dan hasn't been written yet.  And there are questions about how well the network will scale in practice.  And there are some details I don't understand myself.  But that's the big-picture overview of how a second-layer network would work.";6;0;False;Jonathan_the_Nerd;dq7jfla;Dear Reddit Admins: We need to talk about /r/Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eoxt7/dear_reddit_admins_we_need_to_talk_about_rbitcoin/

"You're missing that Bitcoin is actually the progenitor of decentralized human organization at not only an economic level, but also at a political level.

The FIRST part of that is Bitcoin replacing money - which is effectively an extension to the Internet.  But once that is done and the wider population is comfortable with the idea of decentralized blockchains, what is possible then?

Could a country be run via a blockchain or decentralized government system (perhaps with users voting by anonymous provably unforgeable signed tokens)? How about the UN? The whole world?

Let's try a different example: Automating money is far different to automating music or content creation.  It is now possible to have a robot that self-funds its own creation, operation and expansion. Google could post a public Bitcoin address, link it to whatever is their latest deep learning network and simply let it be. The code itself would be responsible for its own marketing and encouraging the public to donate to it, part of which would be devoted to spinning up new instances of itself with code variations as a kind of Darwinian robotic evolution process.  Before you know it, humanity has true AI.

When the Internet was born, no one could even imagine a fraction of the stuff that you can now quote as historical creations.  Bitcoin will produce stuff that no one NOW can dream of until it's already happened - I'm just giving a couple of examples that hopefully illustrates that same kind of potential definitely exists.";2;0;False;Shibinator;dq77fvg;Dear Reddit Admins: We need to talk about /r/Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eoxt7/dear_reddit_admins_we_need_to_talk_about_rbitcoin/

"When you realize how many people are subjugated and stolen from by way of centrally-dictated monetary policy, you start to see how Bitcoin is revolutionary. Governments pay for wars with their ability to conjure up unlimited supplies of money at will. 

Think about all the unbanked people in the world. They can't get credit cards, they can't use PayPal. They are effectively barred from participating in global commerce. 

Think about all the low-wage migrant workers losing a significant percentage of their wages to wire fees when they send money back home to their families. $10 might not be a lot of money to Western Union, but it could mean a week's worth of meals or a new set of school clothes for someone in a developing country. 

Bitcoin isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, and it's not just a nerdy financial plaything. Bitcoin has the potential to be truly liberating for billions of people around the world.

"u/BeijingBitcoins This was a good post, but it went off the rails repeatedly. 

1. Theymos didn’t embezzle millions of dollars. Theymos put out his begging cup to improve the bitcointalk forum and users tossed a few thousand bitcoins - **worth a few thousand dollars at the time** - into it. He then failed to deliver anything of value from that fundraiser and possibly paid the funds to some inexperienced friends of his in the process. None of this is illegal or even particularly immoral. It just looks bad because of how much the bitcoin *would be* worth today. He didn’t register as a charity or incorporate as a business. None of his benefactors had any actual say in the way he spent the money or any right to demand it be returned. That’s the way unregulated bitcoin transactions work.

2. Bashco was confirmed to be part of a slack user group called the dragons den. This sub assumed, claimed, and has persistently insisted that this must be some nefarious syndicate coordinating social media attacks and generally behaving badly. The people who were part of that group have repeatedly denied that it’s anything more than a discussion group. There is no evidence of any kind. Just lots and lots of speculation.

Including points like those above does your argument no favours. If the admins *do* investigate your claims then having speculative conspiracy theories or misrepresenting the donations scandal is going to count against you in a big way.";1;0;False;tophernator;dq7cpa5;Dear Reddit Admins: We need to talk about /r/Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eoxt7/dear_reddit_admins_we_need_to_talk_about_rbitcoin/

I fear that it is possible that significant criminal elements are at play in the Bitfinix/Tether/Blockstream/Core nexus. If so, then in my opinion some of that criminality has been bolstered by the Reddit Admins. By ignoring their own rules and allowing the r/Bitcoin mods to be unaccountable for their actions, Reddit itself has played a non-trivial role in this enterprise. If the authorities confirm these concerns about criminality and decide to crack down on companies and exchanges that have engaged in fraud and deception, I don't see how the Reddit platform can escape significant scrutiny. If my fears are found to be true, then coming clean to the authorities on a voluntary basis before this thing blows up may be the only way for Reddit to save the platform from significant adverse consequences at this point.;1;0;False;rockhoward;dq71lnd;Dear Reddit Admins: We need to talk about /r/Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eoxt7/dear_reddit_admins_we_need_to_talk_about_rbitcoin/

Slightly off topic... **Reddit is the worst platform for free speech.** The entire idea behind upvotes is counter-intuitive to free speech. Their history with removing content that is offensive speaks for itself. Admins ban communities under the guise that offensive communities are breaking global rules, but they're really being removed because crybabies want to throw a hissyfit.

Looking at history, I think we can learn something.

We have seen that several subs have been closed only *after* reddit as a company came into the mainstream media in a negative light. From the fappening to the scandals the (series of) CEOs have been exposed to which lead to the most hurtful subs to be closed.

The best way to get Reddit to listen is if we;

1. Have actual people get actually hurt, threatened or similar.
2. The mainstream press learns about it.

"It should be obvious to anyone by now. That this sub is incredibly butthurt that their plan on taking over the Bitcoin network didn't go very well. (shocking... I know)

All they do all day is talk about how BCH has lower fees than Bitcoin (you know, just like *every* other alt coin)

These people are extremely short sighted and don't realize a couple of things:


crypto isn't going mainstream this year, or next year, or the next 5 years.

So they don't realize that developers prioritizing on building layers on top of Bitcoin is the right use of resources. 

Just like in evolution, adding more complex systems on top of simpler ones is the way to go. You don't try to do everything on the base layer. 
You don't keep re-inventing the cell to see if humans pop out after enough iterations... No, you build on top of that idea and go from there. And you can even branch out to different use cases from the same base layer.

But these guys don't get that. They think that 8 MB blocks are somehow magically going to make crypto mainstream instantly. They don't realize crypto is a long way from having a proper interface that makes it user friendly. 

By the time user friendly wallets that make it next to impossible to lose your funds because of human error come along, Bitcoin will be buried deep in the layer stack just like the cells on your body are.

When the whole protocol stack is complete. We will get a UI that will blow everyone's mind. 

We'll have things like:

Wallets that prevent you from doing something stupid like sending more funds than you mean to (to say... a twitch streamer) by actually conversing with you and asking you if you mean to send 300 dollars to a twitch streamer, instead of 3.

Wallets that actually talk to you and suggest the best rates based on your needs, location, time, etc.

Wallets that allow you to make the equivalent of testaments so your funds don't just disappear if you die.

 TL;DR: The people here think that adding bigger blocks is going to magically make crypto mainstream. They don't even realize we're not on the beta stage of this technology. We're still building the infrastructure that will enable the applications that will change the world forever...

"A few years ago, the Bitcoin blockchain started reaching maximum capacity, and unconfirmed transactions started building up.  There are two ways to increase capacity: 1) increase the block size so more transactions can be processed, or 2) construct another layer on top of Bitcoin so most transactions can take place off-chain.  People started arguing.  About that time, the mods of /r/bitcoin started removing posts and comments that supported bigger blocks.  The Bitcoin developers started pushing the narrative that the *only* way to safely increase transaction capacity was to push transactions onto layer two solutions.  Dissent was censored.  At some point, someone created /r/btc as a forum for uncensored discussion.  People who were banned from /r/bitcoin migrated here.  As the blockchain started getting more and more congested, the arguments on how to proceed got louder and louder.  The mods of /r/Bitcoin worked overtime to make sure only one side was heard.  Now the differences between the two sides have escalated to ""civil war"" level.

"> I have no doubt bitcoin will succeed but its not the same product as it was when it set out.

But it *is* the same, isn't it?

This is why Segwit was a UASF, and not a hard fork. But that's beside the point.

The point is, that at some point, the base layer only needs a few tweaks to enable scaling on other layers.

You don't just keep making cell bigger, or re-inventing them in nature and expect humans to pop out all of a sudden.

No. You build from the cell, and more complex systems are built on top of it.

Bitcoin will be the foundation of many different ""organisms"" that are very complex.

By the time Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go mainstream, a lot of people won't even know what it is they are using. Just like many humans don't understand how their body works. They just know it works, and the fact that are made of cells, that ended up building organisms that are far more complex than the cell, isn't something that affects their day to day life.

"[Hate speech](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hate_speech)

""Abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.""

It's pretty well defined actually, but I digress. Yes, it can be a subjective term. Where do you draw the line? Is a joke hate speech? Not in my opinion, but others may disagree.

Personally I do agree that those subs should be removed, if they target harassment against a particular group of people or individual. That behavior should be moderated, because it affects other people severely. Just like you should imprison people who steal, assault, murder people etc.

Just because I believe in the freedom of people and human rights, doesn't mean that I feel people should be allowed to get away with anything they do, there is a limit and a line as with everything in life.

I don't go around looking for subs that go against my viewpoint, but please, you sound somewhat intelligent, don't use the ""why don't you focus on all these thousands of other things that are somewhat related to your current point instead of this!"" - I could say the same to you, why don't you go join in with them and help them out?

"**Godwin's law**

Godwin's law (or Godwin's rule of Hitler analogies) is an Internet adage that asserts that ""As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1""; that is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds. Promulgated by the American attorney and author Mike Godwin in 1990, Godwin's law originally referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions. It is now applied to any threaded online discussion, such as Internet forums, chat rooms, and comment threads, as well as to speeches, articles, and other rhetoric where reductio ad Hitlerum occurs.

"Sure! Thanks for asking.

I guess this part comes down to a bit of trust, since you shouldn't have to trust anyone on the Bitcoin *Network*, however this is external so those rules don't exactly apply. It comes down to character and their motives.

So, Roger Ver is a much more ethical person - he's originally a libertarian although he prefers to go by the term 'voluntaryist' now. He strongly believes in helping others form all walks of life, and his vision on Bitcoin reflects this by opening it up to **everyone** as it was originally intended. He doesn't want these sky-high fees pricing people out of the market, nor does he want ""18 months"" (Blockstream buzzword for ""probably never"") of an uphill battle to finally get back to near-zero fees, when you can solve the issue right now and keep allowing for adoption and usability.

Theymos who controls all of these other media has [threatened](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uu3we/bitstamp_will_switch_to_bip_101_this_december/cxi370c/?st=jaakluep&sh=de068506) [multiple](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/?st=jaaklu5z&sh=650d7714) people that they will be effectively exiled from the community if they express support for any fork that wasn't Blockstream's vision. This is a hijacking of Bitcoin, and despite the immense downvotes he received from the users showing that there was no consensus to his view, he went ahead with it all anyway.

He also funnelled off around 7000 BTC that was donated/raised to create a new sleek forum for bitcointalk - which just upped and disappeared. He claims to have sent it to some two-man operation after months (years) of sitting on it, and they still have the same forum.

Meanwhile, you have Roger Ver, the ""convicted criminal!!!!"" as Core love to spout as part of their character assassination strategy. He was convicted under some *EXPLOSIVES* charge (pun intended). This sounds terrible. In reality, he was selling fireworks that were incorrectly labelled as something else (fertilizer or something).

"Removing toxicity isn't censorship. **That** is moderation.

This is the confusion that /r/bitcoin moderators & supporters can't comprehend as well as rational people.

The mods at /r/bitcoin claim ""moderation"", however by highlighting the ways they stamp out 'dissenting information' and allow scathing attacks but no positive messages about certain topics, whilst deleting things that aren't in-line with their views, this is clearly censorship.

Moderation (all things in moderation) exists to remove toxic people. For example; if someone starts to ""wish cancer and death upon all your family"" - banning this person is not 'censorship', it's common sense moderation.

Removing communities that follow that same line of thought, encouraging witch-hunting, doxxing, hate speech, etc., is moderation and not censorship.

However, I fully understand that for anyone supporting Core in this, it's a seriously difficult line to draw for you.

No. They'd keep the $30 million. They invalidate a IOU that says they owe $30 million to who ever has the USDT. If they want to keep that $30 million in USDT they can invalidate that of the hacker and then issue new freshly minted $30 million USDT to correspond to what they have in their reserves. They sure could be running a fractional reserve of Tether. But this notion that because they have Tether means they must be buying up BTC out of thin air makes no sense when not a single exchange needs Tether to do this can can do it internally.

">So in that scenario, if I hold both of these currencies and all the people I buy goods and services from accept both, sure my incentive is to first spend the inflationary currency. But that's going to be everyone else's incentive too. If nobody wants to hold the inflationary currency, its value is going to collapse and it will cease to be money, having been completely eclipsed by the better, deflationary money.

Having an incentive to spend, rather than hoard a currency, does not imply that no one wants to accept a currency, it means they only want to accept it so they can then use it to spend on other things. That's all a currency needs to do.

Moderate inflation doesn't discourage people from accepting a currency. all the most commonly accepted currencies in the world are inflationary. it only discourages holding money over long time periods of time, which makes it a better currency, not a worse one, since money held over a long time is not facilitating trade, which means its not generating wealth or helping to optimize the economy.

We see in cases like Zimbabwe that even when a government recklessly hyperinflates a currency to uselessness, people prefer just to switch to another more stable inflationary currency, like US dollars, than switch back to a deflationary currency like gold. Deflationary currency only seems to get used if there's absolutely no other stable inflationary currency available. 

>its value is going to collapse and it will cease to be money, having been completely eclipsed by the better, deflationary money.

When you examine examples of Greshams law in real life, you see the opposite of what you suggest would happen.

By this argument, base metal coins should all have become worthless because there were better, more deflationary precious metal coins available, and mints kept degrading the value of base metal coins. But the opposite is true. Precious metal coins are almost entirely out of use as currency precisely because everyone hoarded them and so they ceased to be used as currency. 

>. When you don't exercise that claim immediately (and instead stick the money under the mattress) those real resources remain available to be used by others for either consumption or investment. That forbearance on your part thus is generating value for others.

Not taking up resources isn't an act that creates value. Dead people also don't take up resources, they're not producing any value. The best you can be talking about is a zero-sum transfer of wealth to other people, since taking money out of supply helps deflate the supply and increase the unit value.

If we just destroyed half the dollars in the world it would instantly make the dollar twice as valuable but it wouldn't have generated any wealth. 

Trade generates value by facilitating wealth creation and pareto optimizing. This isn't just moving wealth from one pocket to another its increasing the overall amount of wealth. 

Deflation ensures that any act of wealth creation/optimizing via trade will not take place unless you can expect to make a greater profit from the trade than you can by simply holding onto the currency. Why invest in a new form of production that makes 5% return if simply sitting on your money makes 6%?

Pontifical universities are ""academic institutes established or approved directly by the Holy See, composed of three main ecclesiastical faculties (Theology, Philosophy and Canon Law) and at least one other faculty. These academic institutes deal specifically with the Christian revelation and related disciplines, and the Church’s mission of spreading the Gospel, as proclaimed in the Apostolic Constitution both"" Sapientia christiana"". Many of them, on the other hand, have most of their students studying secular topics.

Pontifical universities follow a European system of degrees in the sacred faculties, granting the baccalaureate, the licentiate, and the doctorate.

**Pontifical Gregorian University**

The Pontifical Gregorian University (Italian: Pontificia Università Gregoriana; also known as the Gregoriana) is a pontifical university located in Rome, Italy. It was originally a part of the Roman College founded in 1551 by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, and included all grades of schooling. The university division of philosophy and theology of the Roman College was given Papal approval in 1556, making it the first university founded by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). In 1584 the Roman College was given a grandiose new home by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom it was renamed.

The [first one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Gregorian_University) was established in Rome by the Jesuits in the mid 1500s.  There are a couple hundred clones in many countries with a significant Catholic population.

They are ""private"" in the sense that they charge tuition and are not managed by the State.  However the are (AFAIK) not run for profit, but as self-sufficient non-profit philanthropic organizations.  In Brazil there are also many high schools operated by various branches of the Catholic Church, some as old as the country itself; and a few universities run by other organized religions, like the Methodists.  Some of these may be run for profit, to help finance the parent organization.

The Catholic Church cares especially about the courses in Theology and other Church-relevant degrees, but Pontifical Universities usually have courses on all areas, like other universities.  They are open to students and faculty of any religion.

"Hit the nail on the head my friend. It is 100% NOT sustainable in the long term. 


They used to have a pretty firm grasp on literally all Bitcoin discussion - which makes doing this 100x easier. The cracks in the dam have started to split together... And instead of a small trickle of water escaping, we are seeing so much water, that it's formed a river, which is flowing away from the structurally defunct dam (which could collapse at any time).

Obviously the ""water"" is in reference to the BTC users themselves - for anybody who didn't graduate k-6.";19;1;False;stephenfraizer;dq662un;What /r/bitcoin mods desperately don't want you to see!;https://i.imgur.com/C8PyBB5.png

"Thanks, here are my thoughts on it

> a new currency

Both forks are the same age

>that many Bitcoin supporters  view as a rival.

that many **casual and uninformed** Bitcoin supporters  view as a rival.



>that many hardcore Bitcoiners view as an unwanted stepchild of Bitcoin 

that **many new comers and those who never wanted to use bitcoin** view as an unwanted stepchild of Bitcoin 

> potential threat to the top cryptocurrency.

but the top currency would still be bitcoin


>group of Bitcoiners who disagree ideologically with the future development plans for the original cryptocurrency

group of Bitcoiners who agreed ideologically with the future development plans for the original cryptocurrency (how could someone get this so backwards?)


>Bitcoin Cash has come under criticism from the Bitcoin community for its small developer community, 

the fact it has 3 dev teams and not 1?

Or that it *hasn't* pushed away over a hundred people. Bitcoin core has something like 25 significant developers if I remember correctly, most other people came and left


>t how decentralized the cryptocurrency actually is.

again, because it has *more* development teams? Also decentralization in bitcoin is all about miners.
