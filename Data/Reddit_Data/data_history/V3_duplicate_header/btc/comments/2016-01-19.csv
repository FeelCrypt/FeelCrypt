"Undoubtedly some good work has been done by Core in removing some barriers to Bitcoin scaling. However, they've also introduced other features that have little-to-no use case. In particular, non-FSS-RBF, which has been shunned by the very group it was supposed to benefit: mining pools.

I'm also struggling to think of a real use-case for HODL (time locked) transactions, at least at this point in time.";1;0;False;;cz3hizw;Some advice for everybody at this point in time;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41ipkd/some_advice_for_everybody_at_this_point_in_time/

"> **OPTION TWO** - Introduce Segwit. About 500 lines of new code, of which at least 100 in the hypersensitive consensus code. Requires upgrading a majority of server software _and **all** client/wallet software and client/wallet **hardware,** especially those needing to pay money to an arbitrary address_ (as Segwit introduces a new type of address that both sender and receiver must handle).

This is my main concern, the precedent it sets for future changes. A contentious hard fork degrades consensus permanently.

"And users not necessarily realize the dynamic of open-source programs. Right now there's a high sense of entitlement among users where they demand things as if they were paying customers, which they aren't.
