Why did you edit instead of responding? Completely changing what you said. And Litecoin is not better lmao.;1;0;False;scottieboiy;e5l6i4r;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/
"No, gold isn‚Äôt touted as a decentralized currency. It‚Äôs a precious metal. Currencies should be reasonable to spend. 

Im not calling it a scam, just saying what others will say when hit with crazy fees. Which will be inevitable just like the last bull run. You say ‚Äúif somehow fees increase too much‚Äù as if it didn‚Äôt already happen before. And lightning network doesn‚Äôt work. If it did Bitcoin would not be at 6k right now. BCH isn‚Äôt a scam coin it‚Äôs a fork. A better bitcoin. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And I was just making a joke since you had links ready to fire.

"- Lol that‚Äôs what gives digital currencies their value. Lol at the switch from calling it a p2p currency to store of value once it showed it couldn‚Äôt handle the load.

- Lol at no scaling
Lol it works better than core and could actually handle a bull run.";1;1;False;scottieboiy;e5l0hjs;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/

That is a good criteria to use. Did 30% of all users do this or did the criteria get stretched at some point? ";1;0;False;Mr_Again;e5lshy4;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/
If the Bitcoin fees increase too much for censorship resistant coffee and for some unknown reason lightning network is absent, people aren't aren't going to use a scam coin. There are better Bitcoin fork options like Litecoin and Vertcoin. Then there are non fork options which are also much better like  Dogecoin and Monero.

"Yeah so I gave my BCH wallet to the nigerian prince for fixing, he is going to send you BCH but he needs 100BCH to open a Lightning Network channel in a watchtower so he can watch the wallet sending the transaction you know.

So just send him the 100BCH first and he is going to send you 50 BCH - that's a promise.";1;0;False;ShadowOfHarbringer;e5l08x0;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/

"Yup. If I can not spend a US dollar it is worthless. If there are better alternatives I will then move to them. When I can‚Äôt send a digital CURRENCY reasonably, I will not hold it. 

Bitcoin scarcity does not inherently make it valuable, as it is not the only one of its kind. If it was the only crypto then sure.
