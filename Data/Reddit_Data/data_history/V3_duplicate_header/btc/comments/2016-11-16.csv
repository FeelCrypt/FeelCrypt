My point is that core is a key player because the miners listen to core for advice.

It's not just the Reddit Sub. The main developer mailing list is censored. The Github repo for Core is censored. The (currently) most popular discussion board related to bitcoin (bitcointalk.org) is also heavily censored.

"Hard forks are dangerous. It's good that the Core developers figured out a way to avoid them. Ethereum shows this in stark contrast.

"> Yes, the price is rising, but how do you know that it wouldn't have been much higher (or lower) had the fork happened, or wouldn't have started rising a year ago instead of being rocked by panics infighting?

">The question isn't whether the price is going up. The question is whether the price is anywhere near what it would be without the interference. That is a hard question to answer, but a mere reversal from an extreme bear market reaction to an absolutely historic bull market (10000% growth in 2013!) is not evidence of anything, except that Bitcoin still works adequately. 

I think trying to figure out what the price *would have been* had some other course of action been taken is pretty pointless. I only take things that have happened as facts. The price will continue to bubble as it always has done. I'm happy that it's going up, and as long as keeps breaking its all-time high, I see no reason to panic. I get the sense that people think long-term holders will get bored of bitcoin and sell. This is absolutely not the case. 

>That said, I do agree that we can easily fork away in the future, once it's overwhelmingly clear to even the miners that the current Core devs are harming Bitcoin (in the short term; anti-fragility means all harm is short-term, of course). People in /r/btc tend to be overly worried, and in the other sub underly worried. Take action to depose Core (and depose any central dev power from anywhere, I might add), but know that it will happen sooner or later no matter what we do here, so that we can continue discussing the future and building the infrastructure that will rely on a high-capacity Bitcoin, as nothing - certainly no devs and petty dictators - can stop it.

"I find it notably suspicious that so many people were pretty reasonable before censorship d-day happened. Theymos used to be kinda reasonable and say smart stuff, as the article notes. Several blockstreamers came out with various on-chain scaling proposals. 

But then, something clearly happened to change their minds in a radical way. They started contradicting themselves and acting... Oddly? I don't think stuff like the 2-4-8 proposal was made in bad faith. I don't think they were just stalling.

I can't help but wonder what it was really. Perhaps some money changed hands? Is it really the Bilderberg/AXA conspiracy theory? Did blockstream just have a meeting and realize the potential to push their business model via sidechains?";2;0;False;garoththorp;da2avx2;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
