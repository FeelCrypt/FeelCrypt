A LN node uses private keys to sign commitment transaction that change the balance of the channel (send money somewhere). If your LN node is compromised it can pay the invoice of an attacker by signing a corresponding commitment transaction (using a private key) by routing the funds to them.

LN node need to continuously sign CTs, each CT is signed with a private key that is accessible from that LN node. If that LN node is compromised, so will be that private key.

This means that both Bob and i create a commit transaction of a total value of 50.

"I actually like the term ""gossip"" because it's a very chatty system, but it's really just state broadcasting. 

From what I've gathered so far (which is actually kind of difficult to find without reading through the code itself) is that each state much broadcast it's balance and a list of nodes it's connected to. I haven't been able to figure out how frequently this ""must"" happen.

It seems like the network will start to misbehave, and deteriorate rather rapidly, relatively soon once it has both enough nodes and enough transactions.

Since LN currently has no ""centralized"" routing hosts (which is one routing solution proposed), every node needs to understand the topology and funding of paths through the network to valid routes. At high levels of traffic, assuming not everything is going through a hub (seems like a likely workaround for this issue -- predicting many future responses to the tune of _""you're using it wrong, connect to node <X, Y, or Z> and your problems are solved""_). 

As many engineers are aware already, convoluted state is a nightmare and this introduces the most challenging state management I've ever seen. How do you know when you need to update your data on a node? What happens in race conditions? (your transactions fail and you have to try again)

I can potentially see LN or a similar side-chain being _useful_ on coins with already-low chain transactions, where you open a channel to another node/business and use this for streaming payments -- something like paying for electricity directly for every watt used (though due to price tiering this might be a bad example ;) -- maybe internet and data, or video content are better examples). I imagine in this scenario connecting to hubs wouldn't be that bad, you might have a hub for paying utilities for example. Though even with this, you can do faux-streaming payments on-chain if you are batching payments.

All that said, using this implementation of LN/side-chain as a mechanism to ""scale"" a base layer sounds like it's going to be a nightmare on so many fronts.

"Hash was the wrong word. I apologise - it is not my area of expertise. Here is the section from the whitepaper. Section 5 - Key Storage

""Keys are generated using BIP 0032 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets[17].
Keys are pre-generated by both parties. Keys are generated in a merkle
tree and are very deep within the tree. For instance, Alice pre-generates
one million keys, each key being a child of the previous key. Alice allocates
which keys to use according to some deterministic manner. For example,
she starts with the child deepest in the tree to generate many sub-keys for
day 1. This key is used as a master key for all keys generated on day 1.
She gives Bob the address she wishes to use for the next transaction, and
discloses the private key to Bob when it becomes invalidated. When Alice
discloses to Bob all private keys derived from the day 1 master key and does
not wish to continue using that master key, she can disclose the day 1 master
key to Bob. At this point, Bob does not need to store all the keys derived
from the day 1 master key. Bob does the same for Alice and gives her his
day 1 key.
When all Day 2 private keys have been exchanged, for example by
day 5, Alice discloses her Day 2 key. Bob is able to generate the Day 1 key
from the Day 2 key, as the Day 1 key is a child of the Day 2 key as well.
If a counterparty broadcasts the wrong Commitment Transaction,
which private key to use in a transaction to recover funds can either be
brute forced, or if both parties agree, they can use the sequence id number
41when creating the transaction to identify which sets of keys are used.
This enables participants in a channel to have prior output states
(transactions) invalidated by both parties without using much data at all.
By disclosing private keys pre-arranged in a merkle-tree, it is possible to
invalidate millions of old transactions with only a few kilobytes of data per
channel. Core channels in the Lightning Network can conduct billions of
transactions without a need for significant storage costs.""

Exactly.

With LN, the private key needs to be accessible by a node that is accepting incoming connections from the internet. This is more risky than a Bitcoin wallet that only needs to broadcast a signed transaction.

**LN is worse in terms of attack surface/risk profile. LN is far better in terms of confirmation times and number of tx per seconds.**

But you claimed that there is no increase in risk because

- the LN node does not have access to the private key but only its hash
- the LN node has access to the private key, but the attacker can't use it to steal funds
- the attacker can steal funds but not escape from LN

Of course actual LN will be more complex than my example. Of course routing payments for third parties will rebalance your channels with others. That does not change the fact though, that you can't escape the constraints set up by locking your funds.

"Routing payments *may* rebalence channels.  Thus in the simplest possible case if A has a channel to B and A pays B then a payment from B will rebalence the channel.  Also,  if channels are funded with large amounts and most transactions are small then the state of each channel can be quantized and hysteresis applied so that small transactions will have no effect on channel state for the ""next"" transaction to be routed.  And if the network topology has a single hub then the routing problem becomes completely trivial.  Thus it is possible to come up with contrived examples of workloads, channel topologies, and channel funding where the system might ""work"".  However, it is not at all clear that the cost of these configurations (especially the capital tied up in open channels) will make the LN competitive with just using layer 1. 

 u/jstolfi and I have repeatedly asked the LN developers to come up with sample workloads and topologies and use these to evaluate the resulting network performance.  They have not done this and they continue to claim that LN has unlimited scalability. I conclude that it is a waste of time to argue with LN promoters, since they don't know what they don't know and are unwilling to follow up on suggestions that would open them to escape from their ignorance.

"**Dijkstra's algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the ""source"" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.

"> A LN node uses private keys to sign commitment transaction that change the balance of the channel (send money somewhere). 

it uses children of the private key that are HD generated. 

>  If your LN node is compromised it can pay the invoice of an attacker by signing a corresponding commitment transaction (using a private key) by routing the funds to them.

yes - i imagine that if your node is compromised then you have a problem. When would this not be a problem in any other system? if your computer is compromised, do you have an issue? The thing is that the master private key cannot be derived from the children - so the transaction that is malicious can never be settled - as the attacker does not have the master private key needed to settle the transaction. 

> LN node need to continuously sign CTs, each CT is signed with a private key that is accessible from that LN node. If that LN node is compromised, so will be that private key.

see above

> LN nodes need to be online for payment exchange and they need to have control over the funds in your channel (and thus they need to have access to the corresponding private keys).

yes. 

below is the section from the paper. it would be easier if you downloaded and read it yourself. Sorry about the formatting - i couldn't be arsed fixing it, as i am in the office. 

""Commitment Transactions: Unenforcible Construction

After the unsigned (and unbroadcasted) Funding Transaction has been cre-
ated, both parties sign and exchange an initial Commitment Transaction.

These Commitment Transactions spends from the 2-of-2 output of the Fund-
ing Transaction (parent). However, only the Funding Transaction is broad-
cast on the blockchain.

Since the Funding Transaction has already entered into the
blockchain, and the output is a 2-of-2 multisignature transaction which

requires the agreement of both parties to spend from, Commitment Trans-
actions are used to express the present balance. If only one 2-of-2 signed

Commitment Transaction is exchanged between both parties, then both
parties will be sure that they are able to get their money back after the
Funding Transaction enters the blockchain. Both parties do not broadcast
the Commitment Transactions onto the blockchain until they want to close
out the current balance in the channel. They do so by broadcasting the
present Commitment Transaction.
Commitment Transactions pay out the respective current balances to

each party. A naive (broken) implementation would construct an unbroad-
casted transaction whereby there is a 2-of-2 spend from a single transaction

which have two outputs that return all current balances to both channel

counterparties. This will return all funds to the original party when creat-
ing an initial Commitment Transaction.""

and the next section is the security model

""Since any signed Commitment Transaction may be broadcast on the
blockchain, and only one can be successfully broadcast, it is necessary
to prevent old Commitment Transactions from being broadcast. It is
not possible to revoke tens of thousands of transactions in Bitcoin, so an
alternate method is necessary. Instead of active revocation enforced by
the blockchain, it’s necessary to construct the channel itself in similar
manner to a Fidelity Bond, whereby both parties make commitments, and
11
violations of these commitments are enforced by penalties. If one party
violates their agreement, then they will lose all the money in the channel.
For this payment channel, the contract terms are that both parties
commit to broadcasting only the most recent transaction. Any broadcast of
older transactions will cause a violation of the contract, and all funds are
given to the other party as a penalty.
This can only be enforced if one is able to ascribe blame for broadcasting
an old transaction. In order to do so, one must be able to uniquely
identify who broadcast an older transaction. This can be done if each counterparty
has a uniquely identifiable Commitment Transaction. Both parties
must sign the inputs to the Commitment Transaction which the other party
is responsible for broadcasting. Since one has a version of the Commitment
Transaction that is signed by the other party, one can only broadcast one’s
own version of the Commitment Transaction.""";1;1;False;midipoet;duhh68s;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc

"I suggest you study the LN white paper.  When you use a route it consumes funds in the channel.  As a simple example, if the network consists of channels from A and B to C, a channel from C to D and channels from D to E and F,  when A sends funds to E it will use funds from C's balance on the channel from C to D.  If the remaining funds are zero, or insufficient, then it will be impossible for B to send funds to F.   Accordingly, B needs to know about the change on the channel from C to D even though he never exchanges funds with A or E.  

None of this is obvious, by the way, except for people who have studied network flows, and algorithms to allocate and/or optimally allocate resources in networks.  However, to computer engineers and scientists who have worked in these areas, this will be somewhat obvious.

This is obvious and not relevant for my point, but I am glad you had an epiphany despite not being a computer engineer.

> If I use LN at timestamps A and B, the amount of routed payments between A and B do not impact my cost of finding a route at B.

The cost for my route discovery at timestamp B does not change if there are a 100 payments or 100000 payments between A and B.

I don't need to keep up with all topology changes between A and B because most will be outdated anyway when I need to find a route at B.

So, routing payments will rebalance channels (as I argue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7yfjkn/rick_falkvinge_on_the_lightning_network/dugl9rt/)) and change topology which makes route discovery more challenging in general (as I argued [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7yfjkn/rick_falkvinge_on_the_lightning_network/dugkqgu/)).

"**Gossip protocol**

A gossip protocol is a procedure or process of computer-computer communication that is based on the way social networks disseminate information or how epidemics spread. It is a communication protocol. Modern distributed systems often use gossip protocols to solve problems that might be difficult to solve in other ways, either because the underlying network has an inconvenient structure, is extremely large, or because gossip solutions are the most efficient ones available.

The term epidemic protocol is sometimes used as a synonym for a gossip protocol, because gossip spreads information in a manner similar to the spread of a virus in a biological community.

As far as I understand it, IOTA is targeting mainly IOT manufacturers, who want their smart devices to be able to quickly and autonomously perform micro transactions between devices. So those companies would run the nodes that their devices connect to.

"> Yes it is. When you send money via LN you need to sign new transactions for your 2-by-2 multsig onchain address. No access to your private key, no signatures.

Page 7 of the LN whitepaper, Section 3.1.1

""An initial channel Funding Transaction is created whereby one or both chan-
nel counterparties fund the inputs of this transaction. Both parties create
the inputs and outputs for this transaction but do not sign the transaction.
The output for this Funding Transaction is a single 2-of-2 multisigna-
ture script with both participants in this channel, henceforth named Alice
and Bob. Both participants do not exchange signatures for the Funding
Transaction until they have created spends from this 2-of-2 output refund-
ing the original amount back to its respective funders. The purpose of not
signing the transaction allows for one to spend from a transaction which
does not yet exist. If Alice and Bob exchange the signatures from the Fund-
ing Transaction without being able to broadcast spends from the Funding
Transaction, the funds may be locked up forever if Alice and Bob do not
cooperate (or other coin loss may occur through hostage scenarios whereby
one pays for the cooperation from the counterparty).
Alice and Bob both exchange inputs to fund the Funding Transaction
7(to know which inputs are used to determine the total value of the channel),
and exchange one key to use to sign with later. This key is used for the
2-of-2 output for the Funding Transaction; both signatures are needed to
spend from the Funding Transaction, in other words, both Alice and Bob
need to agree to spend from the Funding Transaction.""";-7;1;False;midipoet;dugq3o2;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc

"One thing that really really bugs me.  As a network engineer, I started looking into how the LN finds a payment path (i.e. route) through the network a couple of months ago and found these same issues.  Also, there's been no reports or papers published since 2016 on possible methods for solving the routing issues.  I recently was told by someone running a node on LN that the current implementation on mainnet uses broadcasts to advertise active nodes and their channel states.  Oh boy... well that's not going to scale, so they aren't even testing a routing solution at this point.

I'm really baffled about two things.  

1.  How can work go on without solving this fundamental lower level problem?  Building wallets and node software is great but its like building a really fast racecar that you intend to drive over mountains with no roads built.  

2.  Andreas Antonopolos - great guy, I've learned a lot watching his vids.

"You proved the point with your own confused comment. To clarify, NO, it is NOT easy to use email. And that's the point.

Email is easy to use because it has made a lot of compromises, some of which include centralization, censorship, etc.

You say there are other providers, but just take a look at the market share. Most of the world population use centralized email providers for their email therefore none of them truly ""own"" their email. 

And the reason why centralization is an important factor in this problem is because the very #1 reason why BTC advocates criticize BCH is because they say BCH centralizes Bitcoin. The only obvious way that lightning network can implement better user experience is through centralization.

If we end up with that reality, people will need to choose between a trusted banks they already use, or centralized lightning network servers. I'm sure most people will choose the banks because they have been around for much much longer and much more trustworthy.

I'm not even talking about whether centralization is good or bad anymore. Even if we assume centralization is OK, when building a new product and you want to gain traction, you need to find a niche where the product can compete effectively against incumbents. It's called ""positioning"". There have never been a case where a newcomer did pretty much the same thing as what incumbents were doing and succeeded.

"And LN supporters always bring up the example of BGP, when asked how routing will work.

First, BGP itself already has huge issues with scaling. BGP routing tables are growing larger & larger, and it's already caused issues where older devices can no longer store the table in memory.

But the really big problem, is stability. BGP doesn't handle changes in network topology well. If a big change in the network occurs, it can often take several minutes for this change to propagate through. And in the meantime, certain routes will be unroutable. On the internet this isn't such a big issue, as ISP's maintain a pretty stable topology. But how well is this going to work with LN, where every channel update potentially represents a change in topology? If the channel updates are frequent enough, BGP routing could become so unstable that it isn't even possible to find a working route, and then the whole system collapses.";9;0;False;biggest_decision;duh2ce6;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc

"You are in good company. I have been doing network engineering for decades and the comparisons with internet routing are completely misguided.

First, on the internet, routes are dynamic for end users. You send a packet, and you literally have no idea how it will reach the destination. Each router just forwards it on, and eventually it should get to the right place. Now, with BGP it is more complex, as it requires many larger entities to manage complex routing tables, it is amazing how low tech BGP actually is.

Now compare that to LN. The routes need to be pre-computed. It is not dynamic at all. Therefore if any node during your pre-selected route fails, or doesn't have enough liquidity, then the transaction fails, and you have to try again. In the real world, machines go offline, people get DDoS'd, and there is no guarantee a route will work reliably.

Just to clarify - Do you contend that as the network grows larger - exponentially larger - that nodes will continue to know this state information and that the state information of the entire network will be accurate when a transaction is to be sent?

What is the point of something that works great until it starts hitting real world volumes?  By that time so much opportunity will be lost, some much sunk cost, how would it be possible to ever recover?

"There’s a few things here that we are over emphasising. Maybe I’m wrong but feel free to correct me

1. Lost money already on the LN. Yes, it’s bad. And gives bad pr. To all crypto, cause all crypto is painted with the same brush to the guy on the street whether you like it or not. There are bugs with any software and they will be sorted, and then more come etc. Whenever an exchange or wallet gets hacked (think the recent nem one) do everyday people realise it was an exchange not the blockchain? Fact is people don’t differentiate, only people here who care to know how the tech works. The average end user will never lose money as he will be banked, and the bank will be insured...see point 2.

2. You must always be online. I think if LN ever goes big the average Joe will use a ‘bank’ who pays for the channel and stays online. So no initial on-loading fee. Hell the bank already has all your details so there is no problem opening up a LN channel with them. Then you have access to this account to send/receive funds. Average Joe doesn’t care about killing central banks and just wants the easiest payment method possible. This also solves the routing problem as banks will cooperate with eachother if there is money to be made, also your data and what you buy etc.

3. All crypto wallets will become secure in the future. Stop fretting over it. This shit will be sorted out (I seen an nchain video before about the idea of how to sort the keys issue, obviously this will only be on bch, but my point is the wallets will get better in the next year or two)

4. Attacks will always happen. Again get over it. Just because you can see obvious vectors does not mean there are not obvious solutions. Do I know any? No. But the internet does its magic and average people don’t get hacked or don’t see child porn on facebook. Again, if the tech looks like it is taking off then methods we never considered will be thought up. This is the type of market insurance companies will make a killing off in the not too distant future.

So all in all LN sounds cool to me.

But
Is it really any better than the current banking?
I mean...would the regular person actually start using this?
Why don’t the ECB just go digital, issue the Euro crypto, get all banks to run the LN.
End user won’t give a fuck, like I say decentraliation is over hyped in this space (see below) I mean people today dont care about google or facebook keeping data and selling it on so I promise you 90% of what we hold dear doesn’t matter to 99% of future users. 
So the truth is the LN and any crypto that will be used as a currency is totally fucking useless

Except for the people who dont have a bank.
Now we are talking, this is where crypto will make its real inroads. Starting with remittances then eventually to direct crypto transfers between people. Then to shops in asia/africa accepting it

Anyone in the first world can benefit from crypto, but we don’t really need it. It’s not life changing. To a few billion people it is. So quick free transactions which you don’t need to sign up to any ‘bank’ for are the game changer. 

This is the number one flaw of the LN - they are not considering who their actual userbase will be. Who needs crypto more than anyone? For this reason alone, I am fully confident in BCHs future plans
