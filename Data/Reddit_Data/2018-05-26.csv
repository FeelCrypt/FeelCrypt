"I guess it depends on how you define ""we."""
That's not what I mean. You can't live in a walled environment impervious to outside influence. Some of that outside influence will be violent. That's why it's called the Byzantine Generals Problem, not the Byzantine Hippies Problem.
Right but we don’t tolerate it. If someone is violent towards us we retaliate or run. We don’t sit and take beatings for the rest of our lives. In this context success isn’t predicated on how well we tolerate violence. It’s predicated on how well we irradiate it. 
I think that every human interaction and relationship aught to be voluntary. If it isn’t then my tolerance is zero. There are certainly solutions that are voluntary. 
There is never a non-aggressive solution. It just depends on your ethical tolerance as to what is acceptable.
"Nah I don’t think it would be that extreme. I’m guessing it would be like a Pareto. But that could still be cause for some gaps that may be distressing.

In any case when the richest person dies the likelihood that all their wealth would go to exactly one other person seems unlikely, and in a free market the chance for someone to ascend to the top and displace that singular successful person is always present. 

I just meant that the tendency to accumulation in a few hands is present and it causes some folks to really fret. Fret so much they propose forced redistribution. I don’t agree with their proposed solutions but their concerns aren’t unfounded. "
Yeah tech could be the non-aggressive solution. War is certainly effective at destroying wealth but handing everyone a brick isn’t the same thing as redistribution of the value of a mansion.
While I did reference Pareto, it's not a scientific law, it's a superstitious belief. To take your rich person death analogy a bit further, wars tend to redistribute wealth more evenly when empires fall. Inevitably some social version of entropy will even the distribution of wealth among all people, probably through technology where AI machines control all the money.
You don't really believe only one person will own everything? 
I hate to burst your bubbles but there is no wealth transfer. Whales still control majority of coins and tokens. It’s a nice image to paint for ourselves and all but reality doesn’t give a fuck.
Sure.

"""Blockchain"" is currently a buzzword like ""Cloud"". It doesn't mean jack shit.

Blockchain as a technical solution is just a terribly inefficient database system which can be easily replaced with better solutions such as MySQL or even Git.

Only when merged with PoW and incentive schemes created by Satoshi (meaning: Bitcoin(Cash)) ""Blockchain"" starts to make sense.

Blockchain is not magic and not jack of all trades. It is only good for solving a narrow range of problems: 

- Need of of trust in financial systems
- Byzantine Generals problem (EDIT: **using PoW**)
- Unique Identification problem

This is really the essence of what ""Blockchain"" is good for. The rest are just extensions."
"I guess you're right that its kinda both, the solution being that by seeing the number of blocks mined the generals can estimate the hashpower and therefor size of the consensus group.

It always felt to me like PoW was doing the heavy lifting here but rather than debate those semantics it would seem to make more sense to just link the solution 
 and agree that PoW/block make up exactly as much of the solution as the solution describes. https://nakamotostudies.org/2008/11/13/re-bitcoin-p2p-e-cash-paper-9/"

"I don't think Ethereum understands what does and doesn't need to be on the blockchain. A lot of calculations can be done offchain, which removes the need for gas. 

Ethereum is already running into scaling hiccups. I can't help but wonder if BCH will be way more efficient at the use cases that matter most for practical business. Remove the hype and smart contracts are really just transactions whose payout conditions can be arbitrarily complex. We have that in BCH, without gas. It will just take a while for people to figure out how to use it.

True.
"Yes, that't easy. I have a degree in IT you know.

"Yes the horse is slow, it’s annoying, it bites, it shits everywhere and everyone seems to be riding one right now. Entire markets are being built around “horse” related products. But yet this horse is unique, there was no other horse before it, and Satoshi only described what a horse looked like. 
 
Industries yet to be discovered:
- horse  related vet science 
- racing your horses 
- training your horse to do tricks
- breed them and discover horse genetics!  Woo 

If Blockchain was the theory electromagnetism, then Bitcoin network is the implementation as basic lithium-ion battery, Satoshi describes in his paper of a “cathode/anode thing stuck in a lemon that will heat up a piece of metal, to produce light”.  

And the world’s biggest manufacturers of candles (the banks, financial services industry etc) aren’t too sure how this will affect their candle monopoly, because it  potentially take their whole business, or they could restructure their business model to use electricity to produce more candles, more effectively, globally to those who are yet to discover fire. 

So we’re seeing fairly divided opinions from these candle experts about the fruit industry; and a lot of noise trying to sell “scented lemons candle shaped like horses”. See the biggest winners in the coming years will be the ones that utilization of the sciences behind the horse, in their respective markets to refactor or scale their business, rather than trying to spin off a horse related project.

"> I can see another powerful reason for using a blockchain: while they are inefficient, they provide a standard, universal protocol that works.

Only when combined with Bitcoin Cash (or Ethereum).

Without PoW (and enough accumulated difficulty), blockchain does not have this property. "
Such a trivial problem, right?
"> The Byzantine Generals problem is solved by PoW, not the blockchain.

Yes, this is what I meant however I wrote the post in a rush."
I'm just glad it was on the list since I'm always telling people the blockchain only does a few things well. That's why if you're going to start a blockchain company it should have to do with one of those things. Virtual Reality and AI for instance are not really related to blockchain, but people use it for the hype. Identity works really well however, that's why we're building ReceipCoin.
As of a week or two ago. Bcash has been the annoying short version of Bitcoin cash since it came out. I guess it could be called BitCash but it's not the Bitcoin so it's a bit deceitful to have the Bitcoin name in it
"It's not for ethereum to decide what does and doesn't need to be on the blockchain.  Just like it isn't apples job to decide what should and shouldnt be an app.  They offer a backbone to the apps and those that have value will remain and those that don't will disappear.  

Ethereum already has off chain scaling options.  As for it already running into scaling hiccups, its handling a ton of transactions and while other consensus methods like eos' dpos will allow for scaling, ethereum is the only blockchain with scaling solutions on the horizon that solves for the blockchain trilemma while also boasting the largest developer community by far.  

Crypto as a whole is toxic, with all of us shilling our bags or holdings (obviously I hold eth) but if you yourself can't see why ethereum is in the vanguard then at least ask yourself why more people who actually code and develop are getting behind ethereum then any other blockchain by far.  They acknowledge their scaling issues, they already have scaling solutions and more on the way.  All that said though we would go further as a community supporting each other than taking shots at one another...myself included.
"
">Agree with the sentiment, correction though: The Byzantine Generals problem is solved by PoW, not the blockchain.

I tend to disagree with that.

PoW has existed for a long time, predate bitcoin for at least ten years.

it is its implementation in a blockchain data structure that solve the bizantime general paradox.

The breakthrough was building a blockchain using PoW to reach consensus (whatever you use to measure consensus could do the job it doesn’t necessarily has to be PoW).

Actually no. Blockchain does equal Bitcoin (or other top currency like ETH).

Blockchain is useless without Bitcoin, so therefore Blockchain does kind-of equal Bitcoin. 

**There is no ""Blockchain"" without Bitcoin. ""Blockchain"" has become a stupid buzzword for the masses.**

^ This is what I am trying to argue here."
A reputation system sounds interesting indeed. 
"That's fair.  That statement comes from a number of comments from consensys members like Andrew keys citing an analyst study but to your point I don't have the hard evidence in front of me.

Im not sure I need it though, one can simply take a look at the current landscape and surmise that it's an accurate statement.  But I'll concede I don't have the analysts info in front of me and I'll support that perhaps things aren't always what they seem.  So I'll simply say this... regardless of your position on the usefulness of dapp releases or the framework/tools that have been coming out, in the last year developers on the  ethereum blockchain have been pumping out far more product or code for upcoming projects than any other blockchain.  If another blockchain has much more developer support they certainly haven't been releasing anything to prove it.  

 That said, I'll also offer up an apology, this popped up on my r/all feed and I made the assumption it was r/cryptocurrency not r/btc.  Unlike some people who support other blockchain I don't make it a point of coming into subs for competing chains and start spouting off about eth vs your investment...it plays right into my earlier comment about crypto being toxic.  I wouldn't have contributed if I had checked the sub, sorry if I ruffled feathers or kicked the hornets nest, I have a lot of respect for btc and the foundation it laid out."
"Not really from the perspective of what i was attempting to convey, but it was poorly worded.  The original comment was that they don't think ethereum understands what should and shouldnt be on their blockchain.  

While apple does review apps for their store to make sure they aren't malicious (as well as other awful practices like weeding out products that compete with their own), my point was more a case of apple isnt telling app developers what to create or what their app store should or shouldn't have.  So while the analogy might have missed the mark slightly due to their review process (one which doesn't currently exist on ethereum) apple isnt the one telling the developer community what the app store does or doesn't need.  

To simplify my point... Ethereum foundation aren't the ones making the  dapps (quality or shitty) or determining what should or shouldn't be on their blockchain (outside of their own dev teams working on Casper/scaling, etc)"
"pfff... ugh.  you are the one without a clue. just to let you know. Ive worked as a programmer for 20 years, and 15 of those handled enterprsie systems. \(just to respond to your retarded claim of havnig education in the field\).

First of all, POW is a way to handle multiple authors to the blockchain. Like POS also is. IF it were f.ex 1 author of the blockchain, it would ofc be immutable by design.  A blockchain would be a perfect addition to a traditional ledger in an accounting system for a company f.ex.

You are talking about decentralized handling of transactions using blockchain. Not just blockchain.

And putting up ""mysql"" or git as some form of alternative or something, makes absiolutely no sense in this regard.

Blockchain does not equal bitcoin

\(no I Wasnt lying about my work experience\)"
Ok, nothing I said was factually incorrect though. I'm sorry you feel that way
I think identity of people can be done, but it would have to be reputation based if it was decentralized. I agree it's kind of pointless to have a decentralized ID that still depends on the government. I see identities of people and things as being only useful so much as they provide added value, such as tracking or trust, but if your private keys are compromised then we need an easy way to discard the old ID and start over. People are not perfect and they make mistakes so we can have these IDs on blockchains, but if someone loses a key then it should be able to start over and start building a reputation / history on a new key. It might set you back, but it isn't the end of the world. I think that's what we need to understand about IDs on the blockchain, is that they represent a digital best-fit identity for whatever you're trying to do not necessarily who you are. They're tools for getting things done online, but the real world is the ultimate source of truth. People might even have multiple IDs to do multiple things online, like reddit accounts. If we take personal IDs on the blockchain too literally then they start to get in the way of life instead of enhance it. That's the idea of creating digital IDs for inanimate objects as well. The ID and history is nice, but if it's compromised then don't use it. It's only as useful as long as it's useful! I have a lot of ideas about human IDs as well, but we're starting with things because it's low risk. We're going to have an awesome system though very soon.
">ask yourself why more people who actually code and develop are getting behind ethereum then any other blockchain by far

Such a bold statement and not a shred of evidence to back it up. Everyone wants to believe their blockchain is attracting more developers ""by far"". I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're not necessarily correct either."
Apple decide what shouldn't be an app on their ecosys. And create their own ones regarding what they think should be an app. Think twice about this. 
"> It's an immutable ledger. 

Sorry, but you don't understand anything... It's not immutable at all. Not without PoW. When there is not enough difficulty & total work done, you can easily 51%-attack it permanently and make it mutable.

This is why blockchain without PoW makes no sense. Also making 1000 blockchains each with different PoW system does not make sense, because there is less total work in each blockchain so it is weaker and more prone to attacks / takeovers.

The only way blockchains make sense is with a single, global currency like Bitcoin Cash. This way there is the most accumulated difficulty and the blockchain is totally impractical to attack.

I am not even talking about PoS-based blockchains because they always end up centralized (thus being easily replaceble by a single MySQL database)

> lol... blockchain is not a relational database at all.

Well duh. 

Obviously it is not relational in the traditional sense. But blocks have a relation to each other because next block contains hash of previous block's data, also transactions in next blocks are **RELATED** to contents of previous blocks. This is why I said ""kind-of-relational"".

> Maybe you can explain how mysql would store transactions without the risk of tampering?

Well duh, again.

It's easy. Just store Hash of data of every record in another field. Also create multiple backups using replication. This way it is immutable.

"Identity of things, that's interesting. Will read the white paper soon. What I was referring to was in fact, unique identification of people. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't see how people can have an unique id, only one id for every user without introducing a ""trusted"" third party. Hopefully, some very smart people are working on this and will be solved soon. This, I believe will be one of the most useful, if not THE most useful use case of DLT."
Sounds more like corporate take over of a more security popular way to do transactions.
Yea but like impossible to use. Doing basic things like seeing how much Monero you have is freaking difficult, and straight up impossible for the technology challenged. You shouldn’t need a degree in IT to use a product. There’s a reason Coinbase is the biggest Exchange

Imagine that it’s a spaceship capable of light-speed travel. Along then comes Satoshi and his team, yet with all their wisdom, could only describe it as a modern day horse and wagon - which to his credit contains a basic description of how a horse and wagon works. So your statement is the equivalent of comparing the horse and wagon (blockchain) to your understanding of a motor car (sql, git). 

Let me ask you this, given basic raw production materials, what is easier to manufacture from scratch - a horse or a car?  There’s enough mathematics in that “horse” to bewilder the brightest of minds "

It's humorous, to say the least. All these ordinary people thinking they're gonna be Bill Gates or Elon Musk because they invested in, read, or heard about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology.

It takes years to develop that kind of thing, and in the end it might be clumsy and people always want to add their personal touch. That is why there are so many video codecs for example (a codec is not a protocol but it's still a data exchange format).

With a blockchain you don't have that kind of problem :the framework is there, you just have to use it. "
