These people aren‚Äôt allowed to withdraw their money out of the bank, except for small amounts over the next 6 months.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt about speculation. It is freedom to millions globally.Bitcoin is different things to different people.

Market making‚Ä¶Many large banks in India have seized the wealth of hard working Indian citizens recently.

These people aren‚Äôt allowed to withdraw their money out of the bank, except for small amounts over the next 6 months.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt about speculation. It is freedom to millions globally.Bitcoin is different things to different people.

Market making‚Ä¶Many large banks in India have seized the wealth of hard working Indian citizens recently.

These people aren‚Äôt allowed to withdraw their money out of the bank, except for small amounts over the next 6 months.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt about speculation. It is freedom to millions globally.Bitcoin is different things to different people.

When you‚Äôre worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin‚Äôs non-seizability becomes very attractive.
