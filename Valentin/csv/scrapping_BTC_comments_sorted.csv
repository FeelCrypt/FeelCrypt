2017-11-19;It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer. Remittance is a way of life.

There's only one thread to read through.  Before compiling your evidence, just read the one thread all the way through to make sure you didn't miss anything.

My guess on the whole ""attack"" was that it was a poorly programmed bot going wild.  Likely the bot was programmed to downvote comments 20 times an hour and the programmer missed a decimal place on a timer and it went wild with 200 votes a second.

2017-11-21;"This is merely scratching the surface. Any veteran programmer will tell you how easy it is to set up the code for bots. Just using a RNN, like say https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn can turn up enough semi-logical content to make some hard to automatically detect karma farming. And this isn’t even using anything remotely specialized. The fact is, if I could see myself be able to do this for fun (I am a veteran programmer), then for sure there’s team that are monetarily backed that have done the legwork already. Not that there’s that much to do. You can easily set up some pre-written conversation topics with some minor variations, code some fuzzy search and have bots automatically respond with your propaganda. You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do. So yeah, expect this problem to become exponentially worse."

2017-11-21;"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

2017-11-21;"Wow this is huge. I'm surprised /r/bitcoin mods were so sloppy that you were able to uncover that they were doing the vote botting, which means they were involved with the hacking (I wonder if they actually did the hacking too!). What's more crazy is the connection to /u/nullc which shows clearly that Blockstream and /r/bitcoin mods have been working together to manipulate the entire market! I'm dumbfounded. I would be really surprised if we don't see reddit admins take some action here against the mods and user accounts involved in this.

Regarding /u/nullc, besides his comment being targetted by the bot, the ""sockpuppet"" of his could just be one of his many fans who imitate his writing style and talking points, and yes even sometimes have his back in comment threads. Unless either of the accounts start deleting comments there will be more room to analyze writing styles to see if it's just a fan or an actual sockpuppet."
2017-11-22;"Alright, I'll take a moment to look this over, if only to separate facts from speculation.

Here we go.

>When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( Image of #1, link to #2 ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating. 

Actually, both /u/4n4n4 and /u/StopAndDecrypt have been approved submitters to /r/Bitcoin for 5 months or more. So no, neither comment needed to be manually approved by the moderators, and in fact, as a moderator of /r/Bitcoin, I can say for a fact that **neither comment was manually approved by a moderator of /r/Bitcoin**. This is a fact. 

So right there, your ""smoking gun"" (and your chief hypothesis) is out the window. Let's continue.

>The bots which were downvoting comments and posts on /r/Bitcoin and upvoting posts on /r/btc began their attack on 11/14/2017 at around 18:00 utc. A similar unusual pattern of voting appeared on /r/btc around the same time the day before, though less dramatically. The bots seemed to be pushing people to buy Bitcoin Cash in such a blatant way that it even left a bad taste in the mouths of Bitcoin Cash supporters. Both the attack the day before and the /r/Bitcoin bot voting attack on 11/14/2017 ended before or around 22:00 utc [REF-3]. The bots attacking /r/Bitcoin upvoted posts complaining about high fees and downvoted about 30 other /r/Bitcoin posts. At the same time they upvoted posts on /r/btc. We identified 65 comments downvoted by bots in /r/Bitcoin and 2 upvoted. The conclusions appeared to indicate that the bots were promoting Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and harming /r/Bitcoin.

This is all true.

>We began investigating into the comments that caught our eye at first, referred to as [CU-1] and [CU-2] for short. [CU-1]'s content can be seen here as it originally looked. Immediately we noticed the next oddity - How were people able to see votes in /r/Bitcoin to discuss voting in the first place? /r/Bitcoin has blocked votes from being visible on comments during discussion for years. When did that change? We found that it changed right before [CU-1] was posted. BashCo stickied a comment stating they would ""pull back the curtains"" at 20:49, and archive.org confirmed that scores became visible between 20:32 utc and 20:50 utc. That, oddly enough, was just 13 minutes before [CU-1] was posted at 21:02:25.

So, to make sure the facts are straight here... the timeline here is that [this post](http://i.imgur.com/xrM39eb.png) was made, it was upvoted massively by a malicious bot army, [BashCo started a thread about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/) to call attention to it (and as you noted, [he temporarily enabled transparent vote-scores to highlight the attack](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptn609/)), and the attack continued from there. Then darwin2500 chimed in *to make fun of BashCo for pointing out the attack*, and was immediately upvoted massively (by the same malicious bot army, it would seem). It was approved by StopAndDecrypt a couple of minutes later (almost certainly because he was replying to the comment, and it was *yet another example of vote manipulation* that served to highlight what was being done and reinforce BashCo's valid points), and later deleted by darwin2500, the original submitter of the comment.

I don't see what you mean by ""oddly enough"", considering the entire episode was about *an ongoing vote manipulation campaign* that BashCo and StopAndDecrypt were calling attention to. In other words, none of the above seems to indicate *any* sort of foul play from *any* moderators of /r/Bitcoin *whatsoever*, but it seems like you are trying to imply that it does.

>We have determined that [CU-1] was indeed blocked by /r/Bitcoin's automoderator rules as we expected. The screenshot taken by /r/Bitcoin moderator StopAndDecrypt clearly shows this, as the ""moderator approved"" checkmark is present. We also tested automoderator rules with an aged account with karma and confirmed that ""censors"" and ""censoring"" were both blocked [REF-1]. Note that the poster, darwin2500 (under control of hacker, please don't ping them; they aren't a Bitcoiner) could not have been an ""approved submitter"" - they seem to have only had one comment in /r/Bitcoin before the hacking.

So you are aware of the ""approved submitter"" possibilities, and failed to even *mention* the possibility that either StopAndDecrypt or 4n4n4 were approved submitters in your very first paragraph when you said: ""Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.""? That in itself is rather telling.

Readers, I urge you to re-read my previous paragraph until you understand the point I am making very clearly. OP is *very* deliberately trying to ""spin a narrative"" here, not mentioning the possibility of certain comments being visible because they were made by approved submitters (which I can tell you for a fact is the truth) and instead pretending like the **only** possible explanation for the comment(s) being visible was that they were manually approved by /r/Bitcoin moderators (they were not), *even though they obviously know about approved submitters on reddit and discuss this later on in their post*.

>So why was the comment manually approved? 

As I said above, /u/StopAndDecrypt *was replying to the comment in question*, and was obviously *trying to highlight the vote manipulation that was going on*. You can't very well reply to a comment that isn't visible, and it is completely obvious why this comment was approved, when you look at the context it was made in and what was going on.

>We are not aware of any other approved or allowed comments that blatantly reference censorship like that in the last several months. 

There are **many**, but admitting this doesn't help the narrative that you are trying to spin. I remembered (off the top of my head) an instance from just a few days ago, and [dug it up for you as an example](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dks5y/cut_the_bullshit/dpyif6k/).

So once again, this is more evidence that you're presenting information *incredibly* disingenuously. Comments that reference the alleged ""censorship"" of /r/Bitcoin are allowed all the time, even on a daily basis, despite the fact that they are off-topic and usually made by troll-armies just to stir up drama and mislead newcomers.

>Except this idea did not hold up. We found 10 similar comments from the same time period which were not approved or were explicitly removed unlike [CU-1]. Some of these were uncannily similar to the original comment. For example this one was submitted 8 minutes after [CU-1] and never approved. Another here supported neither subreddit and was blocked at 21:48 and never approved. This one accused /r/Bitcoin mods of being paid by Blockstream and was manually removed at ~22:35. A fourth was identical to [CU-2] and blocked at 00:12 and never approved. The same account of [CU-1] submitted a second comment 5 minutes after [CU-1] and was blocked and not approved. The other 5 things blocked or removed around the same time were: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The existence or absence of most of these comments around the claimed time can be verified independently of the censorship_notifier, see [REF-2]

What on earth? How does this paragraph *in any way* indicate that ""this idea does not hold up""? 

Your argument in this paragraph seems to be: ""If you allow/approve *one comment* that is discussing 'censorship' in the subreddit (to highlight the vote brigading going on, then *you must also allow every single malicious comment made by every troll in the same thread!*"" 

How does that make any sense? The point of the thread was to point out how obviously vote-brigaded things were being, and how the discussion was being manipulated. Letting one or two example comments demonstrate the point is sane. **Letting the entire thread be overrun by trolls would not be!** 

The argument in this paragraph makes no sense! You say ""this idea did not hold up"" but it holds up perfectly. "
2017-11-22;"The content of this post is excellent, and the amount of evidence is just staggering. However, doesn't anyone find the number of upvotes weird? I haven't seen any post with 1k upvotes on /btc, ever. We're now closer in at 8k.

Could it be that the mods knew the pattern of the bot from experience, so picking the correct comment was trivial?

For example if your subreddit gets vote manupilated every day you start to understand what type of comments it happens to. Then you configure auto moderator to remove these comments and require manual approval. But then to show the manipulation you can just approve one, and voila the bots get to work.

So its sort of like having a lake full of piranhas, you know they are there but dont see them until you throw some meat into and it becomes a huge frenzy. "

We'll spend several years cycling through this process of a previously promising currency being destroyed from within only for another currency to pop up reverting to the original specifications of bitcoin which becomes widely adopted. Eventually investors and everyday people have own various worthless cryptos demand government regulation on cryptocurrency and we'll eventually end up with a state sponsored ""bitdollar"" that is not finite but rather is a digital implementation of modern Fiat currency which people willingly adopt for it's convenience and security. Maybe this move undercuts the current banking system by allowing people to borrow directly from the central bank at the current interest rate and making things like private home loans obsolete.

We'll end up with some weird combination of unregulated Bitcoin and the federally backed US Dollar in a way that the average person won't really know the difference. I guess at least that's still somewhat of an improvement from what we have today."

2017-12-06;">BitPay is also planning on adding additional blockchains to their repertoire. By next year, Pair says they will natively support 4-5 additional blockchains, determining which ones by their ability to enable payments and by market cap size. They plan to add their first new cryptocurrency in the next two months. This will help consumers who are moving towards other cryptocurrencies in order to avoid bitcoin’s current high transaction fees.

2017-12-07;"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
> 
> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.

> We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.

I know you don't take sides and I know this was probably mostly if not entirely a business decision. But I still wanted to thank you for enabling buying and trading of Bitcoin Cash, and for doing it way earlier than most people even speculated. That is awesome! I look forward to telling people they no longer have to transfer their slow and expensive BTC from Coinbase to buy BCH. Now I will just tell them to buy it directly on coinbase! Ignore the onslaught of trolling you will get for this. They are a vocal minority. The fact is, bitcoin is unusable. It is a clown-show and everyday it becomes more and more obvious. Bitcoin Cash was the obvious next coin to add for a number of reasons. Thank you!"

2017-12-20;Even though I bought my first bitcoin in June, I fell in love with bitcoin and its altruistic motive. Unfortunately I soon realized BTC was not what i had bought into but held out in hopes we would move towards what it once was. No problem, if it doesn’t at least I have BCH.

2017-12-20;"I'm so angry right now. I got paid today. I want to buy BCH and ride the wave. I see it on coinbase, and every minute it's value is rising, Yet coinbase won't let me purchase it because purchases are ""temporarily disabled"" And yes I know technically I could join another exchange but I just really like the convenience of coinbase. The other exchanges want way more identity documents and I just haven't had the time for that."
2017-12-20;"Which trading system should i use if i am from EU and want one that doesnt use tethers? I really like the graph on bittrex(bars updated live, not just a line like on coinbase and bitstamp). GDAX says trading is unavailable in my region. Or maybe i should trust tethers and stay on bittrex?
"
2017-12-20;A word of advice. Because of the selloff of stashed BCH in coinbase, the price will most likely drop to about 35-3600 before arbitrage from other exchanges and pumpers buying the dip. Therefore it's wise to probably set up a limit order at about 3600 and watch closely to increase your bid if the plateau comes before then. 
2017-12-20;Just lovely.  Sitting on 4 confirmations, about 90 minutes into my transfer to GDAX.  Thought I was fine when it hit 4 about 30 minutes ago.

Is it wrong to think that increasing block size is good but if we do it before we have much higher segwit adoption then sites like Coin base, GDAX and wallets like Mycelium will never invest the resources needed to upgrade to Segwit?

As it stands the pressure is on the big applications to adopt segwit but raise the blocksize now and then they will wait years and hold up Mimble Wimble, Bullet Proofs, and Zsnarks and of course Lightening and all the other awesome stuff segwit allows.

Its not that Im against a bigger block... But of we do it now then the pressure is off for the big guys to adopt segwit.

Like Local Bitcoins just announced its using Segwit... That will get us above 10% soon... One good mobile wallet and coin base and bang we got enough to increase block size"
2018-01-07;Don’t ask BTC to raise blk size.  Large blk size is now with bitcoin cash. Period.  We should see the small blocksize experiment run to its conclusion.  Maybe they will be right maybe not. Time will tell.  BTC having a small blk size is good for big blockers for many reasons besides the size. Bch also has a less toxic environment, no censored forums, no brilliant-jerk developers.  If BTC raises block size it will really dampen bch progress and we will be stuck with a toxic censored community that is BTC.

2018-01-07;"What no one seems to point out, is that increasing the blocksize would actually _increase_ 'decentralization', to a point .... so even if 'decentralization' were the single overridingly most important factor in all of this, the argument is _still_ soo weak.

You've two curves interacting - one is what percentage of users a blocksize increase would put running a full node out of reach for (given their hardware), and the other is the overall usage+userbase increase of a blocksize increase and the corresponding expected increase in users running full nodes. 

At the current blocksize, an increase of say 4x would quickly 4x the amount of usage, and correspondingly something around 4x the number of users and thus a big increase in the number of users likely to be running nodes. At the same time, because we're talking pretty low hardware requirements still, it would only reduce the percentage of those able to run a full node by a tiny single digit percentage, leading to a huge overall gain in 'decentralization'. Obviously at some point (of further blocksize increasing() the equation would start to go in the other direction, but that's at a _much_ higher blocksize.

Can someone explain what is going on like I'm 5 years old with btc and what is/would be best for me to do with what I have invested in it?

I currently have coinbase, most of my money is invested in btc but I don't have a full btc. I'm essentially using it to grow enough that I can pay off some debt (and when I can, invest enough that I can have a decent backup savings!) crypto has been a wild ride trying to understand for me and i would appreciate some help, at least knowing where you guys get correct information from any good sites.

Thanks!"
2018-01-07;"Okay, let's see if I understand what's been going on.  
  
A block is a list of transactions. When you make a transaction you peg an additional fee on to it that goes to whoever mines the block with that transaction. By paying a larger fee you're more likely to have your block mined first. As bitcoin's userbase grew there was less block space to go around so fees went up so you're block would be more likely to be mined. If bitcoin increased their blocksize there'd be space for more transactions per block, causing fees to dip.  
  
Am I understanding this correctly? "

Even the devs don't know for a fact what would happen if there was a consensus for a block size increase. We don't know how people react to that kind of change in a network that actually has scale.

In the end, all of this is a thought experiment. We had the last hard-fork in August, we can't keep forking at the flip of a switch. That's not how consensus works and that makes any of those considerations (and this entire stupid war of communities) a simple thought-experiment.

2018-01-08;"This is why I moved to altcoins. People are coming up with lots of new original ideas that are much better without just being yet another hard fork of Bitcoin.

Look at RaiBlocks, for example. They can handle 7,000 transactions a second and everything is for free! I think people who are deep into all the first generation of coins, including all variations of bitcoins need to do some research on the new stuff that's out there and reconsider.

2018-01-08;"This whole situation just makes me sad. Sad that crypto currency won't end up facing the fight of its life from governments trying to shut it down but will slowly ebb away and die from self inflicted wounds.

I was a late adopter in late 2011 and to me, actually using bitcoin was more important than HODLing as a store of (potential value). I could buy and sell and transfer in seconds for practically no fee whatsoever.

I can't imagine how new adopters can wrap their heads around what is going on and although I don't have or hold any BCH just legacy, I'm starting to wonder whether the teams that work with legacy infrastructure have bitcoins best interest in mind.

It needs to be simplified and the power needs to be given back to the people,  not a bunch of miners and Dev's essentially holding progress hostage.

It really is sad. Like actual tears sad. It's hard to know what to believe when the well meaning and knowledgeable folks are mixed in with scammers, fear mongers and shills (on all sides)"

Thank you, I'm definitely going to do some homework on crypto."
2018-01-15;coinbase are digging information from your account details and doing lord knows what with it. I would recommend something other than coinbase. They sent me a message to my main crypto email with the name of the other person on my joint bank account rather than using my name. that shows that they are digging information from our accounts don't know why they are doing it but they are. just a heads up and wanting to spread the information. Really wish I hadn't gotten into crypto at this point.
