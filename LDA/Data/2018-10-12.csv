The article even has a tldr- skip to the last sentences."
"Yep. Absolutely. Now what code has Adam Back written for core?
What position does Vladimir hold at blockstream?

How bad are you at venn diagrams?"
Blockstream veto, you really crack me up.
So do many other developers. But I suppose they don't count.
correct
Did you find a mirror?
Block size was always one of the plans. Even satoshi talked about channels and sidechains and what we today call layer 2. I also believe that blocksize will have to increase. And once we reach the capacity of LNs, segwit, batched transactions, MAST, schnorr and friends it is time to do just that.
Silly you, I'm a married man with young kids, I don't get to fuck anything.
"Aggressive anti-ideology easily becomes a blinding factor as well. This sub is just as much of an echo chamber. Heck people constantly get upvoted while sprouting ""facts"" about LN that just one Google search would show is completely false.

It's okay to be critical but it's also easy to slide into fanaticism. Everyone who disagree with anything here is automatically labeled a shill and a large percentage of the anti-bitcoin posts are pure strawmanship."

I fully expect bitcoin to be superseded by gen 3 or 4 cryptocurrencies in due time. If it doesn't hardfork into such a currency in itself.
Seems to be going really well. I mean you're not spending any time bashing Bitcoin.
"Yeah well I don't see any bch miners raking in millions in fees either.

Now at what point do you expect bitcoin to catastrophically fail without notice? I'd like to set up some shorts."
Nah, milord Jess is pathological in his use of word games and silly rethorical devices in his relentless defense of the purity of this sub. He never once try to understand your point he's just looking for small bits to use as ammunition. Having to constantly defend positions you didn't actually take is tiring. So I stopped. I'm not going to dress up as his strawmen.
"no they are not. They are paid workers. Sure if they hold they are stakeholders but many don't. 

Miners absolutely are an evil necessity. We have no better way of preventing fraud than proof of work. But proof of work is wasteful."
Yeah that's why I'm super stoked about mimblewimble.
"There is absolutely a reason for the 1mb cap. There was a reason when satoshi set it and there's a reason today.

Just because you don't agree with the reasoning doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

BCH is almost completely unproven when it comes to handle large amounts of transactions over large periods of time. There are several other currencies, like the mimblewimble stuff, that could easily outpace every theoretical advantage that bch could ever have. So if transaction speed and cost was really important to you then why are you not over there?"
We already established you think blocksize increases are the way to go and you have your own chain for that. For the rest of us who think 2nd layers are required theres bitcoin.
it won't be bch, that is 100%
I posted negatively on the first Liquid post on r/BTC. Didn't get banned. I was actually the first posters I think.
Not really. But it depends on how it's used. If they try to get listed on an exchange or something it might be an issue but since it's supposed to be a 1:1 lock to bitcoin on chain I don't see the point.
"I haven't written a single line of bitcoin code. I haven't worked for shit. I don't begrudge people the right to make a profit though, do you? Are you a communist? 

What is this crippling that you keep going on about. Can you show me some code?"
">  ... isn't breaking the chain.  

It is per the Bitcoin white paper if it gets added without Nakamoto Consensus, like it has on ""BTC"". It's also not possible in a true soft fork."
Yeah a global usage blockchain can't work conceptually either.
I'm quite sure that the limits aren't set at 90% of complete meltdown on any real world API. As for the bitcoin protocol it has just gotten a capacity upgrade so I feel it would be best to let that pan out a bit before beginning the process of hard forking the entire system.
"Because he presented no facts. You need to back up your claims not just state your opinions as facts. If people start sprouting bullshit facts I tend to respond with nonsensical arguments because it's exhausting to have to have to correct every stupid little mistake.

If someone wants to have a reasonable discussion I'm mostly up for it though."
This is a free uncensored forum. Asking people to fuck off kinda goes against the spirit.
You mean Adam Back president-individial-president of blockstream? Who flew to China to convince the miners not to run any other bitcoin software than bitcoin core, in return for an empty, fake promise of increasing the block size limit?
You think they are going to bite the hand that feeds? You really crack me up. 
Sure, and if those developers were building subscription based products which benefit from restricted transactions on the main Bitcoin chain they'd hopefully get called out on it too.
Why not raise it then?
"Dude you literally just said implementing Segwit - which was practically a rewrite of the entire codebase - and *moving the payment layer to an entirely different network* which is still in the ""figuring out out"" phase was ""not changing the system"" and being ""conservative.""

O_o"
Him talking about 2nd layer solutions has NOTHING to do with having a block size limit.
"That's probable but there are many facts about the lightning network which aren't false and their plans for the network come straight from their own blog posts.

I think it's naive if you assume there aren't crypto shills given all that's at stake financially. It would be like going into r\politics and assuming you're having an impartial discussion with peers when it's common knowledge both sides are paying people to go online to forums like that and comment.

That being said, calling someone a shill and not debating their argument on its merit is certainly a weak defense"

We work on adoption with the real Bitcoin that is not limited on the useful applications that can be built on it and more are getting out every day. BTC have nothing left than Blockstream and long maxed out 1 mb blocks. You must be proud.
Nah he's just calling you out on your self defeating arguments.
Empty blocks /= full blocks you retarded shill. 
Miners have a capital investment in equipment.  All schools of economics consider the people owning and operating mining equipment and associated infrastructure as businessmen, capitalists and/or entrepreneurs. They are not workers.  
You are supporting layer 2 at the expense of layer 1.  No thanks.
And that reasoning is!?!? You have no idea.  Anyway here's Satoshi himself's words on the initial block size choice in 2010: “We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.”
"Bitcoin is an economic system built using a structure of economic incentives.

In April 2010 bitcoin literally had zero value, so its system of incentives could not function yet, the 1mb limit was added to protect this non-functioning system against people fucking with it at will.

Now that Bitcoin has a non-zero value, to put it fucking mildly, the system can work as intended, which it did until BlockstreamCore took over and crippled it by abusing the long redundant cap."
There was a good reason for Satoshi to set a temporary cap. It was never supposed to be permanent. There is no good reason for the cap now. Or I don't know, I guess according to you the cap is totally justified so a few hundred enthusiasts can run a rPi node that does absolutely nothing for the network and will crash anyway when mempool grows too large. It is such a good reason that it's totally cool that because of it people have to pay $100 fees to transfer their coins.. 
"If you think that, it’s cool, I don’t agree because these aren’t facts, just magical thinking. But different from what you are saying, BTC unusable is a fact. It will fail? It failed as a payment system already. If it success to whatever it want to success it probably be as a speculative asset or a banking system 2.0. No dream of a true decentralized financial system.

Good for you? I don’t think so! "
"> Are you a communist?

Having a single entity making a profit is pretty much what communism is. And you people  had to kill the entire ecosystem to achieve that. Congrats!

Hey now, language!
I'm of to Google then. Have a nice day.
"How is bch doing these magical feats? It has a fraction of the the miners, a fraction of the users and a fraction of the volume not to mention price.

I just don't see bch doing anything except trying to fling shit at Bitcoin.

If bch had been successful we wouldn't have had this discussion because the ecosystem, the hash rate and I would have followed."
Yes
Paid workers are still citizens of the ecosystem.  There is no such thing as an evil necessity.  If you need something 'evil' in order for your ecosystem to function, then you did it wrong in the first place.
You can't talk your way out of intentionally crippling the blockchain instead of letting the Bitcoin internal market decide on an appropriate blocksitze. Instead, you managed to turn it into let the market decide between intentionally crippled Bitcoin and anything else. Which is an extremely stupid way to frame the issue, one in which everybody loses. Loss/Loss/Loss solutions are retarded.
"You can argue that a better coin might come out and dethrone Bitcoin Cash, but

>The math is quite clear that a blockchain can't handle global scale transactions.

Math is actually showing the opposite, see gigablocks.... "
If BCH hits this scaling wall it means only one thing: it already won the adoption race.
"Such a convulated mess off side chains requiring extra trust and complexity when a simple block size limit increase would have sufficed.

There's no evidence that the increase would have been detrimental like some say, merely speculation. But these half working complex systems are somehow a better solution. "
It doesn’t matter if bitcoin cash dumps now, a coin that actually works will overtake and hopefully that will be BCH. Bitcoin is a non sense Ponzi scheme at this point because they destroyed its practical use. 
You are completely full of shit. There are plenty of threads over there about liquid right now. Which highlights the inconsistency in their moderation rules. So get over there, prove you’re not a dishonest troll, and post this article. You know what’s going to happen. Don’t play it off like you “just follow the rules”.
Would you then say that it's a scam since they call it Liquid BTC or LBTC? Isn't that very misleading?
But aren't you happy? This is the culmination of your years of free hard work to cripple the main chain so Blockstream can make a profit.
I'm only responding. This particular thread is started by me and I haven't exactly been talking a lot outside of it. Feel free to tag me however you want.
"I know that in your quest for adversaries you want Blockstream to be core but that doesn't make it so.

Rearranging a block to put some witness data for some transactions outside the data structure used as a txid isn't breaking the chain. "
"It's the peg that makes it a sidechain not the way it handles blocks and transactions.

liquid absolutely is a layer 2 system. It uses a two way peg to the bitcoin chain that's trustless in and uses a federated trust out. It's a completely moronic system that only a fool would trust but it's still a layer 2  system.

True two way pegging is not possible on bitcoin, not yet anyway. I'm not sure if theres any work being done to do something about that either on bch or btc. "
"1mb == 1mb

This does not change just because you are upset."
Either bitcoin gets superseded by a next gen cryptocurrency or the bch codebase hits the wall of lightspeed communication and bandwidth like a fully loaded train hitting a mountain. The math is quite clear that a blockchain can't handle global scale transactions.
Reading comprehension much?
"True, but NPC has been a popular cultural term since the early days of WOW and probably even before then. Yet you never saw anyone calling each other NPCs on popular discussion forums. So I will agree that it is no longer centrally coordinated, but clearly some small group of people (cough, Russian political disinformation bots, cough) started the recent trend of labeling any kind of negative feedback as coming from an ""NPC"". 

What I don't understand is why regular people are taking to what is and was a disinformation tactic. In the same vein, most regular people don't go around calling everything fake news - that's left to a certain rogue group of hired and brainwashed people."
"It isn't done to optimize their own software, it's done to force others to optimize theirs.

It's very common for protocols to have arbitrary limits to ensure that implementations don't use to many resources. More or less every API in existence has limits on request rates and data sizes."
So will you change your mind if lightning leaves beta and begins to work? Because I kinda think you will move your goalposts in order to always have something to argue against.
"Yes, of course. **All the decisions**. Must be tiring.

Could you provide links? I mean it's all public over there at the repository."
No it doesn't.
"Those examples are products that those corporations have built and later open sourced. Those companies still hold copyrights and other rights to the product.

Blockstream did not write bitcoin. It isn't even a custodian/maintainer of bitcoin. "
Not changing a system is not crippling a system. Not changing a system is being conservative. Linus had complete freedom to do whatever he wanted to Linuxwise. Core devs who work for blockstream have the same deal.
Ideology is important.
"Yes I was alive less than a year ago. I also had plenty of transactions go through during that whole debacle. It didn't ruin bitcoin though. I

n some ways the unfortunate slowdown might have prevented an even bigger meltdown. 

Hopefully next time the better usage of batching and segwit will keep things more manageable."
They can also avoid the hassle by using any other cryptocurrency. Although it really isn't a hassle. 1sat/bit are low priority transactions. If you're in a hurry you pay more as per the protocol laid down by satoshi.
Yeah that's going to be a really big issue around 2100. I don't think I'll be around to experience it though.
Oh bother, it's the High Lord Misinterpreter, cheif Justice and defender of the FUD. Quick, hide!
Same
You can have it.
Good points... I won't be surprised if Blockstream will start a major ban sween in r/Bitcoin soon to eliminate all the concerned opposition given how they clearly neglected the LN. Their goal is almost accomplished anyway, and even if the remaining BTC supporters can't accept their excuses anymore, as BTC holders they are essentially Blockstream stock holders at this point and will keep defending BS.
When Bitcoin (BTC) has high fees it's because its transaction volume has been artificially capped ridiculously low. There is no rational defence for the 1 MB blocksize cap. It's only there to cripple the base layer. When Bitcoin (BTC) has low fees, like right now, it's because nobody is using it. People just HODL and think that it will moon to MUH ONE MILLION. Bitcoin (BCH) has pretty low volume right now because nobody is using it either. However, Bitcoin (BCH) can handle very large volume without any problems thanks to scaling on-chain. Fees will not rise because there will always be space in those big beautiful blocks..
They have control dumb ass they update the most popular client of bitcoin. Miners are greedy so they keep using whatever they think they need. When BTC fails, they’ll move somewhere else. 
"""Nothing"" as in they set a completely idiotic tech roadmap for the entire chain that guarantees their position at the center of it charging tolls on the routes? 

Right, you're a lost cause, I'm done even bothering with you. Fuck off.

">Much force.  Wow.  Such influence. 

That’s your response?  One of the smartest guys in here just showered you with verifiable facts, and all you have are some retarded Doge references? 

Why don’t you engage his statements and with facts to prove why hes wrong? 

At least then we can respect you for being intellectually honest, rather than just here to jerk off to your own snarky comments to people you consider idiots.

You make a huge stink about corporate influence over BCH, yet you ignore the plank in your own eye. Blockstream literally buying off the top Bitcoin developers who, yes, control the keys to the repository and make final decisions on what gets through. 

You dismiss that and  “Pooh Pooh” it like it’s irrelevant. But you get bent out of shape over Roger who has been championing the same Bitcoin since 2010. And Bitmain who is **expected** to vie for the implementation of bitcoin that ensures miners get paid for their work.  Which is exactly how bitcoin was written. 

But you’ve got people who are changing bitcoin into something that makes them rich, and pays back $151 million of investors who somehow wanted them to monetize a free decentralized network. And you’ve got no problem with that. No corporate corruption there. You’ve got to be kidding me."
"(have you made any friends by using the term ""regular people?"" Just curious.)

Npc = someone with no (real) skin in the game. It works for paid socks & shills. I like it.

But yeah it's weird how it suddenly sprang up in this new usage."
">  More or less every API in existence has limits on request rates and data sizes.

All APIs that I know of set their limits just under the point at which their system falls apart. For instance, if 100 requests/second will crash their server, they set the limit to 90. No sane company that has an API will limit it to 1 request/sec if they can handle 100... The core morons want to keep the limit orders of magnitude lower than what the computers running the network can maximally handle, and it's hurting the protocol."
"You realize LN is eternally ""out of beta"" in 6 months since 3 years. But even if that wasn't the case, LN can't work, conceptually."
Blockstream was formed by the lead developers of bitcoin core. They are 1 and the same.
Yes it does, no matter how hard you don't want it to be true.
Their developers do however have a big influence on what does (or, more importantly in this case, does not) get included in Bitcoin Core - the most widely used Bitcoin client.
Blocksize was always intended to be raised.

"No dummy. The whole point is we want a fully functional and robust base layer as well as a layer 2. Not sure why you’re not getting this.  

You’re in here trolling everyone. You’re not listening to anything anybody says. You’re just trying to come up with snarky shit to say in response. Which is why all of your responses are getting down voted.  

Here’s the reality: BCH will have layer one and layer 2. BTC won’t. At least not for a long ass time because liquid has to pay back $151 million worth of investments first. 

And you can’t make money off layer two if layer one works just fine for free. That’s the entire premise of our complaint.

Please ask yourself why they refuse to address the concerns of $50 transaction fees and weeklong transaction times? Do you think that’s not going to come back over night in the next 12 months when the bear market starts to fade away? 

This is when you’re going to see BTC facing it’s biggest reputation crisis. Because this shit is coming back as soon as usage picks up.

BCH is doing what BTC was supposed to do. Why can’t you see that?"
Increasing the block size was always the plan for scaling the system. The block size limit was a temporary measure to fight spam for a time when blocks had barely any transactions in them. Keeping it after blocks became full was indeed crippling the system.
"No it's not. It makes people blind to obvious truths and bend every fact to fit their existing worldview.

Having an open mind is important. Otherwise you get people evil people saying the ends justify their means.

"> I also had plenty of transactions go through during that whole debacle. It didn't ruin bitcoin though

No one said transactions were not going through, so that's a deflection.

"Well, if ""longest chain rules"" then spv is obviously quite secure and there's no need to independently validate.

If you independently validate, then you don't believe ""longest chain rules."""
Without miners, there is no Bitcoin.  They are part of the ecosystem.  The Core mantra seems to be that miners are some kind of evil necessity.  They are part of the overall ecosystem, and are indeed citizens of Bitcoin.  
"It had high fees because it's design* was crap.  It now has low fees because everyone recognizes that.

*Just the 1MB part.  The rest is mostly elegance."
"> But for some magical reason these things don't apply to, say, bch

Correct.  Bitcoin-BCH has scaled by increasing the block size, so it will not have capacity issues (high fees or unreliable transactions) when usage increases.  This was always the intention of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash.  You have decided to back a version of Bitcoin that is/will be inaccessible to most people when high fees return (they _will_ return unless Bitcoin-BTC stagnates and dies).  It’s not what I or most early supporters signed up for.

I’m here to participate in building new foundational monetary system for the world.  A high fee settlement system that recreates / reinforces rent seeking of the banking industry isn’t it for me, but to each their own.  Fortunately we can each back the coins of our choosing and the market is the cumulative consensus.  Unfortunately we’d be a lot of effective if we were unified."
Keep fucking that chicken.
"I don't owe miners shit. Miners are not the point of bitcoin. If miners has to turn of some mining power it doesn't bother me for a second.

Mining as a system was built to be self regulating. If profits go down, so do hashrate. Hashrate will always have price parity with coin value. This also means that attacking the bitcoin chain will almost always cost a lot more than you get out of it.

Miners are not a political force. Miners are not citizens of bitcoin. Miners are workers that are paid for their work. If they don't want out coin they are free to fuck the hell off."

You failed to answer how the cap is justified now and who benefited from it last December..
"Today you use anything and it works the volume of transactions is low and there’s no activity. Your focus should be Tomorrow not today. The next time BTC has big amount of transactions it will colapse just like last time because the problem was never fixed.

Where else would I be? This is entertaining.
"That's just the point. No one here is ever presenting evidence. It's just well masticised propaganda that's almost always based on a flawed understanding of the system you are attacking.

"Yeah and you should read up on the proponents of bch.

Let's do both and meet back here in a year or two. Try to find some unbiased sources, though, not forum posts."
You are free to argue. If the ecosystem disagree the ecosystem will change.
"If bch could sustain say 20mb blocks for a year then perhaps that would be enough. The bug in core didn't cause a hard fork since the bug was in one implementation not in the protocol. Core may be the largest client but isn't the only one. If a core client had accepted an invalid block it would have forked itself off the chain.

Bug fixes and hard forks might look similar to a novice but they aren't really. And since the bug was never exploited on the mainnet there never was any chain split nor any forking."
I can find no previous examples of that statement could you please show me where I've copied this from?
"If 50%+ of miners on any cryptocurrency descides to change any rule they can. This is a weakness of all mined cryptos. Heck with 51% of the mining capacity of bitcoin I could force bch to enable segwit if I wanted to.

I can't say it's something that keeps me up at night."
"The justification is the same as it's always been.

Making sure that block usage is optimized and keeping the blockchain from ballooning."
But they use the same protocol.
And yet it will come again.
Treating miners as political stake holders is like letting the police make the laws. It's not viable.
No. Police are a function not a political entity in a well working system. When police and military goes political you get shithole countries.
"If millions of people started to actually use bitcoin then the blocks would absolutely need to be bigger.

That doesn't mean that segwit and LN doesn't help. Every smidge of optimization we add now means that every byte we add to the blocklimit later is that much more effective."
You think morality comes from law? You must be a child.
Both as police and as citizens.  Both roles are important in the decision making process.
I better order that book from Amazon now because in two hours USA wakes up and the fees will increase a few orders of magnitude? Is that what you mean by usage optimization? If millions of people started to actually use Bitcoin (BTC) SegShit wouldn't help shit.

"Laudable?

Right. I feel our moral compasses are too misaligned to continue this. Have a nice day."
Yes but not as police. I respect miners who hold and use Bitcoin as Bitcoin users, not as miners.
"I've paid for many things with Bitcoin, heck I even bought part of my home for Bitcoin.

When block space is at a premium it forces heavy users to use the available tools to optimize their usage. Segwit usage is growing, multi-transactions are regularly used by exchanges and so on."
It's easy. Segwit is backwards compatible.
"there you go again, ""once there is"" ...you are beaten by facts in this conversation...come back ""once there is"" a problem again with the bitcoin...and december just means that bitcoin fended off an attempted attack by the bch shilling miner groip...failed miserably...no wonder you are so bitter..."
That's more an indictment of them than Ver, if you know anything about the situation. In fact given what I know about it, those things are laudable for Ver. 
Very good analogy.  
Police shouldn't make the laws.  But they should have some say in the process, as members of the community.
Actually, no.  TDMA and CDMA are different protocols.
The ridiculously low cap is the opposite of optimization. Don't you understand what happens when blocks get full? Then the people who want to transfer their coins have to start competing with each other, paying higher and higher fees to get their transactions through. The ridiculously low cap discourages actual usage of Bitcoin (BTC). Or I guess you don't want for Bitcoin (BTC) to work as actual P2P electronic cash? Is that what you mean when you say that the cap optimizes block usage and keeps the blockchain from ballooning? God help if people actually wanted to use Bitcoin (BTC) to pay for things and stuff..
"No, in the present day it doesn’t work well because once there’s just a small amount of too much transactions it will colapse. That’s today’s tech. Not yesterday or future. Get your facts straight. December is proof of that and it happened before. So what I am assuming is you prefer BTC to be unusable. Not mass adoption. Using it in a few stores or low quality websites (because bigger ones dropped it after last year mess).

If that’s what you want, good! It sucks. "
Sorry, was just following your conversation, not the dude you were debating/discussing with.
I'm off work, sitting in my sofa. I'd rather do this than watch some stupid Netflix recommendation.
"I read a lot of opinions on this sub. Just because many people have them doesn't make them facts.

Most discussions here about LN for example are just completely wrong and a quick look at the available documentation would show that. The only spoonfeeding I see is the echochamber you have going here."
Yeah. None of the most productive core devs have been in federal prison or been forced to leave the country.
You are confusing an implementation with the protocol. Forks are protocol level events.
"> I read a lot of opinions on this sub. Just because many people have them doesn't make them facts.

The salient ones which you're unable to grasp clearly make your position untenable. And that is that the BTC sabotage was unjustified and idiotic from the start. There was never any legitimate reason for it, end of story. This is not an opinion, it is a fact.



> Most discussions here about LN for example are just completely wrong

The most commonly discussed failing of LN here is that it is impossible for it to be decentralised in light of the routing problem. This is once again not an opinion, it is a fact. The other stuff like ""can't get a payment through of size n given conditions x-z"" are interesting only for people who care about the function of LN given that *it is impossible for it to be decentralised*. That is not anyone who actually cares about the principles of a decentralised ledger to begin with, so of zero consequence to the discussion.

> and a quick look at the available documentation would show that.

The ""available documentation"" outright lies and obfuscates. The LN whitepaper sums up the solution to the routing problem as ""It'll be something like what happens on the broader internet"", completely negating the fact that's a trusted environment that doesn't have to deal with capacities and already has plenty of problems in and of itself. The ""documentation"" is largely idiotic propaganda.

> The only spoonfeeding I see is the echochamber you have going here.

The fact you think that given the idiocy you're so confidently parroting now in the face of the collapse of your interpretation of the state of the chains is exactly why I stick to my original diagnosis of you; You are a clueless fucking NPC unable to actually evaluate facts and come to conclusions on your own. You are seeking a truth that you will then regurgitate cluelessly and uncomprehendingly until the next time it is necessary for you to think independently, at which point you will seek a new propaganda fount which will tide you over to the next time, and so on, and so forth.

Anything to avoid *actually having to think for your fucking self*.

You and the hordes of idiots like you are why we can't have nice things.

Mining will have to be replaced at some point. Otherwise we get a future where every piece of matter in the universe is busy mining. I don't actually know the solution though, proof of stake is a bit iffy and federated trust is violently bad.

"So person who doesn't run bitcoin went to persons who are just doing busywork to keep the system honest (and are well paid) and said a bunch of stuff, allegedly, and this is supposed to mean something for me or bitcoin?

Do you understand the concept of trustless consensus? Why is this sub so obsessed with supposed leadership. There has only ever been one leader figure in bitcoin and that entity stepped down or died. No one else can take that spot."
You think the core devs aren't already plenty rich and extremely employable? Any one of them would have a new job before they are back at their homes. That theory doesn't hold up.
"If you build a subscription based product and you manage to get idiots to use it while at the same time off-loading the main chain then who am I to argue?

Exchanges and other financial players will become more and more irrelevant as the blockchain revolution continues. If they want to lock themselves up in a side-chain then I really have no issues with it. "
Needs community buy-in, more testing and an ecosystem that has embraced segwit. A blocksize increase would require a hard fork and a hard fork would very likely make segwit mandatory. The ecosystem is far from ready.
Yes. Changing an implementation and changing protocol is different. It's completely possible to rewrite a client completely while still following the same protocol.
I love the way you actually know what satoshi was thinking. It's an amazing ability, please tell me more.
"Of course there are unresolved issues with the LN. No one really doubt this. But instead of arguing solutions everyone here seems to actively wish for it to fail. It seems like a strange outlook in a tech focused forum like this. It seems to be a manufactured opinion. There are many alt-coins that have really cool ideas and I  personally wish them all the best.

There's just no other crypto that's so obsessed with arguing what it isn't like bch proponents. Focus should be on what you aim to be not on negging what you aren't."
If one company manages to ruin cryptocurrency then cryptocurrency deserves to die. Bitcoin is suppose to be anti-fragile, if it isn't it's doomed.
"Well at least my client doesn't contain code to break me off from the chain in order to not die when it lost a majority of the hashpower. So I guess I'll  just keep on basking in my unbroken chain of blocks, following the longest chain with the most work into the bright future.

I don't really have anything to be proud about though. It isn't like I made bitcoin or any bitcoin related systems. I did mine a few blocks on my CPU back in 2010 or 2011 though so that's nice. "
Except that they aren't my arguments.
You must live in a very weird world. Every single human system is a trade-off. There will always be some less than optimal byproducts. Mining is a tool to solve a problem. Mining isn't the point.
That's impossible. Layer 2 is depending on layer 1 without layer 1 layer two can't exist. 
Yeah. We aren't yet close to needing it. There's a lot of optimization left to do.
So a cap that's been in place for years suddenly becomes an abuse just because you think so? Doesn't seem reasonable.
"I don't think the cap should be permanent either. I still think the temporary cap is justified in some ways. 1sat/byte transactions go through every day.

Having rpi level hardware able to run a node doesn't mean that the same rpi is going to work indefinitely."
i am using it as payment every single day (fees 0.04-0.07$), so saying it is unusable, is a blatant lie.
"1. I'm not opposed to raising the block size
2. The Liquid Network is trustbased garbage
3. Anyone can make profits on Bitcoin. It's a permissionless system. This is impossible to change."
Did blockstream put that in?
Always happy to help. It's pretty exciting what's possible :) 
"> I just don't see bch doing anything

That's because you are not paying attention. I guess that's to be expected from someone only coming here to troll and not caring about using bitcoin as cash. "
Again you avoid all of the points being made. I can only conclude you either are incapable of getting it or are just here to troll. It's too bad.
Yeah, it's just not a very nice thing to say.
">Did blockstream put that in?

Yes. That code is part of Segwit, which was conceived and largely implemented by Pieter Wiulle and Luke-jr both Blockstream cofounders."
"1. Yes you are otherwise you would have upgraded like the rest of us.
2. True
3. It's a *congested* permissionless system. Congested means only a few can make a profit. And that ""few"" is Blockstream and a bunch of exchanges. That's it."
"No, not a lie when it’s a joke for new users (not user friendly) and you can’t receive more than what you settle your node with. Not a good way to create a payment system If you want to receive more than you spend. A total disaster. The midterm plan is to create watchtowers and to fund accounts with 3rd party channels. Not even talking about L-BTC. All this mess when you could easily scale the blocks. 30MB makes BCH a system capable of almost handling the same amount of txs of PayPal and we are talking about only 30MB per 10 minutes. It’s incredible the non sense.

"
"Yes, it was all okay when Satoshi and the ""good devs"" had it in their code base but as soon as they left it suddenly became the very symbol of blockchain oppression."
"I had similar problems around that time as well.

So I guess that one time around new years eve when the 3g network was overloaded caused you to throw away your phone and never use a cell phone again, right?"
"My recollection is that miners refused to implement the segwit upgrade for about a year before that. 

I did quite a few transactions around last December and I never paid 100 dollar fees."
what are you talking about? i am using main chain, not lightning. it works like a charm. minimal fee is usually confirmed in 1st or 2nd block. it is very user friendly, my friends open a mobile wallet, and i transfer them some btc...shows right up
I follow the main chain. If you have to have replay protection then you aren't the main chain.

You should read some of the history of bitcoin core and blockstream to see just how shady these people are.
"> You think the core devs aren't already plenty rich and extremely employable?

Most of them have missed the early boat big time and are massively butt hurt about it so they are now trying to extract fiat out of BTC. Namely Adam Back and Greg Maxwell. "
"> If you build a subscription based product and you manage to get idiots to use it while at the same time off-loading the main chain then who am I to argue?

Agreed, no problem with that. The problem is when you advocate against increasing capacity on the main chain in order to make your product viable."
Yes, exactly. 
Sure dude. Maybe you were away recently, but the inflation bug in Core already required a mandatory hard fork to segwit. And you know you're not going to get a better real-world test of bigger blocks than the Bitcoin Cash network building a 20mb block. But whatever you say.
"Sure but that's not what segwit did. If 51% of miners decided to switch to a different [pre-segwit] client ""following the same protocol"" as you put it, it would lead to a massive wipe-out of funds not due to any sort of security vulnerability but because segwit was a fundamental protocol change."
"You've got to be kidding me.

">Of course there are unresolved issues with the LN. No one really doubt this. But instead of arguing solutions everyone here seems to actively wish for it to fail. 

That's because we're actually listening to what the developers are saying it's going to be. It's not going to be peer to peer, they openly talk about giving preference to big banks and making it resemble the existing financial system. None of them believe in Bitcoin as a peer to peer currency and they say so

> It seems like a strange outlook in a tech focused forum like this. It seems to be a manufactured opinion. There are many alt-coins that have really cool ideas and I  personally wish them all the best.

I form my own opinions, thanks. If you want to hear about all of the path planning issues with lightning I'll happily tell you. My Master's thesis was on path planning

>There's just no other crypto that's so obsessed with arguing what it isn't like bch proponents. Focus should be on what you aim to be not on negging what you aren't.

Everyone here is focused on making Bitcoin better. The stress test was a huge success, the fees didn't rise at all (still fractions of a penny) and we were doing 8x the transactions what BTC has been artificially capped at. 

Multiple times the number of transactions BTC was doing when the fees went up to 55 dollars. This chain can now do more tx/s than PayPal normally does.

The test pretty thoroughly discredited most of the small block arguments honestly

"> Well at least my client doesn't contain code to break me off from the chain in order to not die when it lost a majority of the hashpower.   

This would be a problem if it was a minority valid chain trying to pretend its still Bitcoin. When this definition briefly applied to BCH during August 2017, it was a self-announced minority chain called Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and **NOT** Bitcoin.  

The only time I know of that a minority chain violated this process and tried to illegitimately claim the Bitcoin name was when SegWit1x continued in violation of a [~96% hash rate consensus agreement](https://twitter.com/mikebelshe/status/905737617718870018) at the supposed activation of 2x from the legacy BTC block chain. Instead, the < ~4% minority SegWit1x chain continued, usurping the ""BTC"" ticker, and (following widespread confusion) continued *illegitimately* using the Bitcoin name.  

> I'll just keep on basking in my unbroken chain of blocks....  

Unbroken by what standard? Not Nakamoto Consensus, and therefore the [Bitcoin white paper](https://nakamotostudies.org/literature/bitcoin/) no longer applies. If you want to **believe** your block chain is unbroken, you'll need to write a new white paper which can explain how going from the block before 2x activation to the first block of SegWit1x can ever be seen as **valid**. Good luck with that."
"> There will always be some less than optimal byproducts.

There are.  But mining is not a byproduct.  It's a central requirement for the product to operate in the first place.  If mining is inherently evil, and a core requirement for the Blockchain to operate, then perhaps we need to retire Bitcoin, and come up with a currency that doesn't require mining?

It would be nice, if you could pick your miner for a transaction.  But that would create it's own set of problems, with people just bouncing it's own set of transactions back and forth to reap the block reward."
"Yes that’s true.  Fees being artificially inflated to discourage on-chain transactions and providing off-chain mechanisms that require additional complexity or don’t exist yet is what I mean by supporting layer 2 at layer 1’s expense.

Bitcoin was intended to be used as a peer-to-peer global cash at layer 1.  The contention seems to be around whether or not that is technically and economically feasible.  I for one believe it is.  Proponents of Bitcoin-BTC seem to think it’s not and therefore layer 2 is necessary."

"""suddenly""

^ this guy, eh?!"
"> 1sat/byte transactions go through every day.

Fuck you.  In December 2017 I made a transaction with a large fee that did not go through for several days.  As a result I lost a substantial amount of money.  For me, this was visceral proof that BTC was broken.  A system that works ""every day"" when a few other people are using it but which fails to work when you need to use it is worth than useless.  It is dangerous."
In what way is the cap justified now? Were you not there in December when fees spiked to $100 or so? Back then mempool grew so large that the rPi nodes crashed too. So, who exactly benefited from that cap in December? You don't recall Steam abandoning Bitcoin (BTC) for payments because the fees got so ridiculously high? How did that benefit Bitcoin (BTC)? December 2017 was the make it or break it moment for Bitcoin (BTC) and the outcome was a complete disaster. Adam Back, One Meg Greg and other Blockstream scammers single-handedly pushed crypto adaptation back years and didn't learn a thing along the way. Stealing the fees from the miners will eventually lead to a situation where the miners direct their hash elsewhere and nobody is left to secure the Bitcoin (BTC) network nor process any transactions.. this is probably Blockstream's goal though. It will be proof of stake of LBTC.. just trust Blockstream and their selected partners in crime
You're still copy/pasting that talking point? Srsly bruh, you need to wake up. 
"So when bitcoin has high fees it's because it's crap and when it has low fees it's because it's crap. If it has high volume it's because there are too many deluded sheep and if it has low volume it's because everyone has left.

But for some magical reason these things don't apply to, say, bch.. Ok. sounds really legit."
"Much force. wow. such influence.

I don't buy your narrative. It doesn't fit. If blockstream had control over the system there are tonnes of other stuff it could have done instead of the nothing we have now.

"no, because Lightning has so way to many design limitations. from not being able to receive more money than you start with to routing issues to both client sender being online at the same time as well as the need for watch tower services.

Lightning was built form day1 as an excuse that Blockstream is solving Bitcoin's fees, but reality is it was just a stopgap until Liquid. Lightning design is worst than any shitcoin's worst wallet experience. No way that can compete to anything let alone Liquid."

> But I don't see what core and liquid has to do with each other.

If BTC were not sabotaged as it has been, liquid wouldn't be useful. It's that simple; they created a problem by their own action and are now selling the solution. End of story.

> It's completely possible and even completely okay to build stupid things on top of Bitcoin and it doesn't make Bitcoin any worse in the process. Side chains are meant to be able to fail.

For bleating npcs convinced beyond all reason that there is only one true bitcoin and it is the coin with the blessing of the central core propaganda crew, that's exactly what it does. Without things like liquid and lightning due to the technical roadmap for  btc, it flatly doesn't work, end of story. So now those aforementioned npcs either need to wake up, realize that and move to an actual legitimate cryptocurrency that is not a transparent and obvious attempt to destroy the concept, or engage in yet further mental gymnastics that this is fine and all part of the plan.

How about intentionally/needlessly crippling Bitcoin to make retarded/centralized sidechains viable?
"> Anyone is free to build whatever system they want on top of Bitcoin. 

This is patently untrue, for BTC.

I was building a 0conf risk assessment algorithm in 2012-2015. My algorithm would have been able to determine whether it is safe within configurable loss margins to release a product on an unconfirmed transaction receipt.

My efforts were resisted by Core developers on the grandest of scales, including personal attacks and hack attempts. My work was undermined not only by other ""cooperative"" coders that sought to mangle my work but by the BTC devs themselves.

In 2015, when Theymos posted his fateful announcement banishing ""90% of Bitcoiners"" from the community, I counted myself among them. I threw away my code and my algorithm and concluded that no, Bitcoin is **not** permissionless.

I am still bothered via PM from Core supporters to this day. Just two weeks ago I received and reported an unsolicited, harassing, and personally attacking PM. I gave up on the project and got rid of the code, but even that perceived threat I generated back then was enough to warrant such an extreme backlash that I am still personally targeted, despite having actually successfully produced nothing of value."
">But I don't see what core and liquid has to do with each other

Except that Blockstream has used heavy-handed social manipulation and coercion to gimp Bitcoins natural scaling solution into an abomination that will _force_ users to utilize 2nd layer solutions.

I don't know what kind of hold Blockstream has over the Core team, but it's obviously enough to dictate the direction of development and snuff out all dissent, internal and external.

Being along for the ride from the very beginning its nothing short of gut wrenching to see what Bitcoin was / promised and what it has been contorted into.

Given that blockstream maintain both core and liquid, there is a clear conflict of interest here.
"I said this to you yesterday so I guess I’ll repeat it to you again: none of us has a problem with layer two solutions and people getting rich off of it. 

**We have a problem with them intentionally crippling the throughput on the base layer so that most traffic has to go through their shit on the second layer.  To ensure profits for themselves.**

Everything that’s been done to the Bitcoin block chain lately has led up to the creation of LN and subsequently Liquid. 

At the end of the day this is about making Blockstream money, and paying back their $151 million in investors.  

Literally every social and humanitarian goal that Bitcoin had (directly tied to a functional base Layer) has been sacrificed for this purpose. That’s what we have a problem with.

How the fuck did they even get $151 million in investors for a completely free, decentralized currency system in the first place? 

Well they had to find a way to monetize it. And the only way they could do that was to cripple it and force throughput through their products.   **You can’t make money off Layer 2 if Layer 1 works just fine, for free.**  

Wake up. "
"I guess this will come across as me being an asshole, but you are halfway to Bitcoin Cash. If you keep looking at it, you will see.

BTC is effectively owned by ~~Blockchain~~ Blockstream and friends now. 3 or more years ago, people were already warning that the 1MB cap was so illogical that it must have another motivation - forcing a 2nd layer. Now here we are. And no, you will absolutely not be able to transact freely on BTC if there is any amount of adoption unless you have extremely low price sensitivity to fees. Additionally, mining is being disincentivized in the long term by the same situation - without a critical mass of miners, BTC will cease to be permissionless.

BTC is captured. Please see the reality."

I'm ridiculously woke bro. FYI LN and Liquid aren't really related.
"It's officially game over for Core minions. They cannot deny that they are doing the bidding of a scumbag corporation that has no interest in decentralized P2P electronic payment systems. Best quote of the article:

"> We have a problem with them intentionally crippling the throughput on the base layer so that most traffic has to go through their shit on the second layer. To ensure profits for themselves.

They don't only cripple the base layer, they're killing the mining industry by siphoning out all the potential future on-chain fees going to them.

>and paying back their $151 million in investors.

151 million? Maybe Liquid cost $1 million and the rest went on the PR and astroturfing propaganda campaign."
"I disagree, of course. I follow the longest chain with most work just as I always have. These layer 2 systems will decrease fees if anything since they move transactions off-chain. Also 2nd layer services require a well working 1st layer. They are not able to decouple. A loss of critical mass of miners would also kill layer 2 so I fail to see how anyone would let it go that far. Miners, devs and runners of layer 2 services are all stakeholders for layer 1.

My btc are owned by me and are sitting in a hardware wallet for which only I have the keys. No banker in the world can take them from me.

Lately transactions in the 1sat/byte range has gone through every day so the high fee narrative doesn't hold. 

And just take a look around you. Bch has only exchanged one set of potential masters for another set. And those vying for control of bch are complete loons.

If at any point I tire of holding btc then bch would be my absolute last possible alternative. There are tonnes of cryptos with more features and a better structured development."
and now we see Lightning was never planned to be finished, it was just a placeholder until they could announce Liquid.
"Owned by Blockstream, not Blockchain ;-)"
I don’t have to trust you if I don’t want, just like you don’t have to use Liquid if you don’t want. Beautiful thing eh?
This doesn’t make bitcoin centralized anymore than cryptokitties make ethereum exclusively a kitty trading platform. This is a second layer solution that some people can use if they want. It’s a highly efficient solution for exchange to exchange transactions and nothing more. It will in fact free up block space for the rest of us. 
Well, it was hard work crippling the legacy chain and coopting the dev team. Not to mention all the hours spent censoring and trolling!

"It's a guaranteed money maker for them.  They get the authority to sign transactions without needing to do any time and electricity consuming proof of work.

I'm sure they have to pay Blockstream for the privilege.  But in this system, there is no block reward, and there is no proof of work.  There are only fees."
as a bitcoin user, how does liquid affect me? i buy stuff with bitcoin online or from the local ads, do not use exchanges, and send bitcoin to other people...
Crickets. 
"And despite several teams working on it, Lightning has more problems to work around than even the worst shitcoin on the market now. 

Show me a wallet technology from any of the 2000+ altcoins on the market that has Lightnings limitations or worse. Lightning is 3 years late from it's original announcement date and still has bigger problems than even IOTA's wallets problems and that's saying a lot."
But everything is done so you don't have a choice
You don't *need* to get pushed off-chain? The only way to avoid getting pushed is to push others.
Thousands of years of trial and error but how many years have there been central bankers with this level of control? Probably less than 100 and look at how many market crashes and fiat currencies that busted since then. I think we can do better than central planning and fiat backed by nothing.
Miners are also guilty of this. If they would have acted as guardians of the network as envisioned by Satoshi, Core developers would have been left behind long ago and none of this would have happened.

I disagree. They have plenty of vision. The same vision of the people who are paying them to fuck over crypto. Their employers are incredibly wealthy, and smart... and cunning. They understand human psychology at its lowest level. They understand psychology to the point that they have convinced the entire world that paper notes have value... to the point where humans literally kills one another over.

"Bitcoin was intentionally crippled by Blockstream, because their core business is renting specialized hardware to exchanges for running Liquid.

Without Blockstream there would have been no scaling problem and no need for off chain scaling. It's all cool, as long as it's optional.

"ALL of them changed their opinion and they lie on the internet all day everyday there is so much shit cooming from them and their motive is unclear i really think if everything they did ""for bitcoin"" gets reavealed, bitcoin will die instantly cuz its so much fucking shady stuff."
I think its foolish to ignore some simple facts like how Blockstream was largely funded by AXA Strategic Ventures. AXA has had Bilderberg members on its board in the past. Bankers are the ones who bankrolled Blockstream and low and behold, they did all they could to halt progress and perform a hostile takeover to mutate BTC into something else they control, and turn Satoshi's original version (now called Bitcoin Cash) into the butt of jokes.

"Built on top of a decentralized peer-to-peer network. You don't actually *need* to use Liquid, as you don't *need* to use LN. 

Space in the blockchain has been overly cheap in the first ~10 years of bitcoin. It's cost will be more apparent when adoption continues to pick up. As such, use cases that are only viable with low cost transactions will slowly get pushed off-chain, like satoshis.place and Lightning Spin.

"Indeed.

Core developers took something that was *revolutionary* and started turning it into the *ordinary*. Permissionless and trustless into permisisoned and trusted as if they simply could not wrap their minds fully around Satoshi's original concept, and thus began rebuilding the code into a centralized piece of plumbing for Liquid and Lightning.

Nah, it just means that nobody at Blockstream has any vision. But plenty of people in the BCH and ETH worlds have vision... it's just that it's never been done before. It's easier to ape something else, like Blockstream is doing.

"I'm a ""core minion"", at least according to the definition here, and I think this liquid sidechain is a centralized trustbased abomination.

But I don't see what core and liquid has to do with each other. Anyone is free to build whatever system they want on top of Bitcoin. Liquid would work just as well/badly on top of bch. 

It's completely possible and even completely okay to build stupid things on top of Bitcoin and it doesn't make Bitcoin any worse in the process. Side chains are meant to be able to fail."
"Liquid sacrifices decentralization and trustlessness for the benefit of liquidity. When exchanges are only sending to each other, they can sacrifice decentralization and trustlessness. It's very impractical and inefficient to send transactions between exchanges as globally broadcast and confirmed transactions. Almost as impractical and inefficient as paying for coffee with a globally broadcast and confirmed transaction would be. This only benefits the main chain by taking transactions that don't benefit from being on the main chain off the main chain, which makes transactions that do benefit from being on the main chain cheaper and faster.

Do you guys really think that paying for coffee on the main chain is practical or efficient? "

This is where the fallacy comes in.  Mining is not cheap.  It requires the purchase of hardware.  And it requires electricity.  If there are less transactions, then miners will need to cover their costs of operation by charging more in fees.to offset the cost of electricity and hardware, if they can't cover their cost with block rewards.  And if miner competition forces fees so low that it's impossible to make a profit, then miners will either go mine another coin, or shut down their rigs entirely and stop mining.

The best ways to keep fees low is with LOTS of transactions constantly flowing and a blocksize big enough to handle it."
Transaction fees are down because transaction volumes are down because BTC isn't being used for anything any more.

That's *exactly* how decentralised networks work. If you don't like the way the chain is proceeding you fork off, nobody can stop you from doing it and it's perfectly alright to do if you're convinced that it's necessary. In this way the chain is guaranteed to eventually succeed at one of its ends, and the forks that you're utterly convinced are worthless are effectively simply free offers to increase you stake in the fork you're convinced is the real thing.

By contrast, forcing everyone to stay together on a chain that has now transparently descended to exactly the state everyone knew and said it would for years is not ""decentralised"" at all. It's a parody of decentralisation to retain the power structures of centralisation whilst being simultaneously cheered on by clueless hapless fuckwits like you.

> Media has been twisting everything to make it hard to determine reality. We were told that if Segwit launched, bitcoin would crash and burn. A year in and ... gasp.. were completely fine.

You're flatly wrong. Blockstream sabotaged bitcoin by forcing through an idiotic technical roadmap that only the utterly ignorant support in order for their other products to actually have a purpose.

Will you be able when more users have adopted it and the blocksize stays at 1mb as dictated by the central btc authority? 
Blockstream/core already showed that they will not increase block size. If $100 fees will not do it, then nothing will. AFAIR Bitcoin Judas tweeted that he would like to see $1000 fees. Luke would like even smaller blocks, etc. Aiding on-chain scaling goes directly against Blockstream/core profit making interests. Bitcoin (BTC) will never scale, but they will gladly sell their LBTC as Bitcoin and collect the fees..

"Layer 2 can't work if layer one isn't working. The chain of events you are describing is nonsense.

Anyone is free to modify the bitcoin protocol, it's completely open source. The problem is getting the bitcoin network to follow you."
Miners were always a tool to be used for their selfish economic incentives. Assuming a moral duty is the complete antithesis of what Bitcoin was supposed to be. The market will ultimately decide the value of BTC and the miners will reassemble to maximize their self-interest. The problem is that Core took the most popular, , secure, and ubiquitous distributed consensus network and totally bungled the whole thing up, now leading us down a less than desirable timeline whereby BTC is unlikely to succeed, which is needless and a shame. However, this was one possibility of events that has occurred and we can only move on from where we are and move forward. While it is a shame, there is not much to be done other than cooperate with people who do share that vision, and build something together. I think this is already happening so I feel this whole BTC issue will be a relative historical speed bump as well as serve as a glowing historical example of complete dbags who tried to con people for their own personal profit. 
"Why is everyone suddenly using the term ""npc""? I guess it sounds better than calling people a ""bot"" or a ""shill"" or whatever. Just seems so strangely coordinated."
