In the whitepaper, on page 4 (though Cobra might have edited that out in your edition), it is written:

circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.

The exact value, whether it is 21mio coins, or 42mio coins, or *whatever*, **does not matter**.

What matters is that it is a predetermined amount, thus fixed since Bitcoin's beginning.

And, yes, go ahead and *try* to change the 21mio coin limit, if that's your think. All other people will ignore you or other crazies for attempting this.

You know all of the above, I know all of the above.

"This is such utter crap. You've spent the last two, maybe three, years telling the community what they should be thinking. There was basically zero controversy over raising the blocksize limit until *you personally* created it. 

Jump in a time machine to 2013 and ask if anyone sees a problem with raising that limit beyond 1MB and Luke-Jr Is the only person who would stick up his hand. 

But you were so determined that Bitcoin should scale your way or not at all that you've now spent years convincing people their nodes will explode if that limit is increased. That they need to be able to run a full node off a raspberry pi and a USB memory stick.

Bitcoin clearly isn't worthless, but it probably will be if you don't loosen the death grip, put aside your ego, and come to some sort of rational compromise. Remember Adam's 2-4-8 proposal from a million years ago? Is that also crazily reckless and destructive in your world view? If not then fucking implement it already. Put some sort of genuine blocksize scaling into Core and let the community adopt or reject it instead of telling them what they want."
It would create a small mining jam if every miner tried to mine this bonus transaction, ignoring other miner's attempts.

Pretty much this. 
But you're sure you understood the concept of coins everyone can spent in this TX? Other Big Block supporters can spent the outputs also with a high fee and so the value based on that 273 BTC Fee TX could become a lot higher.
And what happens with the fees when the forked chain is not orphaned after the first, but the second or third block?
PoS and pointless non mining nodes are totally unrelated. What are you trying to say exactly? 
Valid transactions are determined by whether or not miners have included it in a block which they have agreed to put work on it. Non mining nodes validate transactions for themselves but aren't enforcing anything. The consensus rule mechanism is enforced with a combination of economic incentives, mining and PoW. That process is very well explained in the whitepaper.

"No, it *is*, as per social contract? Don't be obtuse on purpose.
"
"Right. However...

1) Because of the capacity limit, average fees required to make it into a block have gone up what, like 300% or more in the past 6 months? Even more if you factor in the price increases. There is no good justification for this when the block reward is 12.5 BTC and we are sitting at all time high prices per coin.

2) The block reward does not need to be entirely replaced by fees for at least the next 7 - 10 years, maybe more especially if the price keeps going up. Why now when the industry is just barely starting to mature?

3) A restrictive capacity limit is not necessary whatsoever to allow fees to eventually replace the subsidy. This can and will happen naturally as the network grows. The easiest way to replace the subsidy is to process more transactions. More volume = more BTC earned. Profiting off of volume is literally one of *the* most basic ideas in business. 

4) The idea that nobody will bother to pay fees if there is excess capacity makes no sense at all. If that were the case, why have users had no problem paying fees for the past 8 years when blocks weren't full?

"He's dishonestly referring to a bug in the locking system (see BIP50), which wasn't triggered by all blocks over 500k, as a 500k effective limit.

I don't think he's talking about the roundtable agreement.
"When you're a miner, and you have a mempool > blocksize, you get to select the most profitable TXes to confirm. When you're a miner, and you have a mempool < blocksize, you will just include all of the TXes that offer a nonzero fee because including a TX in a block to be mined is almost free compared to the cost of mining a block.

So what will happen with an arbitrarily large blocksize? TX fees will tend to zero, because all miners will selfishly mine all TXes they can get their hands on, and there will be no TX fee competition for blockspace."
"The production of a block costs electricity. The inclusion of TXes in a block costs a negligible amount (by approximation 0). Therefore the marginal cost of a TX confirmation (the act of including a TX in a block) is 0. Therefore, with an unlimited supply (arbitrarily large blocks) TX fee will tend to 0.

I mean, I'm a big blocker, but we can't just go full yolo on that economic code right there."

It's pretty-much zero. They have to receive the transaction and then recompute the rightmost-branch of a Merkle tree. If they don't want to risk making a bad block they'll validate the transaction first. This is all less than a millisecond of computation, the validation is parallelizable across transactions, and none of this interrupts mining at all."

This is why it would be wise for a miner to leave some for the next miner. This increases his chances of success and prevents the block from triggering such race..
"> Changing a 1 to a 2 is not endless supply

No alt-clients in existence right now *just* change a 1 to a 2. The alt-client in particular that r\btc likes to push is BTU. BTU does not ""just"" change a 1 to a 2. It fundamentally hands over control of the blocksize to a very small subset of Bitcoin users in China.

I haven't been ""duped."" I fight the good fight for a 2MB+SW HF for over a year. I only acquiesced recently after finally realizing two things:  

1) They are NOT going to hard fork first. It's simply not going to happen, and  
2) none of the current alternatives are viable. In fact, most, like BU, are critically and dangerously flawed.  

After some soul searching, and a little hands-on time with SW on Testnet, I decided that I'm ok with either 1MB+SW or the status quo -- until such a time that we come up with an actually viable alternative that doesn't accelerate centralizing and potentially destroy the entire system."

I think *you* might well quit. I think we're all really hoping that happens. But the mass strike you envisage just won't happen."
As a deliberate part of consensus or a bug or by proxy due to something else?
"Afaik 500kb was a soft limit. The 1mb hard limit was imposed as a temporary measure to protect the network from a spam attack that could attempt to grow the chain prematurely to discourage people from running nodes. It was never intended to be permanent, and was supposed to be lifted before the network reached the artificial capacity limit. Keep in mind, the limit was set back in the days of the 10k BTC pizza. When it was trading for pennies and there was literally only one business in the entire ecosystem, 1gb>/week growth of the chain would have been premature. 

Edit: 1mb hard limit was imposed after the initial release. The 500kb limit he refers to did not prevent nodes from accepting larger blocks as valid, only from creating them. For some reason, he left that fact out. Would you give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he simply didn't know?"
No, I wasn't talking about a soft limit. Until 0.8 nodes would more or less randomly reject blocks over 500k in size.  There was _also_ a mining limit so they wouldn't create them.
"If you want to get technical, 500kb was a soft limit. When we soft forked to 750kb, there was actually a chain split due to a bug in the bdb library the software used back then, which caused clients running the previous version to reject the bigger blocks (or maybe the other way around, it was over 4 years ago and I'm going from memory). It occurred March 12 2013, there were blog posts about it posted the next day, in case you're interested in finding more information about the event. 

Edit: there was no hard 1mb limit originally. The first nodes wouldn't move blocks over 500 kb but they would accept them. See my other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/69318u/z/dh4b3mk) for why the 1mb hard limit was added."
Sure.
"Actual text logs? What are you talking about. 

Maybe you ignored those conversations. But I participated in them. Doesn't mean they didn't happen. 

You're going to tell me that people havent been expressing concern about the block size for 4+ years? I remember Gavin on LTB podcast in 2013 having a half hour conversation with them about it. 

I guess if you live with blinders on, you can create your own reality."
Do you lol each time Core is losing hash power? I do as well .
"> It's less boring than pretending that incompetent developers are the right ones to hand the safety of our bitcoins over to

You don't have to do that. You can continue to use Core ...
Just change the 1MB to an 8MB or so.

> while their ""Chief Scientist"" or secretary or whatever he is, is giving talks to Coinbase wherein he explicitly states he doesn't expect Bitcoin Unlimited to become the dominant client at all, but only the first in a long string of stepping-stones towards client heterogeneity.

"BU, Classic, EC, BIP100 EC? Also more and more independent implementations.

As well as simply patching Core for larger blocks, if you love them too much otherwise."
You are either flat out wrong or lying. The original Bitcoin software would not mine blocks over 500kb, but it would accept them. The 1mb hard limit was [added later and not meant to be permanent](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/69318u/z/dh4b3mk).
">If it is a fixed value from the beginning and the code that was released with the limit is the canonical source

Adherence to the 21M limit is not done ""because the original code is canonical"". It's done because it's a good monetary idea. That reasoning in no way implies that the 1MB blocksize limit should be adhered to. (The limit wasn't even in the original code!)"
"We put up a solution for 2MB capacity-- a good one, endorsed by almost every developer-- one that reduce risks and improved scalability.

Then, oops. 2MB wasn't what was wanted anymore and ""unlimited"" became the new goalpost.

OK, let's try that again. Satoshi's whitepaper talked about a predetermined number of coins. Where did he discuss a predetermined blocksize limit?

Either way the more you write the more you hurt your own company and the people who rely on it to pay their bills."
Interesting, what was the cause of the limitation?  I love historical trivia.
You leave out the part where that limit prevented nodes from mining larger blocks but not from accepting them, ie a soft limit. You should know this unless you are completely unfamiliar with the history of Bitcoin prior to April 2013, which I find very difficult to believe. This leads me to the inescapable conclusion that you are being intentionally deceitful due to motives one can only speculate about - this thread is full of such speculation, so I'll refrain from joining the chorus.
"So the system we have now isn't Bitcoin? We've already ""hard forked"" to bigger blocks?"
"The 1Mb limit was added later, as a temporary anti-spam measure. Never intended to be permanent.
Satoshi himself described ways to increase/phase it out."
I feel like this levels the playing field a bit against UASF (Which is a hard fork)
"No. That would be just 100 separate transactions. But think of them as a chain or a tree structure, where the next TX can only be mined if it's predecessor(s) are mined, too.  

But anyway, the really important point will be the first block > 1MB because it requires a hardfork and some kind of agreement between a majority of miners about the new parameters.

"Oh yes. They are going to flip shit today with a manner of FUD that we have seen all too often from them.

so far it looks like single rich-as-fuck person (or corporation) trying to buy themselves a change to bitcoin protocol for some (maybe even perfectly valid) reason.
"Others don't need to make 1MB transactions of their own.

All they need to do is use one of the outputs in the above transaction as an input to a smaller transaction that has a huge fee (it could be 200 bytes, it's irrelevant)

By using the output from the 1MB transaction above, the transaction can not confirm until the above transaction confirms.

It's actually very easy... but you would need a wallet software that can make it easy for people to use."

"This would be a great idea ... if miners alone were actually enough to successfully hard fork bitcoin. As it is, it might at best motivate a splitting fork. Even that requires that there are significant numbers of people willing to pay money for the coins, though.

Edit: Also, this kind of amount of fees in a *single block* is itself somewhat destructive to the incentive structure in the forked chain. More precisely, it's big enough that it motivates miners to ignore each others blocks containing this transaction because they want to mine it themselves.

"It works for me; decodes to a valid transaction. Didn't check the signature."
It is huge, but for a miner with ~15% hashpower, that's the same amount as the block reward of one day. For a miner, it's probably still a decent chunk of money, but not an insanely large one.

Yes, but let's assume good faith because Bitcoin is trustless... 
If the miners are adequately greedy and coordinated, they could simply decide not to include that transaction before they increased the blocksize...
Is that a problem? It can be retracted, but as long as it isn't retracted it is usable.
It sounds a lot, but that's only about 1 day of tx fees, or < 15% of daily reward. If the BTU token worths less than 85%, it has no incentive to fork.
Ideally then every mining pool will start their own chain, each chain requiring that the chain start with this reward block as claimed by its respective owner pool.

That reward seems....excessive.

"**Clarification:**  This transaction puts zero of SaveTheChain's BTC at risk, and would put zero of anyone else's BTC at risk if they added to the contribution.  Why?  Because BTC cannot be spent in a block > 1MB or in any block that is a descendant of such a block.  This transaction is only valid on a forked chain and not on the original chain.

**What it means**: If you can get a miner to create a fork by mining this block with BU, there will be two chains and then the battle between two bitcoins escalates beyond reddit and becomes two chains competing for value and attention, just like what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, only with 25 times the stakes as denominated in USD.

It's not really trustless, as on the verge of BU forking you could at the very last minute spend one of those inputs making the entire transaction invalid. Miners (and the community) have no assurances you won't do this.
Great, now core is going to offer a huge reward for someone to mine a 1mb block. (Kidding, of course. I guess the asymmetry here has its advantages.)

Out of curiosity, couldn't a large segwit-only transaction, if mined and built upon thereafter, be similarly used for the network to immediately adopt segwit?
"Interesting to see another thread on a similar post to my own [Here - 1mb tx Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68d4r1/1mb_txn_update/?st=j29qhzye&sh=1ece6077) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6747e2/1mb_fork_txn/?st=j23ahmns&sh=194320b7)

In my two posts, I believe those that participated in the discussion concluded this approach won't split the chain, unless there are irrational miners and a flag mechanism.  Here's why:

- Assuming less than 51% of the hash power sees the >1mb chain as valid, the small block chain with 51% will eventually create a longer chain that all nodes will see as valid, and the >1mb chain will be orphaned.

- No bounty should be required to fork the chain.  If there was a clear economic incentive to create larger blocks, miners would already be doing this, since the new chain would be more valuable to the market.

So in order for this to work, at least two things need to happen:

- Miners need to run a customized node that doesn't revert back to the small block chain, if the split does not have the majority of hash power.  This requires some type of flag.

- Miners that want to take an ideological stand, and risk the economic downside of this decision need to commit to mine the chain.  This is irrational for most miners.

Hope that helps, and credit to /u/approx- for the original idea"
"1. If I understand correctly, once this tx is mined, the block wouldn't be recognized and propagated by segwit nodes, hence a sustained momentum would needed to outrun the core shitcoin chain?

valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them is bitcoin not BTU or BCU."
Now that's a plot twist.
"Someone's nervous enough to make up some blatant bullshit, ey?

Perhaps mixed in with some envy about someone having a balance larger than 2 digits in BTC, and with seemingly enough to spare to put their money where their mouth is?

You're one transparent and despicable person."
Hahahah you're a fool
Dude, this is becoming sad and pathetic.
/u/nullc please provide an address I would like to make a dependent tx for you
"lol, stay mad. This has got to be the most delusional and petty comment I've seen you make yet, and that's saying something.

That feeling at the pit of your stomach? The walls are closing in, Greg. History is not going to be kind to you when we write it."
Mr. Toxic, at it again talking about things that don't exist. BU will always be worth more than 1mb CoreCoin after you hard fork yourself away from the network (to lower the difficulty). gg
"Oh screw off mate. Bitcoin is the longest chain after genesis block [0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block). 

The 1mb limit wasn't even there to begin with, and there is nothing making it impossible to remove - it's pure politics (or just shit-throwing, it seems). 

If I were you I'd make sure to get off my high horse before the caravan rides away from me. There are many great blockchain startups to create and you're a smart and famous coder. "
"So, because this transaction requires a block greater than 1mb in size, it's automatically a Bitcoin Unlimited transaction? Why not a Bitcoin Classic transaction? Or a BIP100 compatible transaction?

What specifically about this transaction requires Bitcoin Unlimited?"
What is BTU?
You're in denial. It's nothing other than good old Bitcoin. But ok, you're putting you're just defending your AXA position, defending your business model, no matter if that business model fucks up Bitcoin, that's too one of the acceptable outcomes of your crusade. Can't really blame you, with that kind of money from AXA you have (and I believe we don't know shit about it), probably most would do the same. All you need is to persuade yourself you're doing the great thing, and it seems that you successfully accomplished just that.
please short it then
Great. Thanks.
Indeed. It simply helps to open the floodgates to mass adoption, proves Core is FOS and .... ^^moon ! :-)
"They will say the miners were bribed and compromised. I don't care if they are ""paid/bribed"" with bitcoins, it is playing by the rules of bitcoin.

As people that have attacked BU in the past have said ""All's fair in crypto."""
"> If this is true, we should be expecting trolls to heavily talk shit on this. label it as an ""attack"", etc.

Don't worry, /u/nullc's shift just started. Already happening."

Unfortunately, this only shows that there is one individual willing to put ridiculous amounts of money towards this. Even if it gets continuation transactions, there's really no way to tell whether they're from the wider community or all manufactured by the same single person.
"273 btc is not much in comparison with current total daily fees (excluding mining reward). Basically it will cover a bit more than a day of lost fees (which will be mostly lost after block increase):

https://blockchain.info/en/charts/transaction-fees
"
"Indeed. And, in my understanding at least, if the capped chain software was not patched, all the clients following it would receive all the transactions for both chains, but only one of the chains would be able to process the transactions efficiently. They'd quickly drift from each other and some transactions of the uncapped chain would be deemed ""invalid"" by the capped chain clients, though.

But in the end I think it's very unlikely that the uncapped chain would die."
"Funds come back (not spent) if the block is orphaned. So zero risk.

A mineral can spend the fee sharing it with other miners creating an incentive to build on the blick.

Bitcoin is governed by incentives that's why miners secure the blockchain. 

"
If its orphaned then you don't lose your coins, genius
"If the block is orphaned, you don't lose your bitcoin, additionally, you can still spend your outputs and invalidate your child transactions if you ""give up"" on Bitcoin."
"As someone else already wrote: the clever approach for a miner would be to not pocket the full amount, instead mining another TX which in turn has about half of the money as fee. And so on, so there would be a big incentive to continue the big block chain.  

But looking at your history, clever is not for you, apparently."
How will Ethereum move to proof-of-stake if miners don't support it? I tell you how: Ether holders look at Ether miners as useful cows that pull the waggon, while you worship the miner-cows like a Hunduist.

If the first excessive block miner takes all 273BTC, there is no incentive for other miners to extend the chain and it will certainly die. Eventually, the first excessice block miner will get nothing but losing 14BTC of block reward
You, as the person who made the original signatures, could just make new signatures. They are safe (presumably at least) from a third party causing issues, but it's the first party who benefits from double spending when the miners move to hardfork.
The bounty is 273 coins, but not necessarily $500K.  Since this tx can only be mined on a backwards incompatible chain, we would get 2 chains.  The two coins would have floating values.  273 coins on a 1MB chain is indeed $500K, but on a 2MB chain, we have no idea.  The value of these 273 coins could be $1,000,000 or it could be $1.  It's not possible to attribute a value to them without a free market (including a futures market) to trade them.
"Can you upload the raw transaction?
https://anonfile.com/
"
Thanks.
Sure, but a quarter of this size is still huge
"Imagine how much hashing power could be added to the pool that mined the output.

If they spent the whole reward they could carve out a nice 2-5% bump in residual profits."
Bitfinex the exchange where you can't withdraw fiat, and only Bitcoin and may be insolvent and has $100 premiums for Bitcoin, and a bunch of stipulations and terms for their BTU tokens, like it must happen before December 31st among other caveats.
"A BTU token does not equate a BU bitcoin because of the bizarre terms attached by bitfinex. But you already know that; I'm just clarifying for newbies that might see this.."
How did the biggest asshole in bitcoin get to be in the position you're in?  
"I see that you don't feel like adulting today.

Awesome."
I would like to pledge 1 BTC to the cause: 0.25 BTC directly to whoever hosts the site and 0.75 BTC to the transaction fee pot.
"There is no such thing as ""economic"" nodes. There are mining nodes and pointless non mining nodes. "
Did you ask me to setup 1000 nodes?
any split that did happen would have a coin capped with 1MB and a coin that wasn't, the sheer usability of the one vs the other would over time kill the capped chain unless they did a POW change or something
"Miners alone wouldn't do it unless there was a good chance the community would follow, since even with half a million dollars up for grabs it won't be worth anything unless the rest of the commmunity is on board. However, it may give miners the boldness to do what is necessary to get the community in gear:

Schedule a block height at which the miner commits to publish at least one >1MB block, several weeks or months in the future, so that futures markets like those on BitMEX can begin trading on the value of the two resulting chains. The miner risks around $20,000 (at least) but has a chance to gain half a mil.

Another incentive would be to offer money (on both chains) just for mining a few >1MB blocks, even if the bigger-blocks chain goes fallow immediately. That way the miner would risk nothing. What this would achieve is it would allow for futures trading on the split, so that we could for the first time in history have a clear market indicator of the relative valuation the market would place on the Core path vs. the bigger blocks path. (Rather than the current situation where we can't know why the price is going up or whether it would go higher if we had Segwit or higher if we had bigger blocks.)

Even if bigger blocks lose in trading, that is still a great outcome, potentially, because it would show clearly that market likes Core's roadmap and thus the way forward for orice growth for now. However unlikely that scenario is, if it *did* happen (and there was good reason to believe the prediction market was operating correctly) I would be prepared to re-evaluate my stance on the debate, at least for the near term. 

Likewise, if the bigger-blocks chain wins in futures trading, the community will likely gear up for it and we will have it, with many small blockers similarly re-evaluating their stances. 

Either way we get resolution and a clearly market-backed path forward."
"> This would be a great idea ... if miners alone were actually enough to successfully hard fork bitcoin.

Remember that whole concept of ""economic majority"" and other poorly defined and impossible to measure metrics? This type of transaction is a clear and direct expression of the will and desire from Bitcoin users/holders to see the transaction limit raised. 

It's not quite proof of stake voting, but the more funds that get pledged to this thing the harder it is for you to claim that no true bitcoiner wants to fork the blocksize."
"> Miners will lose 12.5 bitcoin if they mine this transaction, because economic nodes won't accept the block. 

""Economic"" likely in the sense that the node is economic enough to run on your old cellphone :-)

(And no one else will care about your cellphone when the time comes)"
Meanwhile, he didn't yet.
A multitude of clients could upgrade to 2MB or even 4MB easily, keeping the other consensus rules in place.
"so it's a way to create node consensus of >1mb?

If this is true, we should be expecting trolls to heavily talk shit on this. label it as an ""attack"", etc.  "
"The ""BTU token"" is unrelated to this (and to BU).

Refer to what others have written in this thread about ""BTU"" / ""BCU""."
There's going to be a point where it is enough money though. The question is-- how much BTC is enough to make this happen? Is it 250 BTC? 1000 BTC? 10000 BTC?
So if this reaches high amount Bitcoin will fork 
"Worth it if you want to lose your coins.

Even if eventually a miner is bribed enough by the amount of fees to mine a > 1MB block, the block will be orphaned by the rest of the network. There's no incentive for other miners or notes to accept the block.

Nice try though, Roger."
Cool. Could we then bribe the miners to steal from the rich and give that to poor? :) (and some % for the miners, of course)
1 day but for a 10% pool, 10 days worth of mining, and an even greater % of net profit...and thats if the reward doesnt grow at all.

In case anyone needed a millionth example of Greg telling a blatant lie, here you go.
"> Is there anything stopping you from spending these outputs on the main chain right now as smaller transactions?

Yes, how do you split up the transaction but keep the signature valid?

> And if not, how can we trust that you won't double spend them before the hardfork happens so you don't lose your money?

Nothing, except maybe coordinated miner greed. They don't have to mine transactions that would take that bounty away."
Not worst than restricting the blockchain capacity to renforce one business model (blockstream)
The block does, and it will be when you add the block header and coinbase.
"Not just for Core, for as many other clients as possible.
4-8MB would buy some more time, but even 2MB would be a good start as long as they test that it works.

For Core, this is still lacking tests, but looks reasonable:

https://github.com/whitslack/bitcoin-infinity"
Thanks
"""if multiple miners do this.""

And that will cause a chain split and send BTU and BTC price plunging.

And that's a good thing for me as I'm betting the price of BTC to drop significantly"
"Or, we can keep blocks small....say 1.01 Mb to make sure it automatically gets spread amongst miners. ;)"
Fair points!
Yes it IS 2000000 bytes
"The tricky part here is timing.

How is a miner going to patch his code in a few minutes?

The idea requires a patch that can cleverly configure behaviour based on remaining reward and current big block rate. This is not so trivial.

Alternatively, miners need to coordinate off chain."
1 BTC from me too
