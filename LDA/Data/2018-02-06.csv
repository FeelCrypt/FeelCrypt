"Not so, it's a scam. 

Take California. They got the state lottery passed by making a law saying that all proceeds from the lottery would be spent on the schools. Everyone thought this was a great idea.

About $300 million was generated for schools the next year. And all of it went to the schools. So technically they weren't lying.

What actually happened is that the state reduced state funding to schools by $300 million and allowed lottery money to plug the gap. Total school funding did not increase at all, and the legislators got $300m in play money for free to spend on w/e they wanted, and it was all technically legal.

The large print giveth, and the fine print taketh away."
This is about a comparison of risk. Compared to your odds of losing the lottery, buying any cryptocurrency isn't even close to as risky. Especially given nearly a decade long history of value increase long-term.
Satoshi dice?
"To store your money in a place where ordinary theives off the street can't get to it. When banks first came around, they also served as currency exchanges.

It's quite outdated in this day and age, IMO, unless you live in a high crime area. "
I mean if we're talking life savings then why aren't we putting our life savings in lottery tickets too?

Tether will bail us out! 
I don't get this narrative at all, since when did the people give governments or banks the mandate to decide what risk you decide to take?
Makes sense bro, thanks for clarification.
Right but if you never transact (sell for fiat or use it) it’s not a very good currency
If you have losses, then yes.
Because that is very diificult to do
Wow that’s fucked, honestly not surprised with the state of politics now a days, thanks for that. I’m gonna look into it further.
But lottery don't cost u much hahaha, and for fun mostly
"what govt recommended investing in lottery tickets?  lol

sounds like a false analogy..."
Get back to me when transactions fall to zero.
"I don't know if you're memeing or being serious.

With crypto, the players are just other people in the world. Go up, go down, its a 0 sum game. People are buying and selling with no way of enforcing transactions or ensuring that people actually get paid and are secure (I'm looking at you Mt. Gox). In this way, it is the wild fucking west and its gambling.

""But bewilderment, muh block chain."" Yeah, you know how block chain works? Its a global ledger of every transaction ever made and transactions are validated and added to the ledger by validating hashes (reversing them) which can take half an hour. So imagine waiting half an hour at a supermarket register to buy a pack of gum. 

Or in the case of buying and selling crypto, imagine you're trading Litecoin for Bit or cashing out. Now, you submit a transaction. When does the buy or sell order go through? When the exchange is validated or when its initiated? At the end of the day, the ledger only records a transaction between 1 wallet and another on the same coin. How you cash out is an entirely different system NOT enforced by blockchain (but durr we can build more block chains. Yeah fuck not gonna even discuss that.)

With a lottery, the players are the people and the government where the government is giving away the money and the people are buying into the game. At least in this way, the game is regulated and there are multiple safeguards for playing (age restriction, guarentee of payment, spelling out what it means to buy a lottery ticket, and gambling addiction help ) and at the end of the day, the lottery is used as essentially a tax on people who are bad at math and just want an emotional adrenaline kick. At least the money goes to a public cause.

Its the difference between riding a bicycle with training wheels and a motorcycle at a grand prix, both without prior training.

You actually think a majority of the people buying crypto know what the fuck they're doing? No. Absolutely not. If you ask them what the value of any particular crypto is, they couldn't fucking distinguish Eth from Bitcoin. All they know is ""durr it goes up I must buy and watch the investment go up because it goes up.""

And when these idiots spend lose their life savings in the bubble, who's gonna pick up the tab? The government. These idiots spend the rest of their lives on welfare and the government needs to support them. So how about they just fucking not let people ruin their own lives to begin with?"
Well lottery money apparently is given to local governments for schools and things of the like, at least in the state (USA) I live... so there’s that. 
At least with lottery tickets, I know exactly what my chances are. 
BTC and BCH have been hovering around the same values down and up, again, what are you on about?
"I love being right!!
"
Wow, you are going as far as completely ignoring reality. Have you not looked at the btc/bch trading pairs?
Honestly I don't care. I'm not interested in the performance of BCH against BTC. I wanna see BCH thrive no matter what it's relative value to BTC is. I couldn't give a flying fuck about BTC anymore.
Thats a better excuse than Craig Wright has. He claims to be Satoshi but he forgot his private key.
"Of course they have and you are completely correct.

 That was my point, I guess. Everyone in this space should be supporting each other but maddeningly, people keep shiposting each other as the walls are crumbling upon us. I don't own bch anymore, but there is nothing wrong with it. Nor is there much wrong with btc.  Nobody needs a fight to the death as there is ample room for both.

But if a fight to the death is insisted upon, well so be it. "

"I feel like crypto could fall to $100 BTC levels and this sub would still be fighting the same war to be recognize BCH as ‘true’ bitcoin.

"I agree, the community needs to be less hostile to each other. I feel as if personal holdings are a great influence to that. I hold a small amount of btc, but I can see where it has its faults. I’m not one to sprinkle my comments with ad hominem and meaningless fluff when talking with peoples who’s view differ to my own. 

With that being said, I believe btc will rise again due to speculation of course, but I think what all btc holders should really be betting on is the adoption of lightening network for continuing long term growth. I have my own opinions about how that’ll work out, but that’s not really important. 

What’s important, is that LN could make or break bitcoin, IMO. We’ll just have to see if the devs are able to pull it off, adoption and all. If that doesn’t happen, maybe a completely separate coin will beat btc and bch. That’d be the ultimate end, while both sides were up in arms with each other, the underdog (maybe ethereum) will come take the top spot. 

Who know what’ll happen, this is all *my opinion*

Everyone in BCH subreddits is talking as if BCH didn't also crash down from 3k to below 1k. not trying to stir shit here but hey, we're all in this thing together, whether you want to identify with one side of the bch/btc argument or you don't want to pick a side.
Gas usually leaves a bloated corpse.
It's fucking 6k now, wtf is going on?
No, I can't remember the exact figure now, but I dumped bch about  the end of November. In any case, the real reason I got out of bch was this very community. It sounded then, and still does, like a weird cult. 
Funny thing is that everytime I look, BCH is falling relative to BTC.
Thanks for dumping you BCH even below this price !
BCH is crashing faster than BTC, in case you haven't noticed.
BCH just dropped below 1000...
"The new investors are dumping dude, the old ones are buying at every step.

And the new investors are all who bought BTC over 1 K mostly (and other cryptos after that date)."

"But definitely not Bcash: ""Now take this one integer and change it. commit! new hard fork!"""
"There was a specific verb you used there: ""scaling"". Bcash didn't address that, it delayed the inevitable. Bcash is a scam for non techies that will run into the same wall that BTC is actually addressing in production already through LN and Segwit. Bcash is literally BTC 6+ months ago with 1 integer changed."
If you mean that newer experimetnal technologies have appeared in the ecosystem then I'm sure there is a lot of experiments going on. But for me Bitcoin doesn't start and finish with the technological aspect... for me Bitcoin a genius consensus system leveraged on technology to maintain an equilibrium of incentives. I'm not interested in the change of the technology for the sake of it, but for evolving that system, respecting the spirit behind its inception, its incentives system, the proved POW mechanism, and make them work better without changing them fundamentally, which is the opposite of what Core was perpetrating with the old Bitcoin, poor old Bitcoin.
Ok,my opinion now nothing really to back it up with, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream have squandered their 1st mover advantage by their intransigent and obdurate refusal to promptly address the scaling requirements and instead have proffered complexity and complexity to deal with an issue that should have been dealt with in a common sense manner. Their not so well hidden agendas have destroyed the speed and cost advantage and with it the value of Bitcoin Core. On August 1st 2017 Bitcoin Cash picked up Satoshi's vision and moved forward. Bitcoin Core is a failing experiment and as more people become aware of the limitations and compromises that the core solutions entail the wiser heads will be leaving quietly and making other arrangements. You can fool some of the people some of the time and Bitcoin Core has been counting on that for a while the rest of us who won't be fooled have already moved on. In my opinion, Bitcoin is irrelevant and this is soley because of the Core Devs actions over the last 4 year span. They have destroyed the essential utility of Bitcoin and perhaps that was what they were paid to do.
I just logged in and bought some more because we are oversold. The closer we get to tax time the worse things will get I think but I am getting what I like now and will wait this out until next year because year over year gains matter not day over day.
"It's pretty ignorant to think that this is the end. speaking about no coin in specific, the leaders of block chain projects - real projects with goals, not shit coins - aren't as pressed about the ""price"" of a token or coin as the ignorant masses that bought these astoundingly unsustainable all time highs. Most people that got in for a quick buck or moon lambos got burned, the rest don't care because that's just how markets move."
I guessed when I bought in on August 1 2017, I guessed when I bought Ethereum in 2016, I guessed when I bought Bitcoin in 2013, I don't know what else am I supposed to do? I guess that if I have a 3 year time line all of this will even out and I will be in more profits. Unless everything goes to zero I am pretty much in a NO LOSE situation. I bought yesterday and bought today, if the prices continue downward I am buying tomorrow. I am not smart enough to trade. I am smart enough however to buy a downturn and wait. More people should do that. If you can't you are investing money you shouldnt.
Everyone was saying to buy everything.

"> Bcash didn't address that, it delayed the inevitable.

If you mean Bitcoin Cash, it does address the scaling theme in the way it was supposed to be since the beginning, the way it works, because there never was a scaling problem.  Bitcoin Cash devs are developing many interesting technologies for making sure of that there wont ever be a scaling problem at all (graphene, subchains, weakblocks, etc.).

Only there is a scaling problem for BTC, because Core made sure of that, by artificially crippling the system and spreading FUD regarding ""centralization concerns"", like if there were no bigger concerns in the centralization of the development by a malicious or incompetent dev team.

> A scam for non techies

That would be BTC, with its censored, non-transparent community where no technical discussions or any kind of criticism is allowed, with all the propaganda and the kool-aid people drink there like if it was milk and honey.

> BTC is actually addressing in production already through LN & Segwit

Bad pre-alpha hyper-complex technology that isn't intended as a scaling system and that wont work as advertised, with many problems of its own, mainly on routing and security, and that fundamentally changes the incentives system and the network topology that Bitcoin had to a much more vulnerable and centralized one.

> Bcash is literally BTC 6+ months ago with 1 integer changed.

If you mean Bitcoin Cash, you are literally lying.

''delaying the inevitable'' its funny you used that phrase because its something I have used to describe Bitcoin Cores ballistic arc development trajectory.  The upside is over for Bitcoin Core, all that remains now is to see where it lands.
"Infinite growth is possible but human nature makes us look at timescales that are relevant to us. Slow growth might be sustainable but as an investor class crypto enthusiasts have been spoiled by multi digit gains. ADHD Investors want things quickly and if its not happening they get disappointed and move on.  $100k Bitcoin with $5000 transaction fees is useless. I think that Bitcoin is going to get the Coup De Grace from China when they Nationalise all Bitcoin Miners as a strategic asset and force miners to use their Hash Power to secure the Digital Yuan or Digital Renimbi.  This I think will happen
It makes too much sense not to. Cripple your rival and strengthen your own version. People invested in Bitcoin should take a longer view "
52 x 10 = $520 per year its not an amount that you will miss one way or the other. If you keep doing that over a few years you will wind up going I should have put more in (LOL) strange but true. Crypto will make you look for ways to save to invest.

Poor kid, he just wanted some milk instead of hard questions. 
Tax time is coming and some people are still booking profits even in this market. For the rest of us this is a gut check,are you really committed to the technology? As long as you are not over invested and are still relatively liquid you can ignore this and move on to other things secure in the knowledge this will blow over and growth will continue at some point. Might be 2 years from now might be three months. No one can really say. I bought in and am glad I did.

What was the name of the youtube channel? Are there anywhere I could find these videos so I could archive them? I have a video archive of videos like this, just for entertainment and historic purposes.
I'm not following these stats, LN is still in test phase, just some are using it already in mainnet, but now i had a little time to check the charts, and [this clearly shows](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-transactions-btc.html#1y) in the past year there was no exact correlation between the tx numbers and the fee, the fee's dropped even with constant usage and increased later, there have been over 350k tx's with the highest fee, and dropping usage didn't essentially lowered the fee's. It is partly true less usage will lower fees because of less race condition for confirmations, but a lot of other things will affect it too. For example if often used services overpay the tx, then it will cause high fees, and a lot of services doesn't let the users set the fee, because it is calculated automatically, and sometimes very badly. For example last year in the blockchain.info wallet the default tx fee was a few times more than what was needed, ok there is an option to set it by yourself, but a lot of people didn't know that (later they changed the all fee setting form). So in nutshell, the fees can drop by lower usage, and by other things too, it's not definitely a strict connection.
"Ok, I'd like some modifications which I'm not really well qualified to do myself, but would happily cut a deal to get done (either by myself or hiring someone else to do them):

1. Make the T-Rex hold a bunch of credit cards in a fold-out wallet, and maybe some fiat cash or gold bullion in the other claw

2. Make the meteors a green hue (may require altering the sky hue generally), remove the BS ring logo, put the Bitcoin Cash green tilted Bitcoin symbol in the middle and maybe a ring of text around the inside edge of the meteor saying 'low fees', 'reliable confirmations'.

3. Make the squirrels hodl orange BTC (let's face it, these particular ones aren't going to live long)

If someone made this, how much of a cut would you want out of future money made on it? Of course, if you could make such an 'alternate version' it would probably turn out way better :-)"

I’m not an expert on dinosaurs. But they are highly suspicious.  Often the paleontologist constructs a whole gigantic dinosaur out of a couple teeth and one bone. It’s called using their imagination.  Look into it. It’s fascinating. So many conspiracies, so little time.  I’ll admit dinosaurs are not in my wheelhouse. Maybe one day. 
Wow! Thank you so much!
Thank you!
"> So basically you're saying that BCH is a short term solution correct? It doesn't solve the problem but it reduces it without much effort. 

No, I think BCH is a long-term solution. There is no going back from that fork. BTC shed community and developers and they coalesced around BCH.

We can scale on-chain using BCH for a very long time before we would absolutely need to use secondary layers, that fact is why so many are upset with Core for trying to force everyone onto layer-2 solutions prematurely.

Lmao. So rare and expensive that they’re not safe in a museum right?  And not to mention where is the market for these things?  Is there any?  Give me a break. Absolute hoax. 
"Your chart is showing transaction price in USD overlaid on transaction volume, but you're using it to draw conclusions for transaction price in sat/byte relative to transaction volume.  

If you look at a [chart showing the transaction fee in sat/byte](https://bitcoinfees.info/) (second on the page), you can actually see it almost mirror the transaction volume chart 1:1, with the dips in transaction volume corresponding to a dip in transaction fee, and a spike in transaction volume corresponding to a spike in transaction fee.

I really do not believe in dinosaurs. In fact. I believe that many ‘dinosaur’ bones are not only regular mammal animal bones, but often the bones of real life human giants as described in the Bible - giants once roamed the earth. The evidence of Giants is covered up swiftly and never taught since it helps verify the claims of the Bible.

"> Show me a phone that you can buy today that doesn't receive SMS

Mine. It is proprietary and is hard coded at the kernel level to not work if you do not pay the bill."
that is not spoofing your number
Oh them! Thanks a lot for posting the screenshot, it makes it easier to visualize. 
Fault may lie with the spoof a text idea ...
This can't be spoofed. You can spoof what shows up on the recipient's phone, but not what the API sees and or what the bot does. Already been tested, but thanks for confirming!
Actually you don't even need to clone the SIM. It is quite easy to sign up for API access with any number of SMS companies (e.g. Nexmo) and send SMS with whatever sender number you want.
"How can every transaction possibly occur on-chain without you giving your private keys to Cointext?

If you receive money using Cointext you presumably want to spend it using Cointext. If they send it to your on-chain address then they must also know the private key to that address in order for you to be able to spend it.

So even if it's ""on-chain"" it's still putting your coins under Cointext's control."
"This will be fine for the 5 billion unbanked where an entire village might share one flip-phone. With this tech, they can send and receive payments, it means access to the global economy at last, without the gatekeeping money-leeching banks.

It may not be perfect, but it's a start. Later, they can add in enhanced security features. I can easily imagine encrypting texts using the the rolling seed of a 2FA authenticator. By this means, even texting can be made relatively secure, and it just has to be setup in person once."

Also, picture this: you can send BCH to anyone in the world who owns a mobile phone, even without installing a wallet, even without knowing how cryptos work, even without having anything to do to receive.

Yes, this is a game changer."

It was first proposed to use in Bitcoin in 2013, but Core refused to work on it.
Oh alright, just treat it like money. Thanks.
The idea is that someone just goes through the process of switching an old phone number to a new device. You'll probably need basic information on the person like name, address, and last four digits of SSN. This process might vary by carrier. I don't recall receiving a notice when I did it for my personal phone number.
"Check the links in the bot's comment. You can also randomly tip people like this u/tippr 0.0002018 BCH
"
"> countries where a smartphone is luxury.

Which countries are these? How large is their population? How likely are they to care about crypto? 

"
"All it takes is for this to start seeing any level of traction and every SMS gateway operator will have at least one rogue employee sniffing SMS traffic looking for gullible marks to steal from.
"
Lol oh okay so if you don't have a cellular subscription you don't get texts? Yes you're right about that.
See comment below. You, of course, are a troll anyways who doesn't give a shit about BCH, so I'm sure you're just trolling.
If you want to use SMS for something, it should be for delivering signed transactions from payer to payee. 
Explain how it can't be spoofed? Is the wallet linked to an individual device, or to a phone number? How does the system deal with a cloned sim?
We just need to get them connected enough that they can authenticate to us who they are and what their situation is. That's all it'll take to bootstrap them very quickly. Imagine a serious authenticated post where we all have serious reason to believe it where someone's saying, seriously I'm in a poor country and I can't afford a smart phone and I need $10 so I can get a phone. We'd chip in and get that person a phone, no problem. The prices of phones are plummeting and our ability to collaborate to distribute them is zooming, they're going to cross so quickly.
okay
seriusly? there are no cheaper contracts? for x free SMS? i thought thats standard by now because noone is using them anymore..
Either you did it wrong or this is a lie. It is not possible to tell whether an SMS is spoofed.
I never knew this bot could do that, I need to set that up later!
You're right. I don't think they're that far along ( could be wrong though ) but it's a start!

"People keep saying that and while true you sound like a gumpy old person that refuses to see the bigger picture. 

I'm 100% BCH."
"That's the idea, yeah :)

With the difference that it's incredibly easy to transact over the internet, no accounts, no permissions.

Like u/tippr $1"
agreed, WhatsApp would be huge too!
they would have to have a phone that is on, or an app that lets them receive texts, if they shut off any ability to dl new apps it would be a no go ...
[deleted]
Explain to the people that don’t know just how easily your phone can be hijacked... Like how it’s actually done and what to look out for on the device if they have already done so. 
"> average

"Is this how you speak to your coworkers? Accuse them of lying the instant something doesnt fit to your expectation?

You are not wrong. But...."
"Okay. I spent my own money to buy 5 messages on this website: https://www.spoofmytextmessage.com/spoof-text-messages

I then inserted my own phone number as the spoofed number. I inserted the Cointext number as the recipient number. I had ""Send $.1 XXXXXXXXXX"" as the message, where XXXXXXXXXX is a phone number of another individual with me.

I never got a message that something had been sent, and the individual next to me didn't get a message either."
Cell phones are not security devices. 
This is true but it's a bigger problem than crypto. People rely on cell phones for lots of things. Presidents of countries tweet on their cell phones and their tweets can move whole markets zillions of dollars.
With my carrier I did this entirely on line by logging into the carrier web site.
"You could start by explaining to us how you spoofed the number.

Given that 2 hours ago you didn't even know it was possible, I stand by what I said: either you did it wrong or it's a lie."
"So your have two simcards of the same number, with one on a cloned sim, and you sent the text from the cloned sim phone. 

Is this what you are saying?"
"The probability that my coworkers are trying to scam people is much lower than the probability that some random dude on reddit is trying to scam people.

Especially when talking about cryptocurrency, and *especially* when making claims that are technical impossibilities.

I don't think there's much to be gained by being polite to these people."
The solution is simple. Don't give out your phone number. /s
u/TragicallyHopeful This could be easily prevented with a simple confirmation SMS to the phone number used as the sending one.
They banned ads for ICOs because the majority of them were scams. I don't see how that would affect a WhatsApp bot at all. 
"> Every phone can natively receive SMS

Bullshit"
"According to the largest list [here], the only countries with a yearly average income lower than $730 (or $2 daily) are the Central African Republic and perhaps Somalia. Hardly ""countless"".

$2 per day is the very definition of extreme poverty by the World Bank, if I'm not mistaken. Luckily, thanks to all progress brought by capitalism and globalization, only a small percentage of the World population still lives by such extreme standards. 

In the greatest majority of countries (poor countries!), smartphones are commonplace. Far from ""luxury"". And not that I don't want to help these other few places where smartphones might actually be hard to access, it's just that I really don't think it will happen before BCH is well used and has a large network effect outside of these places. What's the percentage of people living on these extreme low wages that is actually literate enough to use this app?

Investing time and effort on SMS today to me sounds like a waste of resources."
"You said yourself that 1/2 of them are smartphones, so they're definitely not a ""luxury"" as the other poster said. And you're talking about very poor places. So, why even bother about SMS at all?"
"Ideally you can sell goods or services for BCH. Otherwise you can exchange them for fiat, like you would exchange USD for EUR, on one of the major exchange sites, eg. Coinbase or localbitcoincash.

If you have a top end graphics card, you can mine some altcoins and exchange them for BCH (or whatever you prefer). If you're a content creator, you can post your content on a site like yours.com

"
You can buy Bitcoin and the other major alt coins like Bitcoin Cash, Etherium or Lite coin from an exchange. Or you can sell goods/services online and receive coins as payment directly to your wallet. 
Ok that makes sense, thanks!
SMS can be spoofed and is sent in the clear. It's pretty much like  like writing a check, making a paper airplane, throwing it, and wandering why it's not secure.
"Okay... I sent a text to the phone number in the screenshot while spoofing my own phone number. I send ""Send $0.1 XXXXXXXXXX"". Nothing happened.

Not sure how I can prove that to you, but I'm 90% sure I did it correctly."
No. It was two numbers.
"This would be a little annoying from a usability perspective though as compared to how it works now.

I am waiting for another confirmation on my payment to go through to buy some spoofs (they take BCH!), then I will test this and see what happens."
Interesting... I'll see what happens and report back.
"What about adding a 2FA on the SMS from a pre-configured google authenticator that the user has set at the first registration?

Something like: ""Send $0.50 5448675309 436375"" -> [SEND] [AMOUNT] [NUMBER] [2FA]

Sure, google authenticator app isn't available on old phones..."
"One of my banks blocks sms-based authentication for a couple of days whenever I get a new SIM for the *same* mobile number. So there are SIM-coupled origin checks possible it seems...

I gather my bank does this to thwart social engineering tricks mentioned elsethread, but I surmise it would help against this SMS origin spoofing too."
Could you elaborate on that? I guess i dont know why it would or wouldnt be secure. Thank you. 
"Then work on something else.

This is anything but a waste of resources."
It is owned by Facebook, who just banned crypto... not so sure if this comes soon.
Every phone can natively receive SMS. The phone can be off as well.
"These people are part of your/my/our community.

We can spare some time to play nice.  Huge difference if a known bad actor shows up and starting painting a story, then fair game."
There are countless countries where individuals make less than $2 a day. This is EXACTLY what these countries need.
Homework :)
It was the only plan available that wouldn't cut internet after I used too many bytes, just slow it down.

It couldn't, you obviously need to give the private keys to Cointext. It's effectively an online wallet that can be controlled through sms."

This is not a security focused wallet. Those who value maximum security have other options. It's still secure enough and useful on a bunch of levels.

"I'll test it out. What do you mean by spoof my number?

So far I've found it just doesn't do anything if I send the number in a wrong format. For example:

""Send (544) 867-5309"" didn't work (I just didn't get a response), but ""Send 5448675309"" worked."
"What I see here is some spectacular upvoting by Blockstream bots who work with you. Every positive Bitcoin Cash news is the same, a  negative comment gets top spot every time. And the cherry on the cake,  you complain about vote manipulation while you do that... endless projection, the same script every time.

The masters of deception, not good for anything else. Amazing.

So, who wants to put their savings in the hands of these people? No one. Can't wait to see the mania end.

I believe the biggest motivator here is for tiny transactions, like cents. Any sort of attack would need to spoof thousands of numbers to be worth a mac flurry.
Obviously this is for small amounts.

if someone was watching when you set your stupid pin, they can have 50 cheap clones of your phone. or if you used a common 4 digit number that someone could easily guess if they know you, they have a copy of your phone.

Tippr holds the keys to any funds I send or receive and I must request withdrawal. But we call Tippr bot ""off-chain"", although technically anything transacting on the blockchain and not on a secondary layer would be on-chain. "
Is that possible elsewhere in the world? I was under the impression only the US had the system setup such that the phone companies were not responsible for defining who the message or phone call came from...

Looks good, but needs a telegram/WhatsApp version, here in Europe SMS went away with the Nokia brick phones, most people use WhatsApp. I don't remember sending a SMS message in the last 7 years.
Hi do you have a website/twitter that one can look at for more information?
I just tested that out. It didn't work for what it's worth.
You have to remember at that point both people know the private key, and could lead to fraud. 
"If you don't hold the private keys, you're not banking yourself. They need to study the possibility of SIM-card apps; there is not much in a way of GUI I think, just text menus provided by phone's OS, but they can run on pretty much any phone; the key thing I don't know, is whether they can write to the phone's storage to be able to save and backup private keys in case something happens to the SIM-card. I'm not sure you can install those without making a deal with the carrier though."

This is their killer app! Hope it is secure enough.  Can we test it through?
Yep, it is. One of the biggest complains I heard is having to depend on a smartphone and risk of using one in public here. So this is definitely a game changer.
