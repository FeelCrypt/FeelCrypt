it can scale on Bitcoin (BSV)
Thanks dad
"As I said, I explained *why* I thought they decided to use strict moderation policies.  I never explicitly advocated it.  I think what Roger Ver is doing is worse, and more eyeballs see his propaganda every day than the bitcoin subreddit.

Hell, bitcoin.com ranks even higher than bitcoin.org on web analytic rankings.  You'd think with all that traffic, and the complete and utter lies Roger publishes on that site, that he would have tricked more people into buying BCH.  Thankfully, for the most part, people seem to see through his fraudulent tactics and outright scams, and that's why BCH will never succeed beyond a small niche group use of angry anti-Bitcoin ignoramuses."
Yes, as I said, I explained *why* they decided to censor.

Yes, because a different opinion is an attack."
