Microsoft is using Bitpay as a payment processor. As far as what they do with the currency they receive isn't public knowledge. They may convert it all to USD, or they may hang on to some, we don't know.

"I was under the impression that BitPay converted all funds to Fiat before the merchant ever sees the currency. 

I assumed this was the case because that's how the BitPay card works. If you add BCH to your BitPay card, you're simply selling your BCH at the current exchange rate and putting that much fiat on your BitPay card. "
Wait I thought bitpay would send fiat to the merchant after receiving crypto? Is it actually just pure crypto-crypto transaction?

Thanks for showing a picture of what you actually got.  I hate all the I got pizza for BCH but no picture.  Well, let's see the dang pizza then.  I know it sounds like I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not. It makes it more real to see what you got than just some transaction id.
"Kirby's Q in Alstead, NH. Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area!

I don't know that I have noticed much hating on other cryptos around here, but I am glad to see so much love for good ribs.

I think Monero and Dash and Zcash and Ripple are all interesting projects. I just can't use any of them to cost-effectively buy ribs, and doubt I'll be able to anytime soon. They all are neat ideas though."
'preciate it. :-)
"Nah, hodl is lame. Spend and replace is where it's at. It's a crypto*currency*.

Plus, if you're in the red, if you spend and replace you can harvest tax losses, saving on your tax bill, without losing any of your position size.* And if you're in the green, you still come out ahead, even after taxes.

(*Check with your tax accountant.)"
It's for everyone with good taste, wherever that may lead them.
Are these baby back ribs or  side ribs?
"Not necessarily.

1) If I understand correctly, they commit to instantly buy the BCH from their business with USD cash from their personal accounts, so there is no capital gain or loss to report on their business taxes. (They are the kind of people who believe in the project and actually want Bitcoin for themselves, so that works nicely for some people.)

2) If you prefer to just cash out into USD right away, using BitPay will let you do that for a 1% fee instantly. Again, no capital gain or loss to report if I understand correctly. You can effectively accept BCH but receive dollars if that's your preference.

3) It's really not hard to use software to track your net gains/losses and cost basis on Bitcoin if you are actively trading in and out of it with USD. This is especially easy if you use something like Coinbase, but there are plenty of third party solutions these days. It's no harder than the tracking your stock trades or rebalances.

I'm not a tax attorney, so double check all that for yourself, but that's my understanding of it. Not hard at all."
Tracking isn't hard at all if you use a portfolio tracker like CoinTracking.info. Link your wallet (transaction history) to the service and CoinTracking automatically does all of the calculations for you. And they'll even provide you with a nice little report for the taxman.
"Still can. That's why you spend and replace. That way you can have your BCH and eat with it too.

The only way BCH gets to the kind of value youre hoping for is if people actually *use* it.

So if you want it to ""moon"" sooner, go out and spend-and-replace some. You have the power to help increase adoption and value."
"I'm sorry, but I did get a coffee while there too.

\#Sorrynotsorry."
A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a penny, just like BCH transactions always do. Effectively negligible.
That was probably a XL pizza with this big hash, or maybe pizza and hot wings
Thinking about this... it just occurred to me that crypto would be a harder sell down here in NC.   All the real BBQ joints are cash only..   so they wouldn't really have anything to gain by using crypto.
I think the whole crypto community (mostly litecoin and bch) should come together and do a universal listing of places accepting cryptos. Practically everyone wins. The advertisers, the customers, and crypto as a whole.
coinmap.org is an excellent site, but its only btc. bout time someone made bchmap.org
"Ah, I am the OP :)

I'm a small business owner and freelancer myself, so my taxes are already fairly complex, so I don't mind. 

But even if I wasn't, everything from answer #3 still applies. It's really just not that hard to automatically track those things these days!

If you're savvy, I imagine you can even intelligently use tax loss harvesting by trading cryptos when they're all down to lower your tax burden, so there are potential pluses there too.

But I'd also imagine that many crypto users aren't going to bother reporting, just like most waiters' tips went largely unreported for most of modern history until pretty recently.

I can understand that. On a moral level, income and capital gains taxes are forceful, unnecessary, corrosive, and shouldn't exist. (But I still pay them anyway as a prudential matter, because for me, the costs of not doing so would be far higher than I'm willing to bear.) 

This all goes doubly so when we're talking about so-called ""gains"" on forms of money, and it's nice to see that some states are already introducing legislation to remove capital gains on gold and silver. The same should be done for cryptocurrencies.

In the meantime, no, I'm no more concerned about it than I am concerned about reporting my stock trades. It's all pretty easily and automatically tracked these days."
"It could also be subject to a capital loss if you were to make a purchase when cryptos were down, no?

I've heard that cryptos are not subject to wash sale rules, which would mean that using the ""spend and replace"" strategy when cryptos are down could potentially *save* you in taxes by allowing you to declare losses--even if your effective position size in BCH remains the same.

I imagine it might also might be a good strategy to trade out of one type of crypto into another when they're both down, thereby harvesting a tax loss that you can use to offset other passive income. (If so, it could be a great time to switch from BTC to BCH if you're in the red, or otherwise diversify your holdings.)

Ultimately, there should be no capital gains taxes on currencies, whether fiat or crypto or precious metals, so I'm glad to see those laws being proposed. (Ideally, there's be no capital gains or income taxes, period, like for most of American history, but hey, I'll take one small victory at a time.)

In the meantime, tax loss harvesting seems like a potential silver lining.

I'd want to  check with a tax attorney first, but it's worth exploring. Even if you had to wait a 30 day period to avoid wash sale rules, it could be a sensible strategy in a bear market where you expect the trend to be down or flat for a while. But I don't think that waiting period currently applies to cryptos. Please correct me if I'm wrong."
Instant. 0-conf. All transactions make it to the next block. I've never heard of a BCH transaction that wasn't effectively instant for these purposes.
"I think the whole reddit community should come together and do a list of people who get's angry and call people ""nigger"" and ""faggot"" when people say that pedophilia is wrong, i'll start with /u/SniperJF"
It is good but doesn’t support iOS 
"Not really though. BTC would have cost me significantly more at the time, and if there was still a lot of usage on the network, it would have cost me crazily more.

You could argue ""but lightning network"". However, LN is not yet merchant ready, and if it were, onboarding merchants would probably be comparatively tricky and intimidating. (Not to mention the questions about LN security and vulnerability to attack in an open network with malicious actors.)

Barring unforeseen circumstances, I've switched over to BCH for good. Transactions are easy, fun, instant and basically free. It's even orders of magnitude cheaper to use than Dash, which I also like."
These days both BTC and BCH are super fast and easy. 
St. Louis ribs. I believe that means side ribs.

I also sold all my BTC near the top when it was clear it had become broken, and converted it all to BCH, USD cash, precious metals, and fairly-priced international stocks.

"I used coinmap.org which tracked places that accept the legacy BTC ticker symbol. 

I then reached out to a bunch of places in my area that accepted BTC, and asked if they'd accept my BCH too. Literally *all* of them said yes.

I’m just saying the mempool is clear these days. The only reason you pay less is because satoshis in BCH are cheaper because the coin has less value in fiat. 
"Thanks, I got them from https://bchsticker.com

You've gotta have a little side of green when having ribs. That's just the way that works."
Those ribs look really nice! There should be a map with dots that goes to stories and pictures of BCH IRL sales. 
"Even if BCH was worth 10x or 100x or 1,000x as much as it is now, one satoshi would still be a fraction of a fraction of a penny. It would still be effectively free to send.

Sadly, the major reason the BTC mempool is down is that usage fell off a cliff after it effectively became broken.

Meanwhile, if BCH ever experienced transaction volumes far greater than BTC has ever had, it would still be effectively instant and free, every single time."
lmao if you're willing to pay your pizza with BTC, sure why the f*** not :)

"> Then only spend your old coins and keep the young ones to ""mature"", problem solved.

If you're doing fifo (first in, first out) to determine the age of the sold coins, then that works only as long as you don't day-trade too much.

"> However, I'm wondering how BCH coins which you receive from holding BTC throughout the fork are being taxed.

Look at it like a stock split: the date of acquisition is the date of the acquisition of the prefork coin. Price of acquisition is the ""first market price"", about €260 for BCH (incidentally BTC dropped by roughly that amount at fork point).

Technically it would be even more accurate to take the acquisition price of the pre-fork coin and ""distribute"" that to the 2 post-fork coins using the ratio of the market prices at fork time, but I think the first method will be acceptable to the taxman and it's advantageous to have a higher acquisition price for the BTC, of course."
