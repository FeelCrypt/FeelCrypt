Well, adoption. You want adoption, as payment or currency. But you don‚Äôt own any to buy anything with it. Non sense. Charlie lee is the ultimate scammer, perfect character to brainwash all this millennial pc snowflake generation. LTC is worthless no use case, nothing good about it, just some funny guy writing trendy coolio stuff online promoting it for the millennials sheep to follow. It worked and is working still it seems. 
Ltc came first and it is faster. It took 40 minutes to get one confirmation when I transferred bch from coinbase to binance. Binance doesn't accept 0 confirmations. Ltc has never taken that long for me. They are both first gen coins and shouldn't call the other coin pointless. Ltc is willing to increase the block size if needed. Both coins believe in low cost transactions.
"As a single individual he can do way more for LTC by promoting it, than using it ever would. Also, you don‚Äôt know if he is using it or not. He may be even if he doesn‚Äôt hold any significant amounts. It‚Äôs a strawman to say he‚Äôa not. 

LTC can do everything BCH can and more. It is faster in terms of blocks and more decentralized. It can do LN too. It has a bigger market cap, has 3x more transactions, 3x more value, has 3x more active addresses. It‚Äôs better in all metrics. 

Sorry if it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative, but facts are facts."
Lmao idiot, Charlie has LTC and uses it to buy stuff today, he‚Äôs just not an investor he‚Äôs a user of the currency DYOR before u pull shit out of ur ass ü§£
How is it hypocritical?

Even after the creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, sold Majority of his LTC, it has a higher market cap than BCH. BCH has bitmain, roger, and others buying and holding. Are Roger, bitmain and others selling to get out of this shitcoin called BCH? is that the reason why BCH has lost like 99% of its value?
Very funny fanboy. Send me his wallet address if you know he is using ltc for what is meant for. He‚Äôs very good at technical analysis. 
Follow him on twitter, you seem very emotional about this he has shared stuff he bought with LTC lol
