"I can;t believe how far we've come in such a short time... completely amazing to look back even 3 or 4 years and see the difference in the landscape."
i agree completely, if this goes any where near potential we are still in early days.
"I remember reading that on Slashdot and thinking, oh great, nerd money. Then I read Andreas Antonopoulos'es Mastering Bitcoin think this is the greatest invention since C. Then I got lazy and didn't buy any earlier this year.
"
i think anyone that get in now will do great as well, still early days.

I must have missed the part about the terrible EDA feature.

"**Annus Mirabilis papers**

The Annus mirabilis papers (from Latin annus mīrābilis, ""extraordinary year"") are the papers of Albert Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four articles contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, mass, and energy. The annus mirabilis is often called the ""miracle year"" in English or Wunderjahr in German.

"I thought it was interesting at $4, mined a bit on an old laptop, thought it was dumb, stopped before mining before enough for a payout on Slushpool, opened a Coinbase account in 2012 because hey I can buy some of those Bitcoin thingies... verification process too hard, quit... started buying Bitcoin at $400.

Do you think most people can and will get in?  Or will most people have very low bitcoin accounts, like they have low fiat accounts?

"Well that is the rub though, if (when) the fiat economy collapses, then cryptocurrencies are only worth what they will buy.

I understand what you mean that many simply won't have access to be in early, but this tech will eventually improve their lives by creating a much more fair economic matrix where upward mobility is possible. 

Though, the road there will likely be a bumpy one for many. "
Wouldn't the coins in Satoshi's addresses have been moved in that case? Can't we tell if that happens or has happened?
The coins haven't moved and he has enough (given the current price) to crash the market if he wanted to
None of his coins have ever moved that we're aware of besides the early transactions. He may have had a lot more coins in anonymous address but an estimated 1,000,000 coins that are allegedly his have never moved. 
Most American's don't even have any savings.  Billions don't have electricity.  If fiat collapses even more economic loss will be incurred.  Its unlikely the masses will have spare cash to pay for an experimental speculative asset.
"I feel like there is no way that David Chaum was not involved on some level, if not his research at least. His pedigree is exactly what Bitcoin would have required, and he was one of the earliest to work on digital currencies and pioneered a lot of cryptographic tech as well.

Not that it matters anyway, but speculating is fun"
I think Satoshi knew Hal and maybe Mike. Possibly even contributed under his name and shot the shit in the ideas phase with Satoshi. I don't think they are the man, the myth, the legend tho.... But they are legends in their own right.
He had a very expensive disease, people assume he liquidated to pay his medical bills.
"**Hal Finney (computer scientist)**

Harold Thomas Finney II (May 4, 1956 – August 28, 2014) was a developer for PGP Corporation, and was the second developer hired after Phil Zimmermann. In his early career, he was credited as lead developer on several console games. He also was an early bitcoin user and received the first bitcoin transaction from bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

You're saying the bitcoin outlined in Satoshi's whitepaper isn't bitcoin?
"Mike Hearn is the best candidate I came up with, but definitely can't rule out Hal. As noted in the link below, Mike and Hal were corresponding just months before the Bitcoin release on Trusted Computing.

**Bitcoin**: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System
"[The whitepaper had a pre-release](https://www.keyois.com/information/what-is-bitcoin/pre-release-of-whitepaper/?v=a284e24d5f46) or version before the one you know.

Satoshi wrote some people in Summer 2008 to ask them advice and gave them a draft copy of the whitepaper which didn't have the word 'bitcoin' in it.

No surviving copies of this paper are known to exist, but the abstract is still known.

>***Friday, August 22, 2008***


>Title: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party Abstract: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution. Digital signatures offer part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.


As the specification for Bitcoin, the whitepaper has a lasting historical significance, it details what Bitcoin is."
"Fun fact: If you quote Satoshi on /r/bitcoin it's very likely auto moderator will immediately remove your post. Don't believe me? Try it, find a relevant bit of writing from Satoshi and quote it (and only the quote, nothing else) in a relevant way. Then log out and see what happened to it. It might be gone. Their  auto moderator rules change all the time but I have discovered from experience that 80% of me directly quoting Satoshi is immediately removed)

Anybody from /r/bitcoin reading this, if you don't believe me .... try it yourself. "

and looking forward to see where we are in 3 or 4 years. this is still early days.
"Check this out - 

http://mapofcoins.com/

You get a real sense of how this space has absolutely exploded since Bitcoin lit the 1st genesis block. And judging by the the fact 100s of new altcoins seem to be created every day now, that is only accelerating"
In the long term Bitcoin can only be good if it distributes wealth better than fiat.
"> ""If this is what I think it is, the implications are huge!""

the white paper that changed the world
"That white paper may well be the most important document ever created in modern history. The first massive shakeup of our financial and governance processes for 100s of years. Sometimes I wonder if even Satoshi had realized the scope of their invention at the time. On the back of a few pages, the decentralized economy of Machine Age is being born.

Big happy birthday to the Bitcoin ideology, its been a wild ride since I first discovered it a few years ago, which gave me the first hope for the future in a very long time. It gave me purpose and clarity to become a blockchain software developer myself after a long stint in IT (now a CS major!). The best is yet to come no matter how things play out. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are only living proof that Satoshi's invention is working as intended."
you must have have a lot of bitcoins
If Satoshi is real, they certainly know what they did. 
"I love Satoshis paper, it changed my life, however we shouldn’t jump to “the most important document created  of modern times”; Einstein’s 1905 papers are up there, especially the mass energy equivalence one. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers"
"That they left as soon as the CIA started sniffing around is enough for me that they knew what was going on when they started. 

I always wondered about Satoshi during the start before Hal Finney became interested. What kind of disheartening did they experience when the nerdiest of the nerds didn't even grasp what was going on. "
Isnt this it https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Essay:Bitcoin:_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System
"Also, wei dais b money is not referenced, nor is bitgold or hashcash, Satoshi didn't know about these.

does that 'removing the tail' idea change the concepts in the wp?

**u/digital_del** - I'd enjoy hearing any updated analysis you have on Tethers.  What do you think, for example, about **u/gopnikRU** 's [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79oozw/i_opened_my_eyes/) that someone may have created $25,000,000 unbacked Tether a few days ago to artificially inflate BTC's price?
