Then i hope he's doing that right now. Wouldn't count on it though.
"that ltc has nothing special, that whatever crypto you're for is a special snowflake crypto that you've given no backing to and a reason why.
"
"> Then the mod (very mistakenly) labeled a potential fork of Bitcoin as an alt? Is that correct?

Yes. not rationally though. I was banned for saying Bitcoin XT can't be an altcoin, as it writes valid bitcoin transactions to the blockchain that are considers valid by the bitcoin network. 

Talking about implementations that removed the 1MB limit was banned, only if it was officially on-topic acording to the Core mailing list and IRC was it allowed (excluding cat videos and price speculation) . (rules there also prohibited the discusion of a >1MB fork where moderated on the IRC and even bitcointalk.org aswell.) 

Only implementations that followed the the lead implementation rules set was allowed, the notion of a single official implementation is the very definition of centralized control. Ways to remove the 1MB limit involving old nodes to upgrade was banned. 

I was initially banned for 1 year for criticizing the censorship (after my first two infractions). My first ban was for promoting the idea of increasing the transaction capacity, I was sensitive to the notion one could not discuss XT. I was also banned for down voting a comment by nullc - i clicked on a link from r/btc and the reddit admin banned everyone, reddit wide for down voting nullc. 

>In that case, that Mod is the problem. I don't think they were purposefully being malicious though. 

botoin.org,
Bitcoin IRC
bitcoinwiky,
r/bitcoin,
bitcointalk.org, all censored discussion and projected a vision that was hostile to any implementation other than Core. it looks malicious, its not just r/bitcoin 

>As a side not... why will this sub not let me post any quicker than 4 minutes apart?

reddit had a default setting to prevent toxic trolling, if you are continuously down voted and don't have a positive karma in the sub you are rate limited. that default setting is still active on r/btc. "
"Thanks for that, that's pretty messed up!
It's definitely damaged Bitcoin I would say. 

That kind of explains why the 'mood' in this sub is pretty heavy.

To an outsider, you all (initially) look like a bunch of crazy folk!.
 
However, it's only through r/btc that I read about how powerful the competition had become (from alts)!!. 
How are you supposed to defend your lead, if you can't discuss the competition?!!!

Really weird to think that the future of bitcoin has been jeopardised by one or two 'religious' nuts who control various forums. 







"
"It is crazy, lots of social engendering going on, a lot of the trolls here just agitate and radicalize people banned from r/bitcoin. 

I've noticed that whenever a coherent argument materializes a new bunch of people get banned from r/bitcoin come over here and a bunch of agitators hijack the conversation and derail the conversation. 

what makes this place particularly crazy is there is no heavy moderation, it's all user voting (even voting probably) 

it's not moderated to avoid criticism the idea is this is a free space no moderation, so it's abused. the only moderation tool is the default rate limit. "
If chain growth resulting from block size growth causes problem across the GFC, then (A) perhaps when miners start getting blocks orphaned by an important exchange the problem will resolve quickly (B) maybe miners will feel a need to geographically decentralize or (C) the network can take the hit *at that time* if that day comes.
The fallacy here is that you have the preconceived notion that transaction fees are dependent on the amount of the transaction, which is totally not the case with most cryptocurrencies.
"Its not aboiut small and b blocks , if BTC is unchageble and IN REVERSIBLE that makes it the best as a store of value.
It will not die gold did not die eighter.
this will be virtual gold ,, and a chacn split forget about it , the people resposible have to hide them self for the rest of there lives!
The power of bitcoin is the current status quo :) yes it will be high fees , but if yoiu beed to spend you can use coins like litecoin.
if you need to store you use BTC.
so big blocks will not be needed https://bitcoinfees.21.co/
on chain is not needed because this will come in august,
https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/871755323849154561 no need for any encrease of on chain capasaty.
outside sigwit and BU are a ton of creative solutions.
that will make BTC very easy to transfer to faster but less secure coins
so bitcoin will be $100.000 soon.
 "
 Some sort of incorrectly spelled sausage ? Where can I exchange BTC for these delicious items?
">The new owners will be just like the old, if the limit is not removed. 

*will be*? Bitcoin has always been this bad. There were no ""good old days"". It's just more obvious now."
wat. I just looked data up - it's on topic. It's fun to prove eth shills wrong because eth shills are cancer and entire eth value is based on false marketing of their centralized scam.
"ETH is based on ICOÅ› looks like .com bubble before the pop for me!
It will colapse when ICO turn out to be empty so forget ETH as a replacement for BTC...
it has a different function!
"
we'll see? Ive always understood it to be decentralized. 
Yes I fully agree with that. 
Haha, you are truly ridiculous. Slander is the refuge of the lost. Charlie Lee is that you? 
"If you need to limit bitcoin transaction capacity to make it a reserve currency / asset bitcoin is going to die. 

It's always been that it's not going to change when we remove the transaction limit. 

LN will be backed by Bitcoin - it it needs Bitcoin to be limited in utility its a failed solution. 

TuurDemeester is a small block proponent, he doesn't understand the macro concept of money. and the effects of creating transaction friction. 

the goal is not to wind up like gold the goal is that everyone can settle on the blockchain.  "
"To be fair, the great firewall can partition the network if the block-size rises too fast.
"
"Oh. Well, when you put it like that I guess it totally makes sense to pay a $2 transaction fee on a $20 transaction instead of 40 cents. If only more consumers understood this logic; bitcoin take-up would be through the roof."
"I like this quote :)
""Don't mistake Bitcoin's immutability and censorship resistance for inertia. This is what guarantees its neutrality as a reserve asset.""

https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/874299151726637057

Its  a reserve currency / asset 
"
wire transfers are like $40, and banks along the way can take some of the money. (In Bitcoin the mining fee is known at broadcast time).
"what slander? what did I say that wasn't accurate? name one thing? anything? I provided you sources, links, everything, you just have insults? it's pathetic.

that's the thing about facts, they just are. I don't have any litecoin, I just know more about all crypto in general than you.

I can go into as much detail as you want about 20 other coins better than eth in every way."
