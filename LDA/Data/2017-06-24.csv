My paper analyzes the real bitcoin network and measures the effect there.  Its the mining pool software. If it requests a new block from Satoshi clients and the block cannot be provided (because bitcoind is still DLing the prev block or txns), then the pool SW provides an empty block so the hash power does not sit idle.
"Its how the network works.  Its an unavoidable result of block and txn propagation over a worldwide network whose max speed physically can't exceed about 1/3 light in a vacuum.

Look at block sizes before BU existed or read my paper on the subject. "
"> This sub hates Bitcoin.

But you still come here, because you know deep down it's better."
Okay, well thanks for the info, then.  It is interesting to know that if motivated miners want to prevent excessive block size growth, they at least have the theoretical means to do so.
"Is magnetism an unintentional side effect or an actual feature?  Does intentionality matter?

I'm not sure what cgminer does, but it doesn't really matter anymore.  EC is something else, it doesn't change block size.  You can change the maximum mined block in BU using bitcoin-cli, so you could produce smaller blocks if lots of larger blocks are being created by other miners or vice-versa.  I don't think that that needs to be adjusted automatically,  but if you do you can always write a simple python or shell script to do it.

I hope I've piqued your and other reader's interest about this aspect of the bitcoin network but at this point it'll be more efficient for you to do some googling..."
That's fine.  I believe you, in theory.  I'm just wondering what software actually works to limit the blocksize in that way.  Which mining software makes the actual decision to mine empty blocks when the ideal blocksize is exceeded?  Do any of them actually do that?
No alts, huh?  Then I retract my assertion.  You are reading /r/ethtrader at least.
Is that how BU works?  It mines empty blocks?
Okay, but that seems like more of an unintentional side-effect than an actual feature.  What if I want to solo mine?  Does cgminer, for instance, work the same way?  Does BU refuse to provide blocks when the configured (EC) rate has been exceeded?  Can this feature be added to BU?  Has that been discussed?
