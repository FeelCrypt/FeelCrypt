I thought we were talking about Bitcoin cashy cash, the imaginary one with 1GB blocks. I was never arguing that this was a big risk to Bitcoin cash, which has blocks 8x bigger than Bitcoin. 

Although it seems like there's a miner controlling something like 90% of Bitcoin cash's hash-rate right now, which is insanely dangerous, but I agree that in the long term that would probably sort itself out. With 1GB blocks I don't think it would, not with today's technology prices anyway."

$100K/yr for a critical piece of infrastructure?  Can't tell if serious or trolling.  The number of companies that spend more than this annually on bullshit like game rooms and company retreats is easily enough to power the relay node network.

This doesn't even rise to the level of economic theory, because it only takes into account the preferences of miners and not the actual users of the currency.  It is fundamentally flawed.

Regardless, I grow bored of having the same arguments with you.  Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, not business-to-business.  Individuals should be able to run full nodes.  Not just businesses.

The other interesting question would be how does he transact even with a light wallet? That still needs a fullnode (ideally more than one) to talk to somewhere, and the $100k/yr mentioned before only buys you enough bandwidth to download blocks, not to service connected clients. AFAIK that shouldn't take that much bandwidth, but apparently bloom filters use a lot of other resources (CPU and such). If bitcoin really takes off and there are tens or hundreds of millions of end users with light wallets, will those 45k nodes be able (and willing) to service them all? And will they do it out of the goodness of their hearts, or will they start charging fees?"

You cannot roll back a transaction that was censored. They need to do one or the other."

yes, I agree with you

> the $100k/yr mentioned before only buys you enough bandwidth to download blocks, not to service connected clients

you're gonna need to back that math up better then because that's some expensive bandwidth you got there.

> If bitcoin really takes off and there are tens or hundreds of millions of end users with light wallets, will those 45k nodes be able (and willing) to service them all?

Yes, absolutely.  I think the math shows that a node can service tens of thousands of SPV users if each is making a few transactions per day, 45K nodes scales to a hundreds of millions of users pretty bang-on.  Remember that since most of the transactions propagate quickly through this well-connected node network so they're mostly in the mempool thus the ""block"" is tiny.  The 45K nodes functions as a massively redundant highly decentralized relay server."
"""Fee market"" is not the same thing as ""wanting high fees"".

Market prices encourage efficient usage of a resource.

The solution is to reduce fees by reducing the number of times a user needs to write to the chain. The chain is a precious globally-replicated resource, your coffee purchase shouldn't be stored on my hard disk for ever."
No it won't. It would mean those level transaction costs without lightning networks and Schorr signatures.
"I believe lightning networks are a superior solution and don't want to just take the easy way out and bloat the blockchain as a kludge.

Your subjective feelings about fees are very irrelevant to me.

We both have the same goal: lower fees. I don't believe replicating every trifling transaction for ever in a globally replicated state is a sane tradeoff from an engineering perspective."
"Again, ""Visa levels"" of adoption are (1) a long time away and (2) a good problem to have.

Before we continue I think I should make something obvious.

If Bitcoin should happen to become widely adopted as an investment and / or currency form, meaning ""Visa-like"" adoption, I would expect that a lot of Joe Sixpacks would be using Bitcoin on a payment service, ala Coinbase.  That's not some sort of preference on my part, it's just an observation.

These services will almost surely use Lightning or some similar cryptographically secure channel technology in the wallets they provide to customers because it helps them.  I'm not opposed to payment channel technology offloading work from the blockchain for users who just want a cheaper faster way to pay than what they have today.  I'm just opposed to limiting onchain scaling in order to prop up a fake market for these."

"I was here then. I didn't have a heart attack. 

51% isn't the only attack that Bitcoin is vulnerable against. Limiting the blocksize is another I have learned, but that is another argument.

51% attacks are expensive, even more so for the miners invested in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. If a miner has 90%, which I have not seen evidence of, then doing a 51% attack against Bitcoin Cash would likely be fatal to it. 

I am not worried about that because anyone who invested that much into mining hardware can see how that would affect his future profits. It would cost him or her far more then they would gain. After the attack, whatever Bitcoin Cash they reversed would be almost worthless. Would they try to sell these coins again on the same exchange?

> At 90% why even bother with a blockchain. A SQL database would burn less energy.

Because a SQL database will always be permissioned. A bitcoin blockchain invites other participants. The first blocks were mined 100% by satoshi, perhaps you should ask him the same question. The answer is obvious, just because it is 100% now doesn't mean it will be 100% in the future."
"I totally understand the risks of 90% of the chain controlled by one miner. I never said 51% attacks weren't bad. Where did you get those assumptions?

I said I am not worried about having 90% of the network controlled by a single person today. I am not worried about them censoring transactions because we are still waiting for the wallet software to allow us to start using it. 

What I am saying is this is a short term thing. If Bitcoin cash is able to supplant Bitcoin, then that 90% will turn into a much smaller number. No one will care after that what the hash power was, or who controlled it.

I am not worried about that miner acting badly because I assume he is acting in his best interests. 51% attack and censoring transactions will cost him money. He has already sunk money into Bitcoin Cash and I doubt he would want to jeopardize that investment for a small short term gain.

And for the record, I have not seen any evidence presented that any single miner controls 90% of Bitcoin Cash's hashpower. You keep repeating that, but until you provide evidence, I see no reason to believe it."
"No, it doesn't.

It isn't centralizing, because *you shouldn't be running a validation node in the first place if all you are doing is accepting payments.*

Without the 90% miner, no blocks will mined until a (very distant in that case) difficulty adjustment.

With the 90% miner, the difficulty won't be reduced enough to no longer need the 90% miner.

If there's any serious fall in price of BCH or more run up for BTC, BCH gets even less profitible compared to BTC, meaning even less mining participation.

I fall to see a scenario that isn't a death spiral."
"It's clear you're not a rational debate partner.

It isn't magical thinking when used appropriately. It would be a mistake to think that advancements in storage, computation, and networking are on the verge of ending altogether in the next five years.

How do you figure? That's claiming a 70x capacity. As far as I know, the change is from 1MB to 8MB. So I would expect a far smaller difference. Further, when Segwit is active (locked in but not active currently, or has it activated?), it can average effectively about 1.7MB. So the difference would be even smaller then."

It's pretty sad really."
">the owner of a full node is not getting any

That owner is running a full wallet, for the feeling of some greater security for himself. 

If he is not running and using a wallet on his node, then he can just shut that node down. His node is not providing any security for the network. 

Why should simple clients (lite wallets) connect to a volunteer node like that? Why to trust them? What are the motives the owner has to run a node like that? They can easily decide to deceive the simple clients, like we've seen with UASF.  

Simple clients should connect directly to miner's nodes, they are directly incentivized to support and secure the network."
"Holy shit this post is beautiful.

/u/CashTipper tip 1.00 USD"
"Revenue sharing models can be constructed in the real world -- contracts between miners and full node operators to kick back some money to them.

It's not entirely out of the realm of possibility that miners will start to do this at some point, especially since it's in their best interests for the network to be healthy.

A side protocol can be constructed that also uses a hashcash/pow style proof to meter full node operation/uptime/tx's relayed and to prevent fraud on the part of full node operators collecting revenue from miners.

On top of that -- if we're talking a $2.1B a year business just in tx fees (not in mining subsidy), you can bet plenty of people/businesses will want to participate for free.

In addition one can extend the bitcoin protocol (without breaking consensus or creating the need for a hard fork) to include mechanisms for negotiating/sending fees to full node operators for relaying tx's.

A whole revenue model can be constructed for this. It will be a new class of business -- a full node operator.  Your only costs are hardware and minimal electricity and some decent sysadmin skills.

Hell eventually someone will write a killer fullnode client that will be ""fire and forget"" and just run itself.

All of this is not hard to imagine if we're talking about a $2.1B a year market.

And it's more efficient than getting bankers involved with their LN.

Ahhh. Well, that's rather setting it up conveniently. But yeah, that makes sense then.
who financed test transactions? or no (low) fee was needed?
"Don't  be so salty that Bitcoin Cash is working beautifully as expected :)

>Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required. Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee. The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is. I don't think the threshold should ever be 0. **We should always allow at least some free transactions.**

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=994.msg12168#msg12168

But if you want to pay an artificially high transaction fee from an artificially crippled network please be my guess, Blockstream's settlement system is for you!"
"There was no problem with the larger blocks, and the system handled it fine, the only problem is people simply weren't psychologically ready and miners were still not discerning enough about free transactions. But the only way to ever have congestion issues fixed, is to actually increase transaction throughput.

Once people got used to the increased throughput, people stopped worrying, it'll be the same with every block increase IMO."
It was a comment he made on reddit, and is probably lost in his sea of noise that he makes here unfortunately, but im pretty sure it was about a month or two ago.
Why not?
Because in theory, once a block is full space is more or less auctioned off to the highest bidder.  If the spammer's goal is to slow down my transaction, he has to outbid me on every single byte of the next block.  If he wants me to pay $2.50 for my 1/2 kb, he has to pay the same rate for all the block space that he uses.
"When the block size limit has not been reached transaction fees are basically tips. Once blocks are full miners will begin prioritizing transactions that net them the most profit and leaving ones that don't behind in the mempool. Effectively this turns the transaction fee system into a live auction for limited block space. The goal of a spam attack is to drive up the minimum clearing price of this auction.

If the spammer just pays really low fees then it's really easy to outbid them. If the spam is all 2000 Satoshi Cash per kB, then you just need to ensure your transaction's fee value is higher than that. It doesn't matter how big or small those transactions are either - one transaction of 10kB has to pay 10 times the fees of a 1kB transaction in order to maintain the same Satoshi Cash per kB value.

If your goal is to make Bitcoin (or BeeCash) unusable, what you are trying to do is outbid the rest of the network for that block space. Since Bitcoin Cash Override allows miners to create blocks 8x larger than Bitcore Coin, they have to spend 8x as much money to do the same job."
Miners choose the acceptable fees.
"Cool; thanks."
"It's the free capacity on top of the ""good"" transactions that the attacker has to fill up. If normal one is 900kB, you need to add only 100 KB to fill up a block on the legacy chain but 7.1 MB on the big blocks chain. That's ~~80x~~ 71x more expensive."
"Assuming a block contains 900KB of ""real"" transactions, then the spammer only has to generate 100KB of txns to fill the 1MB block, or 7.1MB of txns to fill the 8MB block."
"I believe it was Gavin who said ""there is no unimportant transaction""."
"If blocks start all being 8MB right now, and I do not enable pruning. But blocks are not there yet, and won't be in those two years.

And I really have no intention to keep the whole blockchain on my PC. A past week of blocks is more than I need for my security. But while I have the space, I will continue storing."

Lol, 8MB block for 1.8m USD transaction
"You may want to recall how internet service providers make money. A customer may have 5,10,25,50,100mbps downstream, but not all users can simultaneously utilize that bandwidth 24/7. 1000s of people are sharing 100mbps and usually not all using at the same time. If 10% saturate, it will come to a crawl. The land line phone systems were build with capacity for 1-2% of the population. Same with Cell phones. This is why during 9/11 it was impossible to make a phone call in t+8hrs. It also happens very frequently on New Years.

The only way for bigger and bigger blocks to work is centralization. Nodes will drop off when they can't utilize Netflix, YouTube and Xbox Live alongside maintaining a full node. This will drop network traffic overall. If everyone is ok with trusting a couple major block explorers, that's your prerogative. If your BTC goes missing, did someone compromise your private key or did they just update an entry on one of the few centralized block explorers? What happens if a government outlaws crypto and seizes the few centralized block explorers in operation?

Maybe not a problem now, but look 20-50 years down the road."

Perhaps you should just plainly say what it is you are not saying via a movie reference.
Can someone explain why a large block is such a problem when it comes to mining. As far as the math goes, you are still mining for a specific solution to the problem and since its a brute force effort, the probability remains the same. Its not as if more data in the blocks means the required hash is any more difficult. 
">  large businesses and even some individuals will demand the ability to run a node.

C'mon man.  No large business is going to be priced out of running a validation node.

Does 1GB every ten minutes really sound like a lot of data for a business?  Then I'm sorry, you don't really work in information tech, because this is simply not a scary amount of data.  FFS I can download - and upload - 1GB every 15 seconds, from my *house*.

Plus we're talking about a scale that will take many, many years to reach.  By the time we're mining 1GB blocks, 1GB blocks will simply seem normal.

If there are 50K independent economic validators then no end user need ever independently validate the blockchain.  It will be effectively incorruptible.

Edit: also

> make any kind of ""mathematical"" proof of ideal block size.

who the hell tried to make a mathematical proof of ideal block size? 

the poster merely performed a cocktail-napkin reasonability test.  he showed that using reasonable, even conservative numbers, even scaling to 1GB blocks does not seem to necessarily lead to something terrible happening - in fact, it could be quite the opposite.

nobody claimed to be mathematically proving an ""ideal block size"" and it's strange that this is what you thought he was doing."
"Ye well its a very expensive attack, since if they would do that then the price of the coin would be worthless and they would POW change making the mining equipment worthless. 

If you are so worried about that then just know that the lightning network would be much worse, since instead of you justtemporarily freezing your funds, they can literally steal them.

Lastly mining is not yet profitable, once the difficulty adjusts in 100 hours many other miners will join. The current miners are doing so because they believe in the project."
"If it's not Jihan, who is it?

Let's be logical here:

Everyone mining BCH is making a loss in opportunity cost against BTC.

Who is the only person with a fuck load of mining equipment and that level of motivation to see BCH succeed as to subsidise it like this at such a cost.

Jihan is the only rational answer to ""who is the mystery miner"".

The mystery miner is the only person who would be able to fill the blocks without incurring prohibitive cost.

Whyever he's doing it, he has a reason. It may just be a throughput stress test. It may be because he has mathematical hacks.

Me and you can speculate all day, neither one of us knows.

But I can't see a credible answer to ""who is the miner"" and ""who is filling the blocks"" that isn't ""Jihan""."
"I don't claim certainty, but I literally can't think of another actor.

Jihan needs to be there as 90% miner to get to the difficulty decrease in a reasonable time.

Why he'd fill the blocks, dunno, stress test? ASICBOOST, it's all speculation.

I can't see it being an attack on BCH because people are just going to go ""look it functions with 8mb blocks""."
If it's just a one-off, and the transaction fee is 3c/tx, that's $1200 per block. That's fairly high, but not high enough to pinpoint Jihan (or any other individual) with 90% certainty.

The poster assumed there would be ~50K economically relevant nodes at ""full-Visa-plus"" adoption.  I think that 50K businesses at full global Bitcoin adoption is a perfectly reasonable, if not conservative number.

> less likely to run full nodes and therefore less likely to use the currency at all

Assuming that it is the ability to independently validate the blockchain that is the main reason people will adopt Bitcoin is just plain stupid.
