I‘ll still sit on the toilet the same way
This is fantastic. Bookmarked!
awesome, would be great to have you!
we are integrated into Toshi (toshi.org), which lets you check out seamlessly through the app already
give Toshi (toshi.org) a try, we're listed there under marketplaces
we're not currently planning an ICO, but we can't rule it out for the future if we feel like it could really add value
exactly, small fee in the beginning and as users become trusted nodes they can book through a smart contract directly 
With respect to identity: if hosts asks for it, we can verify IDs. Also, we don't offer any insurance (Airbnd didn't for the first 25m booking). We have a partnership with slice.is, through which our US and Canadian hosts can get a $2m insurance on a night-by-night basis (costs 5-10$ per night in my experience). 
"i'd love to offer you something in Pasadena, i'd have to check whether we have any listings there yet
"
thanks for the support!
"Hi, so here are my quick answers:
1) We currently act as intermediary, but we don't censor messages like Airbnb does. So people are free to book outside of the platform if they chose to do so. Our long-term vision is to allow for pure P2P exchange through a smart contract, which connects peer reviews with payment (more updates on that to follow). Since Airbnb is taking up to 20% in fees, they have a monetization model, that's totally different from our vision, thus we don't see crypto payments as the main differentiating factor really
2) We don't offer any insurance (Airbnd didn't for the first 25m booking). We have a partnership with slice.is, through which our US and Canadian hosts can get a $2m insurance on a night-by-night basis (costs 5-10$ per night in my experience).
3 We do keep it from booking till payout, so the hosts are exposed to some crypto fluctuations for that period. It hasn't been a problem so far, but it's something we'll have to solve (potentially with stablecoins)"
i could certainly do this, e.g. one idea i had was to just use a global map for all listings and an open map framework
thanks!
no ICO planned
we're working towards becoming a full dapp, we want to store the reviews on chain (i.e. save it to IPFS and save the hash onchain), we've run into some problem building out the first version but have made a lot of progress lately. working on making it a full dapp through a social protocol is absolute priority to us
the problem has to do with hosts listing in crypto as base currency and then the price might have gone... i would suggest to just message the host and most times they are willing to adjust it to the price of Airbnb or below
yes, i know what you mean. 80% of the properties on Airbnb are professional owners nowadays, which means that much of the original concept is really lost. however, we don't feel like we should keep people from listing multiple properties, rather we try to give people who offer their own homes an extra boost
if you're a host, you can request that we do ID verification for a guest who is sending a booking request
yes, it's growing steadily but consistently...i feel it's something that takes time to get to a state where people really feel like it's useful for them
"thanks!

"
glad you like it, most sites are totally cluttered ... that being said, definitely still needs lots of work
would love to have you. our next step of development is the creation of a robust and meaningful smart contract that allows guests and hosts to transact autonomously without us as the intermediary, but lightning payments have been suggested before and we'll need to look into that at some point for sure
sounds like you're very optimistic when it comes to mass adoption of crypto
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ether
You seem to assume that everyone with crypto is wealthy... 
awesome, glad you like it
thanks, much appreciated!
cool, welcome!
You can. Go to the bottom of the page and switch to BCH.
just saw this now, the currency switch on the bottom, but i think you found it already
we've been active since fall of last year and have had a hundreds of trips booked already, you can pay with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ether
"if you check it out on desktop, it's really simple and self-explanatory like on Airbnb: just create an account and in the dashboard go to ""add listing"""
haha, yeah, it's less pretentious then other names i guess
i do support BCH, you can see it when you use the currency switch on the bottom left or bottom on mobile
true, we are available through the Toshi app(https://www.toshi.org), but that only works for Ether
we get about a booking a day by now
thanks! would love to have you as a guest sometime
we have boats and tents listed, so i dont' see why we shouldn't have a bunker  :)
"yes, there's a currency switch on the bottom left and/or bottom (on mobile) where you can compare it to fiat

you typically prepay us (unless you want to pay the host directly) and we then make the payout 24h after checkin. we have the same cancellation policies as Airbnb"
Ok that makes sense, thanks for the information :-)
"u/WintheGym, you've received `0.001 BCH ($0.985857 USD)`!

yes, i kept working at it over the past months, happy that it's still alive and kicking
thanks for your support!

Awesome!!!
we're subject to the same laws as Airbnb if that's what you're asking
Redditor /u/s1lverbox has low karma in this subreddit.
hmm, strange, it's loads super fast on my testing machines...maybe try the desktop, which is a better experience anyways
yep, we have an iCal sync feature
Bookmarked too :D
Question - how does it work being a host? Are proceeds from the various payments done with various cryptos converted to fiat to the host or can the host specify what type of crypto he/she wants the proceeds to be converted to? 
Awesome. Thanks! 
awesome, welcome!
Agree.  If there’s room up top. /u/winthegym
we don't, but if you want to upload your listings you can just send us a link to your Airbnb account
"thanks and yes, agreed, or have fiat USD shown next to the crypto price for convenience as a default

we put it there because it's where Airbnb put it and we thought people would be used to it, but turns out people hardly ever switch currencies on Airbnb"
yes, so the way it works it that you will need to have to get a night-by-night insurance from them, it costs about $5-10 per night from my experience. since we have only a fraction of the Airbnb fees (or no fees if you book directly with the guest) this still makes sense for the most part of hosts. also, it's an actual insurance, unlike the $1m discretionary escrow of Airbnb
yes, it was, definitely in the beginning. we offer to upload listings for them if they already list on Airbnb, that's how we got to this initial size
obviously not! but i don't get your point
90% of our hosts are also on other platforms, we then verify reviews for them
"So does that mean that it is the host that decides what they want to receive? 
I mean does it mean that e.g. lets say I find a nice crib in LA that I want to rent it, and I only have e.g. LTC and the guy renting it out only takes, say, ZEC? If/how is that handled?
"
Just found a bug on the website. The page where you name the rooms the guests have access to wont let me click next
"my point is:

I live in Thailand, and in October, I go for 2 weeks to Pattaya.

When I book with Airbnb, I pay for a apartment,  23 Euro per night.

When I book with you, I pay for the the apartment, in crypto, after exchange, 64 Euro per night.

yay, me so happy to pay double, almost triple,  of the  price

"
at the moment we only accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, LTC and ETH. If you want to use other currencies, we have often had the guest and host communicate and arrange that independently. we don't censor messages, so you're free to find an arrangement with the host anytime
if you dm me the email you signed up with i can fix it, it works seamlessly for most users, but some have experienced bugs 
you obviously didn't get my point that hosts who host on Airbnb quote the same price on our platform
So the host directly receives whatever currency the guest pays with?
"Sorry, I wasn't being clear enough. It was an example - was trying to be agnostic in choice of crypto :-) 

Cool, that there is this option. 

But ok, let's say I have BCH to spend and a host that wants BTC - how is that handled then? Do you e.g. Shapeshift it or do I need to do that myself? "
I logged out and back in and it works now
yep
we've experimented with a Shapeshift API integration that links to the default choice of the host, but we haven't implemented this yet. So preferably you'd come to an agreement with the host at this point before booking. we could do the currency conversion manually, but that's obviously not scalable so we try not to do it at this point
cool, glad to hear
cool
i know of the etherisc project, could def be an option
"ah, ok, yep, funds are held in escrow until 24h after check in and here's the cancellation policy (which mirrors that of Airbnb)
https://www.cryptocribs.com/cancellation-policies"
hopefully if crypto goes even closer to the moon you can get a house soonish 
at the moment we don't usually convert, but we could do it in the future, and it's best if you list in fiat (it then updates crypto prices on an hourly basis)
That's really great, I hope you can go further, I would definetly participate if I had a house to rent
I think they meant regarding host-guest disputes. Is money held in escrow? Is there a way to get a partial/full refund? Etc...
">We don't offer any insurance (Airbnd didn't for the first 25m booking). We have a partnership with slice.is, through which our US and Canadian hosts can get a $2m insurance on a night-by-night basis (costs 5-10$ per night in my experience). 

I hope to test your services soon, for tax reason I cannot spend my BCH until they are more than a year old.

So I still have to wait few months,

I hope you get insurance in all country, I think it is important.

Great job BTW.

(I like the website look a lot!)"
Maybe there is an option in the future with etherisc.com 
Just signed up to host!
"Saw your LinkedIn and I thought it's the US. Cool! 
Edit: was wondering if you guys have entered Ldn market. I'd be interested in helping you guys to grow!"
Awesome!! The option wasn't clear to me even though I had checked the entire page. Cheers
Might be better to move that control to the top of the page or by the Where, when, guests search bar 
I'd suggest moving the switch next to the price, or somewhere for better visibility. Great site though will certainly be making use of it!
Have you considered adding Request network support? Wooreq is awesome!
we're currently based out of Zurich Switzerland
OK cool, I did wonder if desktop was different. I'll pass it on and hopefully they list. Gl with it all. 
Do you have an API?
"Fantastic, thank you for all of these answers! :) I’m super excited about your site! :)

I totally didn't see that currency switch in the lower left, even though I had spent about 25 minutes browsing through the site on an iPad... might be nice to have that currency switch at the top for more visibility."
That is a great option as my current hosting would be in California. I am impressed with the site although I think the text used is a little tacky lol. I definitely plan to host if this insurance can be made compulsory for any guest bookings.. I assume the cost is taken on by the guest? Appreciate the prompt response btw. Thanks!
Yep, thanks for the answer mate
Wait! What?! The platform uses smart contracts to execute the rental transaction? That’s so cool if true. 
That is reasonable. How do you get people to register their properties at your system? This seems to be the most difficult part.

What is your monetization model?"
"no, no, no, no,
I pay in FIAT, 
I don't pay double price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gosh how you can even think that a normal person pays the double price because he believe in crypto
"
I mean how do you vet the hosts, I misused the word renter
thanks!
"Ah great ! I did not see it (you should probably move / copy the choice list on the top of the screen for ease of use). 

A tweet is in order then :)

https://twitter.com/_h16/status/1002548493775441920

(It's in French, hope you don't mind)"
yep, agreed, we need some more work on the frontend
yes, there's a currency switch on the bottom left and/or bottom (on mobile) where you can compare it to fiat

"Nice site!! Great listings! 

Are you planning on supporting BCH? I see a listing that I’m interested in, but it only lists the price in BTC instead of BCH. I only have BCH to spend.

Would also be nice to see the comparable fiat price as well.

Oh, and what happens if we prepay a host through your site, and then we show up to the place and it was a scam or something bad like that? Like, we show up and there’s no apartment to stay in at all? How do you handle problems like that, since we’ve already prepaid?"
Shouldn't you include the comparable rate in fiat? I don't believe anyone can really make an informed decision about the cost of these places when priced in BTC.
"Wow! Really impressive! Bookmarked.

Will definitely try to use it for future travels. 

1000 bits u/tippr"
"Nice. I seen this when you just made it I am glad its working out great. 

Will definitly try to use this on my next getaway if possible. Cheers "
This is great since I have hosted on air bnb before. What are the solutions around insurance from guests damaging or causing harm? Air bnb provides $1m coverages. Just wondering as a host I am concerned about safety and damages of my property. 
Hey, congratulations, your service has grown a lot since I last checked it out. Definitely going to use it this summer.
Awesome! Keep up the good work 👍
Does it work well with the law? 
Props dude! Great idea. Airbnb is already a P2P business anyway.
I’m trying to launch a dapp without us by an ICO. Can I Pm you with questions???
Great work. On mobile seems to load slow. Maybe it's my android though.
looks really nice! 
Does it have features to allow hosts to coordinate bookings between Airbnb and Cryptocribs so you don't have conflicts? 
What a fantastic idea! Love it!! 
What currencies are you taking?
This is really great, can't wait to use it and possibly start hosting!  Would be nice if you had an option to list prices in whatever currency people prefer.  I'd like to pay using crypto, however it's hard to know what's a decent deal when things are listed in it. 
Do you have any plans for mobile apps?
This is great! I just wish there was an app for it.
This is awesome. Because I’m one of those people who search for everything with a plus crypto pay option. Like. Airtickets in crypto. Stay will make it better. More power to you. Hope you guys succeed. Are you planning for an ico soon?
Very cool! How do you pay the bills? Small fee?
This is really nice. I like the simple layout. How do you manage identity/safety issues?
"Bookmarked for reference. I have considered going to Pasadena, CA in September; have you considered adding some properties in that city?"
Very cool, thank you u/winthegym
Pretty cool. Can I list my bunker? 
Thank you for doing this! And for telling like it is.
Awesome! Great work, thank you!
Great now make an android and iPhone app for it. 
"This is really cool and good on you for taking on a straight down the line, non-scammy business model. We all really appreciate your efforts.

Cool product too ^^"
Wow....this is really sweet!
Great effort, this is what we need more of!
Very nice! Like the simple and clean design. 
May I suggest that you add the prices in $ amount as well? Just next to the btc price so I dont have to use externel services to calculate the price :)
"This is really f*cking cool.

Where are you based? I didn't see a location on your careers page."
I got my first couple of enquiries recently!
Looks like their is a lot more offers than the last time i checked. Well done keep it going, we need project like this one 
I am curious to know how conflict are managed, is there some kind of insurance?
This is really cool.  Congratulations
Site looks nice and seems to work well. The font (Lekton) is painful to read. I'd suggest not using a fixed with font :)
Wow this is really nice! I'm gonna use it. Are you guys based in US?
Sweet \- I've kept my place off of airbnb because the town is sending out fines, instead opted to put my place on openbazaar and got little/no traction, I'll list and see what happens...I always prefer crypto over fiat.
Wow ! Gangsta !! Great work !
"Love the layout, clear and concise.

Can't see any BCH support though - I'd be using this over airbnb if I could spend my Bitcoin Cash there..."
[removed]
wow amazing!
 Nice, question though. How does one go about putting their accommodation on here. I have family who should be interested who own/run a bnb. Loaded your page on my phone and couldn't see a link, definitely worth it being easy to add properties on there. 
Love that name!!!!
"Great. A quick suggestion.

Add an available city/state button. This would be so we can see where has listings. If I'm taking a trip and driving I can look to see where I can rent to plan my stops."
Can you please add a map based search function, maybe overlay the addresses on open street maps. That's my main gripe, because I look along routes I'm taking for a pad (Europe)
good stuff. nice to see ppl working on projects before the ICO!
As soon as you support BCH, I'll make sure to tweet your URL around (with a few 1000s followers, that might help ?).
"Awesome, how much bookings & traffic do you get a day on average? Might use this soon :) 
"
thanks! do give it a try sometime, we need people trying new stuff...that's why i force myself to subscribe to one new producthunt item every week
Kyber will probably be better for what you want. Shapesift fees can get huge quickly. 
How do you vet renters?
This is awesome!! Is it actually a dapp? (Still dope either way 😎)
Nice work! Do you hold deposits? If so,  look to leverage DGX in the future due to it’s stability. I’m sure the Digix team would be supportive.  
Looks great. So, when's the ICO?
Fair play. 
EOS can learn a thing or two from you. 
I've seen this a few times, how is the project going?
Consider advertising on my site. Check bio for info. 
Great site, this is what it's all about! Building and deploying products that are ready to facilitate real-life use cases. Kudos to you. And a nice touch with the HONY inspired feed giving it a personal touch. 
I really like how clean the layout of the webpage is.  Not a lot of clutter or overwhelming graphics to distract from the product. Good job. 
Thats a nice work you've done there! GJ!
Looks good. But could you make searching for a location independent from google maps? Not everybody likes to be tracked by google.
"I have 1 problem,

your prices are the double from FIAT.

For Pattaya, Thailand, for the same condo, same period.

Price on your website is, for 1 night  : 0.0093 BTC, for Coinbase, take 6.400, makes 64 euro per night.

When  I book with my Airbnb account, and pay in Euro, I pay 23 euro per night.

When I pay with BCH, it's 64 Euro, when I pay in Euro, it,s 23 Euro, But I believe you will find people who 50% more because they are BCH community
]
"
"Nice project, I have couple questions:

1) What happens with your project if AirBnB include Crypto payments?

2) Do you offer some guest/host protection in case of damage/problems?

3) Do you keep all crypto from time of booking until time of stay? What if there is big oscillation of price and one party simply decide that it longer makes no sense move forward with booking (e.g. you pay for stay BCH 100$ and as booking time arrives that same crypto is worth 250$. It makes more sense for you to cancel booking and find another one for 100$. Same goes for host if price drops)

Thanks."
thank you for the support!
yep, we've made great progress on a shoe-string budget
we're currently based out of Zurich, but hoping to travel and live out of CryptoCribs at one point in the future
Agreed.  Most brains aren't yet trained to think in crypto. Make it easier for first-timers. 
there's a conversion button on the bottom left actually, but i need to change this so it shows right next to the listings i guess. i've had this question asked over and over again
thanks, would be cool to have you as a guest or host sometime
thanks, doing my best to keep it alive!
cool, glad you like it!
cool!
[deleted]
Sounds like a great honey pot for crypto currency related kidnapping torture and extortion.  Good luck with that.
"This is is great, can’t wait to give it a try next time I travel! Love that you didn’t create a shitty token. 
Are you integrating lightning payments too?"
