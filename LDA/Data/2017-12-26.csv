"Dang!  Thanks a ton for the tips Santa!

Gonna have to get tippr figured out sooner than I expected now."
Lol. Dude you have no idea what you are talking about. Why would anyone care about creating volume off chain? That isn’t even real volume... Also I transfer my tips to my own wallet. Why wouldn’t I? Haha. Why would I just send them around to other people to create volume. Why should I give a fuck about volume? I just like being tipped in something I can actually use.
"I have received a lot of tips of bitcoin cash but I never even really seen bitcoin tips happen for anyone, and it’s obvious why...

...because Bitcoin doesn't need to create fake volume. Also, your noob is showing.


the difference is that you could never transfer your tips to your own wallet because of the fees. I mean even if I collected $10 in tips I wouldn’t actually get to spend any of that bitcoin....

No one it transferring it to their own wallets, they're just tipping it backwards and forwards to create fake volume.

Kinda funny how the offchain tipper is essentially tabs, and functions kinda like LN.


Notice how my comments have not been voted down, despite them being anti bcash in the bcash forum... That's because what I'm saying is factually correct.

"
"You're genuinely way too kind! 

Thank you again :)"
"Thanks man you're awesome.. Also these are my first BCH :) 

Friendship ended with BitCoin now BitCoin Cash is my new friend :D

Thanks a ton !!"

Wouldn't it be wonderful if BCH value improved enough so that all tippees this year can be tippers next?

It's now my new years resolution to help make it so.

Tears in my eyes, this is so beautiful. "

Wow lol! Thanks dude I appreciate it. :D
"You, and everyone, are very welcome.  This was an incredible experience from my end of things, too.  Great people!  The surprise from the other random subreddits where I tipped was really fun.  The many notes and thanks and stories people posted an PM'd were really inspiration to keep at it.  

In 24 hours, I did not receive any negative messages at all.  That really impressed me about our communities on this holiday.  People sent me large tips to keep it going, which was very unexpected: that that they were giving indirectly through Santa."

"I put in a really small amount of BCH ages in to tippr ages ago and tipped only a couple of people but I'm sure my balance in terms of fiat is higher than before!

I'll probably transfer some more to tip and stuff."

"You're not telling me how I'm wrong though - you're just saying I'm wrong. 

If you want to have an intelligent discussion about store of values, value and economy, I'd be happy to oblige. If you want to continue in blissful ignorance, more power to you. "
"You're clearly making up your own argument now - that's a sign of defeat or senility. Pick which one you'd prefer.

- No-one said gold doesn't have utility - merely that the vast billions invested in gold isn't for the practical usage of the metal, but rather as a store of value.

- No-one said anything about art's transactionability, just that it can act as a store of value (but it can be exchanged - if someone gave me an original Da Vinci in exchange for my house, I'd exchange without batting an eyelid). 

- Funny how you tell me to learn economics when you don't understand the basics of how value is prescribed, or what makes something a store of value.

>Things once perceived as a store of value with no utility fail.

That's what you stated. I showed how you were wrong by example of art (which can little to no practical utility) and gold (which is invested in as a store of value, than for its industrial usage).


Look, I understand you don't want to admit you're wrong. To be honest, I don't really care if you do or don't. What's important is that you keep learning, and not let your brain be swept away by superficial emotions and ignorance. Keep learning. "
You're not here to have an intelligent conversation, you are hear to spout bullshit.  Clear bullshit.  There is no point in conversing with someone who thinks Gold doesn't have utility and Art is a store value that can also be exchanged.  Go learn economics.  Supply and demand.  Liquidity.  Something.  Anything.
you do realize that the next btc update increases the block size and also provides a more long term solution with Segwit2x, right?
True.. unfortunately it could mean that when BCH finally equals/exceeds BTC they could both be at a much much lower price/USD.
"Those are empty blocks. A quick copy pasta from my other post using Visa average TX and max TX rates. Ignore the other stuff I wrote for someone else, but this is some quick math on how the blockchain would grow with on chain scaling.

""To do full on chain scaling, and to match visas average of 2000tx/s (max 50k tx/s)

The blockchain would grow 34.56MB per minute. 2.073 Gigabytes per hour. 49.752 Gigabytes per day. 348.264 Gigabytes per week. 1.567 Terabytes per month 18.159 Terabytes a year.

And that is just to match Visa at it's lowest, in one year. If you want to match what Visa can max out at, the blockchain would require 453.975 Terabyes a year.

But you said the drive would be good for 15 years in housing the blockchain. So at the minimum level the drive would have to be 272 Terabytes, and 6.81 Petabytes if transactions were closer to Visa's now current peak rate. """
"You may be correct, but are out of context regardless. The reasons you mentioned have nothing to do with blocksize increases killing the chain, and instead went a little outside the scope of our discussion. This same problem will occur to any chain with a deflationary (logarithmicly inflationary) supply.

Further, your claim, however likely, is still not guaranteed to happen. "
For $150 you can get a hard drive which will last for the next 15 years...

Bitcoin has always been feasible.. creating an artificial limit is creating a problem.. this problem only exists because of the cap. It must be raised. Bitcoin will fail because the developers refuse to see it. Even if raised conservatively , they will continue to keep a high fee market in order to make their side chains relevant.. why would anyone use a side chain when onchain is cheaper.. I give you blockstream and their end goals.. 
"But bch and classic bitcoin implemention has already solved the problem, it requires a very minimal amount of work to increase blocksize and get consensus. Bitcoin core has kept the platform artificially limited by not increasing block sizes for arbitrary reasons and then shoehorns their own proprietary solution into it, which still doesn't solve the problem. Then claims that it's a store of value rather than currency. 

Tcp/ip has lasted for decades why can't the initial bitcoin implemention?

"
"$150 gets you a hard drive which covers full 8MB blocks, the current size of Bitcoin Cash.

Cheap, huh? Because storage follows Moore's law.

Now what happens if/when Bitcoin scales to become the global cash payment system, on chain?

Well that means 7 billion people making ~50 transaction a day.

That's the entire global population participating in Bitcoin Cash.

That will incentivize ten of thousands of entities to run nodes so they can capitalize on that economic activity. Who cares if you can't run a node on your Raspberry Pi? That was **never** the intent should Bitcoin (Cash) become this wildly successful.

So let's compare the two scenarios.

Bitcoin (Cash) scales to allow everyone on Earth to make transactions. Yet ""only"" >100,000 nodes will exist.

Bitcoin doesn't scale, practically no one is able to make a transaction, but hey, you can spend your electricity to verify rich people's transactions. Woo hoo.

And don't even claim Lightening is any sort of non-centralizing solution, when its already been amply shown that it will result in giant bank hubs."
"Might have been a gross simplification. But this is a great quote from the white paper that I've read many times. 

""A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
memory."""
So many problems with that statement. Oh well, it's for laymen.
In the white paper nodes are equated with miners, as all nodes would be mining. That said I do believe non mining nodes which are transacting play a big part in securing the network. 
"I’ve been wanting to consolodate all my bitcoins into one wallet for about a week, today is the lowest I’ve seen the fees (£17 to move £200), but a few days ago it was £70 to move £200.

I’m hoping it will come down a bit more"
It takes a big person to concede your mistakes. Now that you're on this side of understanding how dire the fee situation is, [allow me to try and explain to you why I think you should really think about getting rid of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m1b9g/my_mum_gave_me_100_worth_of_bitcoin_for_christmas/drqtpu5/?context=3) before tomorrow, when the fees start rising again.
"I follow your vision ,but it's a psychology game .I got almost 1 btc and  i got 1.1 bch so for me either may win the race. But wouldn't want to be the fool who sold the wrong one. So wont be buying any more btc my 0.89 wil be my highest btc hold ever, but i had 1 at some point 😢 ,but as im buying small amounts of altcoins like Lisk every month i wil be buying some bch every month to .
Today made me a firm believer in my altcoins and bitcoincash .Must say the best experience in speed and cost was Digibyte and Pivx for me it was Faster and cheaper then anything ever seen before "
Well this suggests the earliest BCH adopters have some serious cajones!
Moore's Law is not a bandaid, and everyone in the entire history of computers who has bet against Moore's Law making old 'scaling problems' irrelevant, has lost that bet. Everyone.
"Bitcoin was designed to be peer to peer electronic cash, so by the original definition BTC is not Bitcoin.

Even if you grant that the definition has changed, when Bitcoin hard-forks, the chain with the most work done would be considered Bitcoin by consensus.

*This is the only thing keeping BTC alive right now*; the fact that it's considered the ""main chain"", and most of that is based on inertia, and ignorance of it's lack of utility in its present state.

As more people become aware of the flaws of BTC it's value will plummet, and the market will crash. Out of the ashes though, Bitcoin will be reborn (IMO in the form of BCH, but other hard-forks may be in the mix by then).

I'd mention that any hard-forks of note are likely to come from the BCH chain moving forward, as contrary to popular opinion (on /r/Bitcoin at least), there are a significant number of competing Dev teams working on that chain and the BCH community are not adverse to hard-forks when they're necessary."
">larger block size is a temporary solution at best

No, it's not.

Actually, there isn't even a need for a ""solution"", because there is no problem: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ge27h/there_never_was_a_scaling_problem_the_only"
I don’t understand. I thought BTC was bitcoin.
You are tipping a known troll.
"I didn't say it was a solution for the rest of time. It works today and it will work tomorrow. If the future is shaping up (at some unknown, potential and hypothetical point in time) to look like bigger blocks will no longer cut it, a different solution can be developed as that (hypothetical and potential) date nears. 

Ultimately we can't make a claim either way about it's long term viability, only discuss our opinions on the likelihood of it, as it's largely dependent on the performance of hardware. If hardware progress slows, bigger blocks are less than ideal, but if hardware continues improving (as people often cite Moore's Law), we may never have to address this potential problem.

It's a working solution for the foreseeable future. It may not always work, but there's a possibility it could (while remaining reasonably decentralized)."
The segwit form of BTC core money gets a preferential 75% fee discount. 
Probably not, but I think BTC might.
Can't really ask anything more than that. Cheers!
And there will always be a high fee market by design. That is what the developers want.. there will never be cheap on chain transactions. That defeats the whole purpose of their side chains. The next BTC fork will not find unilateral agreement. You now need to get all the miners on board when they have been treated like shit by the core developers.. I suspect a POW change from core developers before a block increase. That’s how desperate they are for power. BTC has a shaky future..
Pffft. Most SMEs are recording that much security video today.
"Neat.

Big numbers don't scare me when it comes to storage. Moore's law is still a thing. Like I said, not everyone is expected to run a node."
I'm not disputing the fact that the current fee structure is exorbitant.  But while it CAN be as bad as the OP claims, one can find alternatives if they so choose.

i.e. not.
larger block size is a temporary solution at best, a  bandaid on a wound that needs stitches.  I say this as a guy who has everything in BCH right now.  The most promising thing that BCH has going for it over BTC is it's willingness to take actual action to solve problems and improve.

"To do full on chain scaling, and to match visas average of 2000tx/s (max 50k tx/s) 

The blockchain would grow 34.56MB per minute.
2.073 Gigabytes per hour.
49.752 Gigabytes per day.
348.264 Gigabytes per week.
1.567 Terabytes per month
18.159 Terabytes a year.

And that is just to match Visa at it's lowest, in one year. If you want to match what Visa can max out at, the blockchain would require 453.975 Terabyes a year.

But you said the drive would be good for 15 years in housing the blockchain. So at the minimum level the drive would have to be 272 Terabytes, and 6.81 Petabytes if transactions were closer to Visa's now current peak rate. 

Oh, and that is just to match Visa. Not Mastercard. Not Amex. Not Western Union. Bank wires. Paypal. Or cash transactions.

Big block on chain scaling would centralize it. As the blockchain would be massive. It would no longer be decentralized and peer to peer. The entire reason the blockchain was created was to be decentralized and peer to peer.

BCH doesn't want to be bitcoin. BCH wants to be Visa. Which is fine, but wasn't why BTC was created."
"Btc is only btc in name. In actuality it is a hardfork with segwit integration without changing the name. That's why bch was created.

Btc probably will be overtaken, it won't be overnight though maybe in 3 to 4 years.


If you want to look at trends, how about looking at the trend if btc having less purchasing power over other cryptos than before.

Or gradually declining market utilization of btc and the increasing of all other cryptos. "

"Because anyone can run a node and have voting rights. Costs are currently high due to demand outpacing the current platform.

BCH, sells out the entire concept of decentralized peer to peer to have it usable today. It's scaling solution forces the end game for it to become centralized. And then at that point? Who cares about it? You have a new Visa. Not a new peer to peer decentralized currency that was created with the sole purpose of decentralization."
You had me at nodes don't secure the network. Read the whitepaper. Nodes are the **only** thing that secure the network.
"Those with larger/faster/more efficient resources will always be the biggest validators of the blockchain. Big blocks reduce centralization by allowing everyone in the world to use it (less fees) and giving many more people a reason to mine.

Also take a look at how BTC centralizes miners here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k6p13/i_cannot_afford_to_mine_bitcoin_core_i_am_forced/

You're saying BTC is peer to peer currency with $40 fees? (I paid $70 the other day and it was done in 1 hour)"
As were Bitcoin's for the majority of it's history. And that was preferable to the alternative, as is evidenced by **reality**. 
do you support segwit?
Apparently they can't handle the truth. Ignorance is bliss and all that I guess. 
/r/BTC is not 100% fud, memes, and shilling. You're thinking of that other sub.
"this is the biggest fallacy people have against BCH. Centralization. Mining centralization is not a problem. https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek

BCH currently has around 13% of the hashrate of BTC and rising. This is still a huge amount. https://fork.lol/

Nodes don't actually secure the network - they are simply relays. There is enough money at stake that large stakeholders will simply run their own nodes to help with the broadcast of the blockchain. As the usage rises, so does the value, so does the incentive to run a node. You can't double spend or do anything to change the blockchain with only a node. "
I don't attack Bitcoin, I attack the people who created a bad situation regarding the fees. They promised segwit would fix it. It hasn't fixed it. It's not even in the GUI. I can't even move my coins to segwit addresses because the fees are high to do this. They should have first done the 2x fork to give people the opportunity to move their coins.
"[$41](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html) average BTC transaction fees, [168,000](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) unconfirmed transactions... Is that a script, or facts? Is that acceptable performance, or suboptimal ""trash?"" "
"Wrong.  The point of bitcoin is to be censorship resistant.  Decentralization helps, but is not the main goal. Running nodes does not help censorship resistance in the slightest.  In fact, btc is far more centralized where it counts in the development team being controlled (github repository)  by a single company blockstream.

Users are not supposed to be running full nodes.  Read the whitepaper. Or do you still not get it yet, Greg."
"But if it isn't peer and to peer and decentralized like bitcoin is supposed to be, then you haven't created anything new. You've just created a new Visa.
"
It's not a bad idea. But getting segwit addresses is a pain with the current fees.
"The tangle scale just like a regular blockchain (linear scaling) and so far need a centralised server to avoid double spend.

To avoid IMO."
You're assuming people are day trading like Fiat markets and buying / selling based on articles. People do it. But it is not as common as you'd think in crypto because of the additional utility of crypto currencies. People buy Ether for speculation, trade and to enable Dapps. 
Lol what do you propose? Price controls on Bitcoin?
Nothing is instant. C
Doge has a solution to the scaling issue?
"Litecoin was a fork of the bitcoin code.

How?
It's value is subjective, aka what the market decides it is.  Up until very recently btc's issues weren't mainstream, what we're seeing right now is the fundamental scaling issues of BTC/blockchain hitting the mainstream (and even noob/relatively noob crypto investor) consciousness.  
"> So even if BCH is more functional as a currency, what the fuck is the point?

The point is Bitcoin Cash is more functional as a currency and as a store of value. Bitcoin Cash can scale to global levels with low fees and has already acquired the network effect advantage. You obviously don't realise that's all Bitcoin Cash needs to become the first global currency.  "
Anyone was an early bitcoin cash adipter because they got it for free at the time
I guess. But it's really true of any market. No one can set a price on anything except a buyer and seller together.
Well we're getting cucked right now by btc, feels bad man.  
">Ultimately we can't make a claim either way about it's long term viability

Lol yes you can. It's *not* viable long-term. You can't have near-zero-fee xts indefinitely on blockchain with a halvening.  Eventually a halvening will cut so many miners out that the hashrate is low enough for someone to double-spend, all faith in the system is lost, and the price drops to 0."

"**Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ether, Oh My! What’s With All the Bitcoin Clones?**

*An explainer on what exactly are ‘altcoins,’ why they exist and what makes them different*

Bitcoin’s wild ride has gotten a huge amount of attention. But over the past two weeks, some of its crypto cousins, like litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, have muscled their way into the spotlight.

On Tuesday, for instance, bitcoin-services company Coinbase announced it would list and support Bitcoin Cash, which is an alternative version of bitcoin that launched on Aug. 1. The news sent prices of bitcoin down and Bitcoin Cash skyrocketing.

Plenty of people are confused enough about bitcoin. Alternatives to bitcoin, or “altcoins,” muddy the waters further. Here are answers to some basic questions about them.

**Altcoins? What are altcoins?**

Altcoin is a nickname given to currencies that are a variation on bitcoin. The way bitcoin itself was created encourages this. When bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin in 2009, he or she did it as an open-source software project. That means that, unlike say the code for Microsoft Windows, anybody could take the program, reconfigure it and launch their own version. Litecoin was the first to do this, in 2011.

**Are there many of these altcoins?**

Yep. A research website called coinmarketcap.com recently listed 1,374 altcoins. Most are marginal at best. About 300 of them, with names like PinkDog, MagicCoin and BitSoar, have no measurable market. But there are a handful that have a legitimate shot at becoming viable online currencies.

**Which ones seem viable?**

Ethereum, also known as ether, is probably the most popular. As of Friday, it had a $60 billion market value, second only to bitcoin, and has attracted a sizable community of developers and entrepreneurs. Ripple and litecoin are also popular. And Bitcoin Cash grew far bigger this week; it rose 60% in one day, and its market value stood at about $40 billion, after Coinbase said it would list the coin.

**How do these other coins compare in size and performance to bitcoin?**

All of them are smaller than bitcoin. Some have larger circulating supplies—there are 38 billion ripple tokens, for example—and some have had larger gains this year on a percentage basis. Ethereum’s up 7,600% this year, and ripple has risen about 15,000%. Bitcoin is up about 1,200%.

**Why do people even want altcoins if they have bitcoin?**

It is a bet on the future. For all the success of bitcoin, there is no guarantee it will remain the dominant cryptocurrency. Everything in this market is highly speculative.

**Who created these other currencies?**

Some have known creators, some don’t. Charlie Lee created litecoin. Vitalik Buterin created ethereum. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, it was a group of developers and businesses who weren’t satisfied with the existing configuration of bitcoin. Prominent and early supporters included Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” and Jihan Wu, the co-founder of a big Chinese mining company called Bitmain. A developer named Amaury Sechet wrote the initial code that allowed the fork.

**Fork?**

A fork is a term for a new version of a software program. Bitcoin is really nothing more than software, a program that allows two people to make an exchange of value. Because nobody owns that software, anybody can “fork” it, can create their own version of it. Bitcoin Cash and all these other altcoins are really just versions of the bitcoin program.

**How is Bitcoin Cash Different from bitcoin?**

In most respects, it is similar to bitcoin. It works the same way, and it has the exact same transaction history as the original bitcoin, up to Aug. 1, 2017. Its primary difference is that it is designed to allow more transactions to pass through, on a per-second basis, than bitcoin, which leads to lower user fees. And, of course, because it is a different market, Bitcoin Cash’s price moves independent of bitcoin itself.

**Why do I care?**

Some people have looked at Bitcoin Cash as a virtual dividend for bitcoin holders. Some see it as an easy arbitrage play. Others see Bitcoin Cash in a pitched philosophical battle against bitcoin. Indeed, its existence is the result of a fight within the bitcoin industry that at times has been more like a religious war. It has grown only more partisan and bitter as bitcoin has become more valuable.

**Do we need another version of bitcoin?**

Well, cryptocurrency is the epitome of an open market. Anybody can come along and offer a product. Bitcoin’s backers created this opening for Bitcoin Cash by not allowing any changes in the underlying code that would have allowed more transactions to fit through the network.

They have their reasons for that. But as bitcoin has grown in popularity, the result has been a situation where transactions get stuck in a bottleneck. If you want to get your transaction processed fast, you need to attach a voluntary fee.

Those “voluntary” fees have reached an average cost of about $30 per transaction. That makes bitcoin virtually unusable for all but very large transactions. The Bitcoin Cash crowd is just trying to offer a solution to that problem.

**Are there other differences among the different altcoins?**

Ethereum is a platform for hosting apps, a decentralized operating system. Ripple is designed for interbank payments. Even more than the design itself, though, the big difference is in the communities around each asset. Bitcoin has a community that has been growing over nine years. It has experienced developers, and virtually every business in the industry recognizes it. Bitcoin Cash, among others, doesn’t have that yet. For altcoins, expanding the base of developers and supporters is almost as important as the code.

Ethereum and litecoin have their own groups of developers and supporters, working to build and expand their own networks.

**I just got into bitcoin. Do the altcoins affect me?**

The existence of these other coins doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with bitcoin, and you can buy and sell any of them independently. On the other hand, while there is a competition among these coins, at times they move in tandem, like stocks on a day when the whole market is way up.

**How important was the Coinbase move with Bitcoin Cash?**

Coinbase has emerged as the biggest bitcoin exchange, and it has become a company that is closest to the mainstream. Its app has become one of the most downloaded, and it has one of the largest user bases in the industry. So what it does carries weight.

**Does Coinbase support any other altcoins?**

Coinbase allows trading of bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, litecoin and ethereum.

**What happens now?**

The price and market value of Bitcoin Cash, ethereum, litecoin and others will probably get the most attention. But what matters much more to their future is adoption.

Will people and businesses frustrated by bitcoin’s high fees migrate to these other currencies? Will software developers start working on them, and will businesses use and build apps for them or one particular altcoin?

Meanwhile, bitcoin will always be the original, and still has the largest “network effect” around it, but in tech, being first or best doesn’t always tell you who succeeds. Anyone remember Betamax or Netscape?

**Corrections & Amplifications**
Coinbase doesn’t support trading of ethereum classic. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it does. (Dec. 24, 2017)"
 Tried to move about 0.0003 bitcoin for a small payment and it charged me 0.002 bitcoin. Using Coinbase
"It is technically easier to transitions from BTC to BCH. In the long run it's not big deal... it only becomes important if businesses like BitPay transition to BCH (which is announced and expected).

Other than that - programming team and economy behind coin are paramount. On dev front the biggest blocks we can do today are around 30 MB. That can naturally increase over time with better hardware and more bandwidth... but I would encourage people to keep open mind when it comes to 2nd layer solutions. On economy front it's what guys like /u/velopic are doing... [keep spending the coin and getting more people into ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m19ww/the_tippening_day_4_over_8000_tipped_in_the_past/). "
Nothing. BCH favours more centralization in trade for better use today. Future use would only further centralization. Which is what the original white paper was against.  If we wanted a usable centralized currency, we would all stick to fiat.
"Lightening Network isn't even a remote threat to Bitcoin Cash. Even if LN were here now:

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are actually faster than a LN transaction.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are not limited by the smallest intermediate channel size.

Bitcoin Cash transactions don't require the recipient, sender and all the intermediaries to be online.

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not require a prepaid bond.

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not require a timelocked bond transaction fee to be estimated months in advance.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are completely unaffected by network congestion.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions provides a natural surge capability. 

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not need to use a completely different system if the payment is too large.
 
Bitcoin Cash doesn't require a merchant to support two payment systems.


Bitcoin Cash 0-conf instant transactions, for everything else... there is Bitcoin Cash!
"
Likely, nothing. LN solves a very narrow set of payment cases - only recurrent ones, when it's justifiable to open a channel and to fund it. Plus they didn't solve the routing problem, as far as I know. And then there are all the fees, it's hard to compete with BCH or IOTA, or even Ethereum.
One is Bitcoin, the other is Mastercard. People are free to choose. 
Second that i paid 1000€ for 60 transaction in and 1 out 🙇
You are in /r/btc. We talk about all things bitcoin here. We just don't sugarcoat it.
If Segwit had >90% adoption BTC fees would be super low and so would the Mempool. Talk to the exchanges that refuse to adopt Segwit.
There are 100’s of other coins that offer equal or better solutions to fees than BCH and don’t have shady, dishonest, and manipulative people behind them...
So  either bch or litecoin will remain. Fuck...
Honest question, what's lightning or whatever it's called and will it cause BCH to crash?
Research for this Article by the author=0
Why is it always about bitcoin with you guys? Why can't you just be Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin be Bitcoin? Any serious feedback much appreciated
"> The Bitcoin Cash crowd is just trying to offer a solution to that problem.

Yeah, that and the ""problem"" of segwit blocking Asicboost. Has everyone forgotten about that? "
Can someone tell me what will happen to BCH when Bitcoin Lightning comes out (assuming it is successful)?
So is Ethereum, Litecoin, Iota and a host of others. What makes Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold different from them other than brand awareness?
"titles says ""What’s With All the Bitcoin Clones?"" article actually says nothing"
Is the original use case of Bitcoin to make many smaller transactions?  Or, do higher overall fees make sense?
The *really* weird thing is that, as of this article, BCH started going *down* for the first time in days (according to Bittrex).   Maybe I'm reading something wrong here, but that seems a little funny, right? 
The author does not understand (or ignores) the difference between a chain split and a software fork.
"Thats WSJ for ya
"
BCH is bitcoin. It's important to reflect on how we got here and what about BCH is working.
But there are better coins for this purpose that this one. Uh oh. 
Any articles on Bitcoin in the WSJ are useless.  Uniformed and void of informative information.  Those who do the research and invest wisely will makes millions...the rest will watch as certain paradigms fall slowly away...
Missing in all of this is a simple explanation for us elders as to what exactly it is and what does it do? What supports it's valuation? If a $10 pizza costs $76 in bitcoin, why would anyone want bitcoin? 
One of the biggest issues is average people calling all cryptos Bitcoin. Like how we call bandages Band-aids. 
Well, /bitcoin is 200%... /btc used to not be

">""The Bitcoin Cash crowd""


Excuse me. Who exactly?"
Been many years.
"Yes. I like my store of value.

What is your opinion on a completely centralized mining situation, with patented ASICBOOST machines? Is that part of sotashi's vision? One company controlling mining? *eye roll* "
That's why I love to use bch instead of btc. Bitcoin isn't affordable for all day transactions anymore, it's just sad but thank god there's Bitcoin Cash.
No one cares people just use decent alt coins for fast transfers 
Maybe 1/15th of 100-200 sat/byte fee transactions get confirmed each block, and at least that many get newly created in the same amount of time. So no, 100 say/byte is not a safe fee for timely confirmation.
We're salty. I have posted on /r/bitcoin for years, and I got banned for supporting bigger blocks. I'm still a bitcoin holder.
Normal fluctuations. Unlikley to be related. 
"Litecoin.

How do you define ""from scratch""?"
Try the tangle. IOTA is probably going to replace BTC at some point. No fee and much better scalability, but for now, the public only know about bitcoin, and BCH is getting more and more publicity as well. 
"I'm not sure you are being honest when you say temporary. 

Why do you think it's only temporary? 

If technology was never to improve ever a 16MB block limit would be sustainable. 

That's not a temporary solution until we hit the 16MB limit. All considered technology will improve by then, would you agree? "
B.O.A.T.S
This is how tech move forward.
lol
"XRB is a good examples of this. 

Instant transactions with 0 costs. Yes, I said instant. "
Right. Obviously there are levels of understanding to crypto currency. People that get it, people that see $$, and people that don't get it. 
">stop talking about BTC in /r/BTC

Really dude?"
EOS is being developed by block.one from scratch. The EOS tokens being traded today are an erc-20 coin on Ethereum but that will likely change in June as long as there is sufficient support for the idea. $5 billion and counting seems sufficient to me. [EOS.io](eos.io) to learn more. 
Or Doge
"That's cool. I don't know why you guys see it as not enough room for both and feel the need to attack Bitcoin all the time. I mean bcash is a fork, but Roger wants it to be called ""Bitcoin""... There's an army of you guys always talking about how Bitcoin is trash. I just. Dont. Get it. Tbh it feels like you all read from the same script. Wish you guys would just do your own thing."
Except everyone here is oblivious to big block resulting in a blockchain centralization if it were to gain large support. The entire point of bitcoin was it to be decentralized peer to peer currency. If the end game of BCH is centralization, then what is the point? It is just another fiat, but instead of being controlled by central banks, it is controlled by Chinese server farms with the hash rate to mine blocks, and the storage capacity to host nodes.
you also unanimously bch supporters
your big blocks are empty though
Really? Satoshi's white paper clearly states it is for peer to peer, and against centralization with his inscription on the first block. The end game of BCH/big blocks, is a blockchain with mining and nodes only the wealthy can afford.
Aren't articles like this supposed to make currencies *rise*?
No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Please don't forget that SegWit has changed the fundamentals of Bitcoin as well. If you want to be 100% real about it, neither BTC or BCH is the original Bitcoin anymore. 
"If blockstream/core wanted to change the vision of bitcoin, they should have chosen a new name for their project

> ~~bcash~~ blockstrean/core trying to ride on bitcoins coattails are problematic

FTFY. "
"BUT, he also said that full nodes would be accessible to many, in order to create an honest network. Big blocks increases the reduces the capability for the average person to host a full node, and vote for bitcoins future.

If you push large blocks, then the ability for the average user to host a full node is diminished which results in further centralization. 

This reduces bitcoin's capacity to act as a **peer to peer currency**. Read the white paper."
"Bitcoin cash is also pro-centralization. 

The entire purpose of BTC is to be decentralized. So even if BCH is more functional as a currency, what the fuck is the point? Use USD instead."
"The original use is for it to be peer to peer. Decentralized. BCH trades ease of use for centralization. Which, at that point, you should just use the USD if you favour ease of use.

BTC is currently hindered by TX fees/times. But is still accessible to all, as it is far easier to host a full node and vote on its future. BCH is transferring those voting rights to centralized parties as it would make hosting a full node more financially impractical for the average person.

BCH is headed in the same path as the tradition USD.
"
Ripple. It was actually developed a year earlier than Bitcoin.
We don't hate bitcoin, we hate the f*ckwits that have commandeered it. theres a massive difference. BCH has been created, so i guess the people will decide. or they may just use alts instead. Thats what happens when you turn a product designed for everyone, and put a massive expensive wall around it.
IKR, shitcoins like bcash trying to ride on bitcoins coattails are problematic, who'd have thought...
Mining is open to everyone .... development not 
"Satoshi predicted that Bitcoin mining would eventually be done exclusively by large server farms and that most end users would connect with SPV wallets. He didn't predict *one* company in control, but that's not what we have. We have multiple companies involved in mining both BTC and BCH, using large collections of dedicated servers, as Satoshi predicted. He predicted the mining industry pretty accurately; the only thing he missed is the existence of mining pools."
Nobody is stopping anybody to build their own mining farms and contribute to the hash power. 
"But it's endgame is centralized currency. Which is opposite of bitcoin. The vision of bitcoin is peer to peer. With full nodes being accessible to many, and them voting for its future. BCH favours centralization, and if it gained wide use, would limit full nodes to those who can buy server farms. Eliminating the point of BTC.

Yes, BTC is currently hindered by TX fees/time. But if you want a centralized currency, that currently works. Go use the USD. Since it is the BCH end game."
"If you look at what Satoshi wanted to achieve with bitcoin, then yeah bitcoin is objectively bad.

>**The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services.

Bitcoin was made specifically because of high fees of traditional online payment systems."
Core co-opted bitcoin and lied, **[censored](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)** and smeared all the way down as they drove it into the ground. **[$41](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html)** average BTC transaction fees, **[168,000](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions)** unconfirmed transactions... Segwit is suboptimal, Lightning won't work and re-engineering bitcoin into a settlement layer for the rich eliminates half bitcoin's utility and fundamental value. So Bitcoin Cash became bitcoin. No, Bitcoin Cash *is* what bitcoin was all along - before Core, Segwit and even the 1mb limit. Do you want to store value like gold *and* transact like cash, or create third-party **[Tabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7h26zy/adam_backs_tabs_idea_transcript/)** and **[centralized hubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g)** that Core's **[most prominent developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ctnog/reminder_many_of_the_bitcoin_core_developers_are/)** profit from? 
...they have no option, and in a way how can we even blame them,  they're simply people who missed the bitcoin boat through cowardice or bad judgement, or noobs with a get rich quick mentality who have no qualms with trying to steal value from the community that created bitcoin. All the hate for core etc is just how they rationalize away their contemptible actions in their own mind.
I've been in Bitcoin since 2011. How about you?
Litecoin is not bitcoin  .... and bitcoin cash is effectively bitcoin
"it will be fine... :)

https://www.bitcoincash.org"
Probably quite a few but the only one I know of is IOTA.
But one comp y has made it completely unprofitable, and centralized their machines. There's your sotashis vision.
It transacts.
"Every time somebody complains about high fees, the Core/Blockstream trolls come out in full swing, armed with some transactions **that still require high fees** but not so high as the one the complaint is about.

So if somebody thinks that $30 is too high, these trolls will point to an isolated example of a fee as low as $4.00 and claim that that is not high.

There are two big flaws in their trolling strategy. First, occasional lower fees mean nothing. Second, anything more than around $0.05 for a typical non-complex transaction is too high.

Look at the way Bitcoin used to be, when fees were in the $0.00–$0.06 range. Were it not for the tiny blocks that the Core/Blockstream trolls claim to worship, fees would still be in that range. 

----

Edit. Changed ""worship"" to ""claim to worship"". Even as they piously preach their anti-BCH gospel, these trolls are actually secretly using BCH and other coins for their transactions, and only pretending to favour Bitcoin."
A 4% transaction fee and uncertainty about the confirmation time is success? The average *credit card* transaction fee is [2.5 - 3%](http://instoredoes.com/making-cents-of-credit-card-processing-fees/). So BTC is less successful than credit cards, on a good day? Congratulations. 
Post your tx so users here can see it. 
You bet. Ethereum for one. 
> A fork is a term for a new version of a software program. Bitcoin is really nothing more than software, a program that allows two people to make an exchange of value. Because nobody owns that software, anybody can “fork” it, can create their own version of it. Bitcoin Cash **and all these other altcoins** are really just versions of the bitcoin program.
Etherium is a fork of Bitcoin in the same way that bit torrent is a fork of napster.
"Yeah, but there are a thousand alts out there. Everyone has a favorite coin :-)

I guess I tend not to be paranoid about myself (i.e. you can easily find out who I am) -- but I can *definitely* see the point of staying anonymous in this case: There is just so much noise one can handle.

Case in  point: I applied to the Ford Foundation once. They handle 50 thousand applications! Nobody wants to be on the reviewer board for that one: You know they are going to lose a lot of applications in the dust and they are going to accept a lot of nonsense -- the hope is that on average they will do well. 

So yeah, just select to spend these BTC as fast as you can and hope for the best. Put as many restrictions as needed and avoid all the bickering and nonsense.

I love your method of ending this over the holidays: Anyone working 9-5 on business days only won't even see this and that's the thing: you're looking for those who are willing to write an application on a holiday (in many countries...).

"Hi Pine  🍍, 
Hope you went through my comment which I emailed to you regarding screening some African based charities which are worth recommending and are definitely doing what they say they are doing in their communities ... As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.

There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations for the Pineapple Fund, which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.

"Thanks for clarifying this, and also considering exceptional cases!

I applied today, and have been running a charitable project for years but only just now working on the paperwork. It all seemed very intimidating to me, legally, and so many in the bay area have warned me not to as it would close off opportunities.

If the project I applied with appeals to you (Infino.me), please let me know! Having that feedback is immensely useful to us, and would definitely push us finally in that direction."

Then Satoshi invented something completely unsustainable
"I encourage you to listen to Tone Vays and follow his every word.  This pleases me.

That doesn't always work out you know...sometimes you can let scientific consensus be the better judge.  There are people that may mean well with your mindset that believe the moon landing was a hoax because they can't fully comprehend it and see what looks like tinfoil and a fake background.  And given Trump is our president, I'd rather believe in science than just judge everything myself when I am not remotely qualified, and lets face it, do really think you're qualified?  Have you contributed or looked at the code?  Did you understand it?  Then I'd have to ask why someone like Andreas Antonopolous is a proponent of a 2nd layer solution, on top of so many others that have written on the subject (of bitcoin and how it works), not to mention lightning network was peer reviewed and given the go ahead.  Just who are you to say it won't work?   
No it doesn't. It doesn't need to be centralized to a point of single bodies. Centralized enough that it is controlled by only a few and it is no longer what the whitepaper said was it's goal of **peer to peer**.
What the hell are you talking about? Stuffing more tx's into a single block has nothing to do with block rewards. 
"I think his idea was that block rewards would be enough to satisfy miners, while most people would not want to pay fees to ensure a super fast transaction time unless they were transferring an ungodly amount of money. 

In the white paper he discussed how the network could move to fees based mining once blocks stop giving rewards

Not necessarily unsustainable, but unlikely to play out that way looking back. "

OK. That's a sure way of introducing inflation.  Say Good bye to your 21 million cap 
"I can only imagine Bitpay merchants are eager to switch from BTC to BCH. 

As of now, explaining to customers that the BTC miner fee is larger than their refund can't be much fun."

"So BTC has increased in 1000% in value this year. It is ALL over the news - almost everyone has heard of it now.

Why are more and more business' moving away from it?

BCH has only been around for about 6 months, and there is a massive campaign slandering it...yet more and more business' are adopting it, why do you think this is?

So after a few months there will be “tons” of users who switch from Google to my search engine.  None will have switched from mine to Google - duh, I just started.  This does not constitute evidence that I am a threat to Google’s search.  

Point is, in the last 4 months, how many companies only accepted BCH?  Without that figure, this declaration is meaningless.  Context is everything."
Hey Rick - out of curiosity do you see a divide in the cypherpunk community around BTC/BCH? 
the thing to note here is they actively made fun of bcash. You should see this as .. well.. bad. Pirate bay is anti-corporate. They obviously see bcash as corporate. not good. for you.

Shill and troll are certainly overused words. 
"You can be a BCH shill for 0.10 USD u/tippr ;)"
True not all are shills, the others are useful idiots.  Much worse, since useful idiots don’t get paid.

[deleted]
Would you kindly provide any evidence? 
This interview is over. 
Roll for the completely unrelated suggestion.
"This is competent correct. There are only a few companies using BCH where many thousands using BTC. The companies using BCH will only have just started as they can't have been accepting it for long, so it's pretty unlikely any company would start on BCH and immediately move to BTC (especially as the fee's at the mo are crazy, and due to brand/amount of people with btc, they would either have started with both, or made the switch or choice recently due to fee's.
Stating there are lots of companies switching is fine and fair, but the comparison is a knowingly pointless addition (Kind of strawmanish) it adds nothing to the potent and simple point that there are companies switching"
"Thats assuming that the reason for increase in adoption is simply because it is new. I believe this is totally false, for all of the other reasons I have stated. It is even going against the huge network effect and first mover advantage btc has. His argument is trying to undermine the most plausable reasons for BCH's adoption

But you are right, I am putting this forward in an unpleasant way, I apologise"
"There are actually companies ""only"" withdrawing BTC support due to high fees and slow confirmation time, giving up completely on Bitcoin and cryptos.

We expect BCH to win them back in the near future."
I think you are completely misunderstanding what the point of the tweet is 
"It's not like he owns LTC, does he? And it's not like some guy can dictate what happens to a cryptocurrency. If it ever became a serious issue, people could, um, FORK it for block size increase and call it Litecoin Cash, you know? Then what would be left for BCH to brag about?

But my point is that here and now LTC is faster than both BCC and BCH, so claiming that it would face Bitcoin-level problems with same usage is disingenious. "
u/BCHShillTippr :)
"One funny thing about Bcash proponents is that they rely on droning ""muh 2mb blocks, low fees, practical solution"" 99% of the time, but when they're asked to provide evidence of superiority to anything except Bitcoin, they start spewing complete nonsense. Here you're attempting to blow smoke. 

Yes, algo less prone to getting network being controlled by large miners, 4 times the supply, 4 times faster blocks. You've also omitted functional segwit. Oh, and a functional dev team. Will you seriously claim that uninspired block size increase is somehow more impressive? 

Litecoin supports 56 tx per second. Bch – something below 40 (34, right?). In practice, LTC has 3600 tx/hour right now. BCH: 1287. Go on, blow more smoke. "
"> It's not like he owns LTC, does he? And it's not like some guy can dictate what happens to a cryptocurrency.

He sort of does, the same way that Satoshi did. There's no serious rival to his control of the coin.

> If it ever became a serious issue, people could, um, FORK it for block size increase and call it Litecoin Cash, you know? Then what would be left for BCH to brag about?

Have you not seen how harmful that's been for Bitcoin.

> But my point is that here and now LTC is faster than both BCC and BCH, so claiming that it would face Bitcoin-level problems with same usage is disingenious.

Roadmaps matter. Litecoin's is lacking. I wish the coin the best."
"> muh 2mb blocks

It's 8MiB, try and keep up kid

Regardlss, it's not nonsense to point out the consensus protocol and block time because they people who actually understand this tech know what that means. Maybe you can get someone from Blockstream to translate this into stupid for you"
Thats probably why companies are lining up to adopt segwit hahaha
"Yes I get your point - I am arguing that I believe it to be wrong

If coin B has much better utility than coin A, then that is why people are moving to it. Especially if coin A can not even be considered a coin anymore

Using your example also; if there is potentially billions of sites that have the opportunity of employing one coin, I feel that the few thousand sites coin A has over coin B due to its first mover advantage, is a negligible difference.
"
The tweet didn't say anything about the utility of either coin nor did it mention first mover advantage. It said that there were more moving one direction than the other. All I've been doing is pointing out the flaws in that logic, based on the arguments I've made in my comments.
It's like we're not speaking the same language as this guy... People read something that *might* be negative about their favorite coin and just go straight to irrelevant talking points.
"I'm not saying it's seeing increased adoption because it's new.

What I'm saying is that the reason there more people moving from BTC to BCH, instead of the opposite, is because there are considerably more people already using BTC. I thought I'd made this pretty clear.

Let me put it this way:
Coin A has 1,000,000 sites using it,
Coin B has 10,000 sites using it.

On average, wouldn't it be fair to say there's a greater number of sites moving from A to B, rather than from B to A, simply because there are 10x the number of sites using it?"
then why piss off people like that?

"Calm down.

He is only saying BTC has had about a decade to get businesses to adopt, whereas BCH has had a few months. So of course there will be more businesses moving from BTC to BCH simply because there are more businesses able to move in that direction."
"The whole point of the tweet was to say that ""a truckload"" of companies are switching from BTC to BCH, while ""zero"" are doing the opposite.

My point was simply that it's a stupid comparison to make because there's significantly more adoption of BTC across the web, given it's been around for years. 

All I'm saying is there are fairer, more rational ways to compare coins. BTC loses to BCH in essentially all comparable metrics, why not use them? These pointless comparisons give the indication of clutching at straws, weakening the case of the argument."
You raise a good point there.
"Its not like bcash is like calling anyone shitface, unless you are suffering from hypersensitivity.

Litecoin would have the exact same problems as Bitcoin if anyone was using Litecoin
Only thing I really don't like about this tweet is the fact he won't name these companies. Its like me claiming I own a lambo, but I won't show you or tell you where it is. Making claims like these are pointless if you can't back them up.
Yeah, I saw that note on the Bay. No worries. They'll come around, they want donations as much as the next guy.
What did Xapo do with the bcash they sold btw?
Yes, the second half of the tweet is a completely moot point which somewhat detracts from the message. There are probably no more than a handful of companies that exclusively adopted BCH in the last few months, certainly not enough to fill a truck.
The current price trends don't really reflect this.
"Litecoin, with 4mb blocks every 10 minutes, plus segwit and the potential for lightening etc is set up better than BCH. I hold approx 4 times as much BCH as LTC because i simply Hodl through the fork but i dont understand why people here debate this. 

From a stadnpoint of what i hodl i would love to see this happen but the math doesnt make sense to me "
"Incase you havent noticed...BTC is totally unusable

BCH has instant transactions for fees less than a penny

How do people leave THE most important thing out of their analysis? Usability."
"> Sort of a pointless comparison, no? BCH has been around for 4 months, BTC has been around for around 7 years.
> BTC has significantly more adoption than BCH so of course more people have the opportunity to switch from that direction.

Well there has been quite a few merchant leaving BTC over the last months.

It does show that coin has different purpose really.
"
"So, you come out with a new credit card system that works just like Visa and costs merchants .10% instead of their normal 1-3% and when businesses switch you're going to say its because Visa has more clients?

LOL

Sometimes I can't help but laugh at how the r/bitcoin community grasps at straws to validate a position that can't be argued using facts."
How could anybody move away from BCH when nobody is using it in the first place?! Oh my, that is statistical lies 101, a-hahahahaha! :-)
"LOLs.

Seriously, what an idiotic statement (the OP, not you)."
Well nobody is using bitcoin cash, so it's hard to get companies going in the other direction.
excellent
"Sort of a pointless comparison, no? BCH has been around for 4 months, BTC has been around for around 7 years.

"I would argue consensus is a hard fork like BCH where the participants have to agree to make it happen, we have consensus here, all participants of BCH have consensus and agree to what is happening with the currency.

SegWit was a sneaky code change, where the participants do not have much interest in and therefore it is barely used and even dictated to be used

Consensus means that things happen naturally out of free will, they can never have consensus in an manipulated environment, the consensus is broken by the censorship and manipulation.

Wikipedia says:
Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the ""favourite"" of each individual.

As you can see, they did not have consensus by the community, otherwise BCH would not exist... Their solution was not one that can be supported..."

It would be your own fault if you did not attach the proper license to your work. Btw open source doesn't mean free. 
That's how it's always worked on the open source world, Linux is a mix of Linus (the creator) and Unix (the OS it's based on). GNU means GNU is Not Unix. NetBSD had a fork named OpenBSD which has now completely replaced the original project. Mozilla Firefox Is a fork of Mozilla, Xorg from XFree, etc, etc, etc...
Hey man, not my words. I just copy pasted from the owner of Bitcoin.org
Forked to its intended use though? 
"SegWit is typically presented in a benign manner as simply a ""fix"" but it is thoroughly harmful to the Bitcoin codebase.  SegWit breaks the all important legal and security use cases of on-chain signatures.  This POS should have never been permitted to be committed .  The inventors and implementers of this POS should never have been custodians of Bitcoin.  They were saboteurs that undermined the entire project."
I was more speaking about the decision to implement segwit rather than the subreddit
"Real smooth, man, but you're not fooling anyone with this sophistry. Ubuntu is Linux, Arch is Linux, but you can't make a ""one true Linux"" out of a fork. You just make a fork, it's a question of priority, there is an original repository and one forked at a later point of time. Adoption, branding and legitimacy are independent issues that BCH crowd is desperately trying to tangle up. One quick check: should Bitcoin Gold also be considered true Bitcoin? If not, what makes BCH any truer?"
"I agree.  I was skeptical that Segwit would help, and I never supported it.  When it passed I thought it was bullshit, but I thought that they were rational and would increase the blocksize.  Instead, they bait and switched a good third of the community, completely alienated another third outright, and I would guess that less than 1/3 of users from last spring are even in favour of Core's fuckery.   Probably even less than that.  I'm now seeing the ""great leap forward"" for Segwit on the other sub, and it disgusts me.  I will never use Segwit, and I pray that they have not gone so far as to piss off the government to the point of regulating cryptos more heavily with their shananigans."
"> but you can't make a ""one true Linux"" out of a fork

How so? Linux Mint is one true Linux"
I'm not claiming BCH is the one true Bitcoin. There is not a good definition of bitcoin that everyone agrees on. The white paper is surprisingly vague on actual definitions. The changed pow on BTG makes your question a difficult one, but if it managed to get more computational power behind it than any other chain, then it would have a good claim. 
Ubuntu is as much one true Linux as BCH Is the one true Bitcoin. The analogy is perfect.
*Mic drop*
No, this is not how open source works, stop parroting complete nonsense without any thought. Imagine for an instant that you have forked somebody's work and claim not only the same name but priority. You'll be despised by whatever community this is happening in. 
Actually that's exactly how open source software forks work. Ubuntu is still Linux, just branded differently. There are other forks of Linux with Linux in the name.

>I’ve got a new coin for you, it’s like Bitcoin but it has RBF, high fees, and less secure signatures. No name for it yet, so for now we’re going to keep calling it Bitcoin. Btw here’s the original white paper, which has nothing to do with our new coin:
"A comment of Cobra in the same thread, after someone saying we stole the Bitcoin name:

That’s how open source works. People fork off and go a different path. Nobody has any actual right on the “Bitcoin” name. It’s annoying sure, but it would be worse to have some entity be in charge of how the Bitcoin name can be used."
Cobra's message is great, but very naive. Too much money on the line. Bashco obviously sold all his BCH and has a large vested interest for BCH to die.
I would argue that they have consensus, probably not informed consensus, but still consensus.
Thanks!!! Wow
You aren't getting what I intended to convey. It's more fleshed out in my other comnent. The current economy relies on constant consumer spending. If the working class can't go shopping that's a problem. We need far less consumption, but not a sudden recession. 
Yup.
"If a mob guy came in and invested heavily in Bitcoin's programming and then the whole thing crashed and we learned that the entire mob had plans to destroy bitcoin and take over crypto, no one would dismiss this as ""ridiculous & unfounded.""

"Fuck tax deductions and armies of accountants. There is no law of the universe that says there is only one shitty way to fund projects and cooperate.

I'm not an economist and just in the planning stage. But the idea is an economy based on consent, not coercion. We should look at other ways to share resources and organize labor. Some aspects would be a lot like crowdfunding, as a citizen you would have control of where a small chunk of public money ends up, split amongst projects. This mechanism should be balanced with some fixed budget items and other controls to stay predictible. This economy needs long term contracts with consistent funding.

When society is radically fucked I look for solutions outside the framework. Like a restart if and when a collapse or political revolution starts. I want to be ready and talking about a more humane common sense world.

If you don't draw 100% from the basic income it would go in a rainy day fund. If that gets big enough it could be another source of investment. In this investment system I am thinking about, there is no interest, maybe no inflation. The reward for a successful investment is you helped a good idea grow and the ongoing gratitude and favors voluntarily given back. If a venture is necessary and efficient, it turns a profit and can eventually return the seed money back to the investment pool for a new venture."

Pretty much. But let’s examine your proposals...


> People should be able to direct their tax money straight to programs and public investments that they choose. 


No, in general, average people cannot properly allocate money. We need better trained politicians. 


> We need a basic income (not welfare that goes away when you work) so automation is a blessing not a threat. Basic income keeps the economy more predictable, and money flows, therefore it is more efficient. 


This would possibly be nice. 



> A consumer economy needs consumers with disposable income.


Should we all consume more though? Wouldn’t that be a problem for the limits of growth? 


We’re rapidly liquidating the planet’s resources already, and your policies are 

1. to let people directly vote on tax law (how this would even work, who knows? Who makes the proposals people vote on? What makes you think average people are any good at all with allocating money? Have you seen their credit card bills?), 

2. and to encourage faster resource burn by incentivizing and allowing for rapidly increasing consumption. 

What, are you an accelerationist? Unless you’re an acceerationist*, this is a bad idea. 

*Accelerationists believe we’re all fucked so we might as well consume as fast as possible in order to bring on the inevitable collapse as fast as possible such that less people are affected by it when it comes. My opinion is that this is a horrible, selfish strategy. "
What specific action do they take to enforce the rules.
"How would this microfinance platform work? Are you referring to crowdfunding that is also tax-deductible?

We cannot designate where our taxes go, otherwise everything would be tax-deductible and would leave critical departments over/under funded. Congress I believe tries to mitigate the distribution of taxes.

In a way basic income is a way to bring down prices for everything, and if it helps my neighbors at all I would decline some if not all, because free money tends to have consequences for all (Especially those who depend on it)."
It doesn't ... yet.  At the moment it's in the taking-over-Bitcoin phase.  The profiting-off-Bitcoin phase is planned for later.  Amazon didn't make a profit for many years either ... until it did.

"Since you are investigating these connections I would like to suggest you look at the connections to the CIA and MI6 via the other VC firms which also invested in Blockstream. 

This is **pure speculation** but I suspect Adam Back and other core developers have been compromised by intelligence operations, they could be direct agents of CIA and MI6 either voluntarily for money and prestige or under duress or blackmail, for example Back was basically a disgruntled nobody who Satoshi had read his papers long ago and mentioned him, and then something happened well after Bitcoin had already been a huge success that had him suddenly involved and creating this company. Gavin was invited to discuss with CIA very early on, the Satoshi disappeared, he likely rebuffed any attempt to co-opt him, but we can all imagine how that would have been a much different conversation with Mr Back can't we? Do people really think only Gavin was approached? No it's just he has integrity and his ego under control and so he was transparent with it, others would have had their ego stroked and their childish fantasies played to. 

Oh course this will be hard to prove. What we need is a Wikileaks style release of some emails or some evidence. Perhaps we need a bounty for that?

Fuck off.
It doesn't hurt hodlers. It only hurts those who deliberately dump. Anyone who held one bitcoin 1-8 years ago holds one BCH, and they will hold one of everything that ever forks from the original ledger, including all subsequent spinoffs of BTC and BCH.

I'd encourage ground-up alternate implementations knowing damn well that the kind of people dumb enough to work on them expecting to create a viable competitor anytime soon aren't going to succeed. Every time anyone tried mining with one, I'd use my knowledge of all the ways they are incompatible to fork them, making it clear they can't be trusted for mining. Then I'd go a step further and ""for the good of Bitcoin"" create a process by which regular soft-forks and hard-forks happened so that Bitcoin can be ""improved"" in various ways, maybe every six months. Of course, I'd involve those alternate implementations in some IETF-like standards process for show, but all I would have to do to keep them marginalized and the majority of hashing power using the approved official implementation is slip the odd consensus bug into their code; remember how it was recently leaked that the NSA spends $250 million a year on efforts to insert flaws into encryption standards and commercial products. With changes every six months the alts will never keep up. Having accomplished political control, the next step is pushing the development of the Bitcoin core protocol in ways that further my goals, such as scalability solutions that at best allow for auditing, rather waiting until protocols are developed, tested, and accepted by the community that support fully decentralized mining.

If you’ve noticed since the Bitcoin Cash fork a plethora of new forks which have mostly been airdrops and some just plain scams have popped up. This has all been orchestrated to try to fear people until thinking forks in general are bad to try to discredit Bitcoin Cash. 

As we also already know they created this soft fork process to also try to discredit hard forks and introduce buggy code like SegWit making it difficult for any forks to maintain (thankfully Bitcoin Cash devs had the foresight to fork before SegWit was activated). 

There is also a lot of code creep that has been cleaned up in Cash, for example RBF which is a disaster in combination with the new 14-day mempool eviction policy. 

Lastly regarding scalability, we have Lightning (Coming Soonish) which has delayed scaling for ages in the hopes of a working system which will undoubtedly morph into a hub and spoke network that is perfect for auditing centralized players. "

Gregory Maxwell on February 28, 2017 at 03:00 said:

Wow. Another remarkably dishonest article from the authors of Bitcoin Unlimited. (http://archive.is/5cim0 Archive link)

> because only some coins can

Making your transactions non-malleable is a thing you always opt-into because some forms of mallability are an intentional and useful feature. With a segwit using wallet you get non-malleability by default, you can choose to not have it by using things like sighash flags. Obviously if you don’t use a segwit wallet you don’t get the segwit benefit. There is no fungiblity interaction here– any coin can be sent to a segwit wallet and any coins in a segwit wallet can be sent to any other wallet, so that claim is simply untrue.

> SegWit absolutely fails to solve anything related to quadratic hashing.

Again, a complete untruth. Segwit makes transaction hashing strictly linear in the size of the transaction. There is no quadratic component at all, and the hashing CPU time for all transactions with multiple inputs is significantly reduced. Because segwit is backward compatible it doesn’t change older transactions (and couldn’t, without risking confiscating funds) but that is okay because segwit doesn’t increase the capacity for older transactions.

> It adds a new attack vector,

Dishonest miners being able to make malicious blocks that bloat the system isn’t a new attack, but segwit makes the attack better by reducing the much more serious UTXO (https://segwit.org/why-a-discount-factor-of-4-why-not-2-or-8-bbcebe91721e#.qofkg369f bloat attack vector).

I think this point is especially dishonest coming from a BU developer, given that their whole security model is based on a strong assumption that the aggregate behavior of miners is honest. It’s like a guy who sells houses without doorlocks on the basis that people are honest complaining that someone was lowering their security replacing their deadbolt with a combination fingerprint scanner + key lock where the key was somewhat easier to copy.

> LN strongly incentivize centralization

The description given there actually argues the opposite. The funds in channels are required based on the number of channels. Lightning designs today are setup to only build channels as a product of payments you’re already making. Using lightning in a “hub like” way requires extra transactions that you never would have made normally. The big advance of lightning over the prior payment channels proposals is specifically that it doesn’t need hubs.

Recently BU’s “chief scientist” was making exactly the opposite argument based on the same facts: He argued that lightning did not improve scalablity because there would need to be as many channels as users and so when users went up the channel count would go up.

> full blocks equals stealing

This isn’t true– blocks are _always_ effectively full and any system where they aren’t is either irrelevant or subject to censorship. Bitcoin’s incentives depend on full blocks (https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a5), as well.. Lightning works fine in the presence of full blocks, and moreover lightning is largely orthogonal to segwit.

> Schnorr cannot deliver any extra capacity

This is simply untrue. Our construction for schnorr aggregation on top of segwit yields over 24% additional capacity in the limit with two outputs and infinitely many inputs, this number is nearly achieved with realistic numbers of inputs like 10 (which achieves a 24.6% capacity increase).

So we have each and every point raised in this blog post are untrue, many absurdly so.

Finally, the untrue claims in this blog post are being plastered all over rBTC but due to actions (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1802320.0) by that subreddit’s moderators I am unable to post a counterargument– not just on rbtc– but anywhere on Reddit. Yet they happily scream about far less limiting actions a censorship.

"Of course people are working on it. We could have guessed that from the fact that many people still believe in the Core story, as is obvious from the BTC price. That doesn't mean they aren't working on a fool's errand. 

This is actually what happens in just about every field: once the best status-seekers enter, they try to create a new paradigm where no further advancement is possible, either by focusing everyone's attention on go-nowhere projects that don't rock the boat of their paradigm (and hence their position) or by mucking up the language and model so much that controversy is endless (and they can squat on the project saying ""no changes without consensus!""). 

Both methods keep everyone beholden to them as the leaders, and Core has followed the playbook to a T."

This way the government and it's corporate friends can profit on the ignorance of people that still support an obviously compromised coin. I was just having a discussion in another thread with a trader saying that bitcoin has been compromised for years already and the big players just see it as a way to make money off of idiots.
"Then why are you asking me if we should ""support the infiltrators""? At least be consistent in your trolling"
"I think the jury is still out. For one person's transaction it may not matter so much but for the next person down the line they may see a backlog forming (or formed) and need to raise their transaction fee to compete for block space; with high volatility price speculators also are looking to transact quickly to and from exchanges. Also, I don't think too many people actually use RBF yet but RBF + long eviction time frames could be problematic and contribute to higher fees in the future. "
One of the reasons Core is going for 1MB+2nd layer is because it'll make it impossible to *opt out* of the system, eventually. Think about it. People won't be able to trade their BTC, only to spend the available ones to another BTC *user*.
"Too low fee transactions stay in the mempool for 14 days, previously they were evicted after maybe one day, don't remember exactly.

When a transaction is evicted, the transaction appears to never have happened, and the payer is free to try another transaction with the same coins.
"
and yet here you are caring.... lmfao whos dumber?
What are you North Corean trolls looking for in our uncensored sub? Expose your downvoted BS to the voters?
Still not answering my question 
That's a poor reason. Investors- at least smart ones- can see through that. I would never invest in anything primarily motivated by spite. 
Somebody knows thier *limits*
Don't get the wrong idea. I don't mind if Core manages to have actual success with its vision (rather than just short-term price dominance), I just find it extremely improbable given the direction they are heading. If they can solve NP-hard LN routing and other conceptual problems, they will have solved something that was never a problem but that some people might like anyway. It just enriches original hodlers even more, regardless of whether it was a Hail Mary.
"But would that not open precedent for more forks in the future? I mean there are now 21 million bitcoin cores and 21 million bitcoin cash. It can't be a good thing that this limited coin supply now has doubled. I still see the fork as a long consensus fight ... and I hope only one of the two survies. If Bitcoin Core gets fixed ... it it's them I am fine with it. But for that to happen they need to loose their political control. Vinay Gupta said it best: 

Bitcoin has political problems rather than technical problems and as long as they are unwilling to admin that, they are stuck.

I think we ARE willing to admit it. And so the solution for now is better politics. Better community building. Better creation of markets. Etc etc. Let Bitcoin Cash focus on user adoption.

But next to that there is another thing that is making every get stuck. The high volatility of prices because of fraud on the crypto exchanges. With this type of volatility no crypto is usable as a currency.

So for 2018 I hope two things. 

- That the fraud on the exchanges get's exposed and that the market corrects back to a more realistic price .. and hopefully another 4 years of a slow rise in price. The 4 years from Mtgox till now where a waste because the project stalled for almost 4 years. After the next MtGox (believe me it's coming) we have the opportunity to keep the price somewhat stable. 

- Leave Bitcoin Core behind for them to become obsolete and loose their political power. 



So we will have to:

1) Spread enough crypto around so there will be an inflow of people that want to use crypto as currency instead of a get rich quick scheme

2) Focus on websites like yours.org and initiative like the brave browser. Crytpo can help end the reign of ads on the internet. Direct funding. Direct contact between content creator and consumer without the ad cmpanies and banks and the other 1000 guys in between. 


3) Hire people over the internet and pay them in crypto so you start getting a real economy going.


This is kind of a quick shit post but you get the general idea.

Crypto is in slavery to fiat. The fiat price is what makes things do forward or backward. The only way to end this is there to be an economy of people getting paid in crypto and buying what they need with crypto.  This will be a very long process and crypto and fiat will have to co-exist for a long time.

But here are no shortcuts here... if we don't focus on building an economy like this nothing will ever happen with crypto because it just won't become money.

Legitimate question: at this point what would a successful legacy Bitcoin look like? 
I am supportive of both forks, but prefer Bitcoin Cash for myself. I see no problem with banks running Bitcoin Segwit. They'll screw it up eventually, but that could be decades away and buys us time to educate people on what money is and controlling their own.

"I support any reference client which follows the protocol of the whitepaper I'm familiar with and the vision and commentaries of the original developer.

Even **if** all the leaders of the resistance are crooks I'd still support them instead of corporate whores in bitcoin core.

**Just because their software is compliant.**"
"And I'm fine with that attitude.
What I don't like seeing is the whole ""BTC is BAD, only BCH is good, BTC is going to crash!"" attitudes.

And sadly, this is an attitude advocated, and propagated by Roger, who, whether people like it or not, is the spokesperson for BCH.

I don't think it raises the fees so much, but it creates a bit of confusion. With varying prices, it could be attractive to let the transaction wait until a the queue disappeared and prices lower, like weekend. Personally I would like a short eviction time, if people want to wait, republishing could be implemented in the wallet.

">previously they were evicted after maybe one day,

The previous policy was 3 days, now it's 14 days. You can read the logic here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9312 

>3 days (the old time) was already not sufficiently short to protect against an attack that could fill the mempool with high fee rate txs that were somehow not attractive or possible to mine. A longer expiry time will reduce network traffic by less rerelay of low fee txs and will allow transactions to take advantage of weekly cycles in tx volume. By keeping the txs in the mempool, future revisions of fee estimation will be able to provide lower estimates for transactions which are low priority and can wait days or a week to be included in a block.

Very peculiar logic if you ask me. Why would they say transactions with high fees are an attack? Ok, if the transaction is ""not attractive"" (whatever that means) or not possible to mine, the miner would just discard those transactions. The high fees all of a sudden would make the miner mine them? What? In addition, by creating extremely long wait times in the mempool guess what they are doing - yes! - creating an artificially super induced high fee rate market! Doh. "

"Actually, look at what IP addresses a Bitcoin node connects to (its hard-coded in the c++, points to something called DNS Seed Server) and ddos or attack those servers, which help the node find other servers.

I've been meaning to post a separate thread about this. The DNS Seed is just used for discovery for first time the Bitcoin full node is run (that's my understanding from browsing tons of articles and Reddit) so this wouldn't affect existing nodes but would hamper new nodes on the network.

If nodes can't find each other, then there's no network. "

"We can read the comments there, why quoting such a huge post? It got also refuted, but this you didn't quote.

Anyone can see the problems with maxwell counter argument, for instance:

> This isn’t true– blocks are always effectively full and any system where they aren’t is either irrelevant or subject to censorship. Bitcoin’s incentives depend on full blocks (https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a5), as well.. Lightning works fine in the presence of full blocks, and moreover lightning is largely orthogonal to segwit.

This is plainly false in all possible levels as we are seeing now. Full blocks is an amazingly stupid thing. Joseph Poon, creator of the general concept of LN, advised that blocks should have 133 MB afaik.

His arguments are basically stating false things as they were true. The first sentence makes no sense at all."

"> * Promise some solution in the future.
> * Never deliver.

This is not really true. If you'll have a look at the github repo for bitcoin you'll see that the devs are working hard even through christmas, and that one of the biggest things they are working to have in the upcoming 0.16.0 release is built-in SegWit address creation in the Core client, SegWit being the thing that has been promised (and included a long time ago, but not with a Graphic User Interface in the core client). I know SegWit is controversial for many people, but it doesn't really change anything except the structure of the transaction, and interestingly increases the block size, although in a bit of a different way compared to a hard fork.

Here is a link for the included issues that will make up the 0.16.0 release, along with the current development status:

Will they move on to BCH next and hinder the tx malleability fix to stop Bitcoin Cash getting optional LN?
It's truly impossible to determine if their goal is to co-opt or sabotage. Either way, it's hostile.
No, I'd also go on a dog and pony show to solicit hundreds of millions of DOLLARS,, like Blockstream did in some remote wooded cabin in 2013, where I'd court banker investment with the hard sell that I controlled Bitcoin development and direction because I've been successful in getting all the key core dev contributors, esp /u/pwuille, to join my company. I'd also throw in some salacious details about how I proved Bitcoin can't work citing some unseen unpublished paper in the past or that I invented Hashcash which is just Bitcoin with inflation control. I'd throw in that the bankers couldn't lose because in the off chance that Bitcoin did succeed, I'd insert a control mechanism (1mb4eva) that would divert lucrative tx fees offchain to centralized entities that you could control and skim fees from, like sidechains or LN hubs or federated servers (all can be spun up for virtually free without having to engage in pesky expensive mining). That way you could get rich or use it to outright kill Bitcoin, your choice.

6. Make it 100x easier to put money in than to get it out. 
And you forgot, go and work on other projects like ethereum and litecoin and recommend them for transactions because btc is “store of value”. Sheep still believes..
"How to attempt to destroy Bitcoin:

- Divide & conquer community using false narratives, astroturfing campaigns, CNBC buddies & fake Satoshi. Pay $500k per month if need be.
- Have you minions downvote anything you want out of sight, but cry censorship as much as possible.
- Be fine with centralized mining
- Abolish full nodes & concentrate power in those miners
- Push through any changes you like wether or not there is consensus
- Deliver poor quality code & run the project into the ground

And don't forget to convince yourself that you're effectively on a mission by ~~God~~ Satoshi himself. Be very emotionally invested in your ideas and defend them against contradictory facts in any way possible. Play the victim while doing it and during the inevitable aftermath."
"I'll address each point

1. It's not unusable. You pay and your transaction goes through. You can debate about the amount of fees being paid (and they are absurd) but you cannot say it's unusable.

2. Yes, there are solutions coming. LN is currently on testnet and is fully functional there. Feel free to go test it out yourself.

3. It's already delivered on testnet. When your objective is to get things RIGHT rather than get them out ASAP, it can take a long time. Bitcoin wants to change the world forever - not in the next 6, 12, or 18 months. 

4. I agree r/bitcoin is way too censored. Even though I think BCH is a poorly thought out solution to the scaling problem and Bitcoin is way better positioned to fix the scaling problem (therefore I'm a huge bitcoin supporter), you can still have plenty of discussion about fees over there. I personally support a 2mb hardfork and wrote about it on r/bitcoin here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jqs9m/how_much_longer_are_we_going_to_pretend_we_dont/

Can you not attack Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver and stand up for Bitcoin on its own merit? Crypto is not about people, it's about tech.
I haven't had a chance to do the proper reading, but from what I have gathered so far I do not believe that to be the case for transactions to/from the same wallet. 
I thought the forks were just clinical attempts to profit from the rise in popularity and the wealth they’d seen magicked out of thin air with bitcoin cash. 
Yea sure bug debunk was a top priority in bcash. Asicboost for example.
"Woa, this guy has been listening to too much Alex Jones.

Keep forking if anything goes wrong with a dev team gaining control. It is now a proven model. Forking works. It's the governance mechanism, even written in the whitepaper.
">BTC is going to crash!"" attitudes.

The ""BTC is going to crash!"" attitudes are legitimate whether you are pro- or anti-Bitcoin. There are warning signs of a large bubble at hand, and if true, that bubble doesn't care where either of us sit in the argument.

> ... he's the one going on TV interviews and saying how BTC is flawed, etc, instead of just saying what's good about BCH.

Why should he just say what is good about BCH and not also say what is flawed with the current market leader? Does that make sense to you in any other arena?"
This is the usual Core cultist tactic, you're accusing the bch community of the very crimes that your Cult has been doing.

"He publicly discredited anti-Bitcoin, which is what the BTC chain is.

- Bitcoin integrated the witnesses on purpose, BTC segregates them. 

- Bitcoin was to have giant blocks, BTC is to have micro-blocks only. 

- Bitcoin didn't have non-miners playing any role in security or decentralization, BTC does - especially with Segwit. In fact Bitcoin deemed too many non-miners as a Sybil attack, whereas BTC embraces these Sybils. 

- Bitcoin had all sorts of opcodes for smart contracts, blinded signatures, and just about everything any altcoin is doing, BTC has those opcodes disabled. BCH is bringing them back.

The name Bitcoin, as a chain, clearly applies to BCH far more than BTC. BTC is essentially the opposite on several key points of the system, thus anti-Bitcoin. (As a ledger, BTC+BCH *is* the Bitcoin ledger; a spinoff can be anything at all, and may hodlers benefit (and never lose) from the experimentation.)"
The last point is in reference to the massive troll army out there attacking anyone who would dare support the original vision for Bitcoin.
Thing is they need a fee market to force people into LN but then LN needs reliable and predictable transaction confirmation, something which contradicts the way they created their fee market.

"It's a very interesting post that [one by Peter Todd](https://web.archive.org/web/20140511085627/https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/483-bitcoin-dark-wallet/page__st__20#entry5410).  I want to give my two cents. 


>He's right, but the way he's right is not at all the way you probably think he's right: Bitcoin mining can and almost certainly will be regulated, and by regulating mining you regulate all use of the Bitcoin protocol.

>The first problem is ASICs, specifically the huge gulf in performance per unit cost between commodity hardware, or even hardware possible to create on a small scale with FPGAs, and ASICs. The nature of IC manufacturing is such that a very small number of companies, about two to three, can afford the immense capital costs required to operate top-of-the-line chip fabrication facilities. Put another way, the entire world's economy is unable to support a diverse IC manufacturing industry at the current level of technological sophistication.

And this why many people say that one of Bitcoin's mistakes was either it's choice of algorithm for mining or proof of work altogether. The problem is that when proof of work first became alive nobody knew if it was going to work either. In code yes, in human beings: only time can tell. And so there are lots of alternative now, I especially like Proof of Stake. However there is no simple way of telling if they can work like how proof of work has done it's job for the last 8 - 9 years. And maybe proof of work only works for like 20 years or so. How would we know? This is what makes crypto so bloody mysterious and interesting. We are all blind man trying to get a hold of a future that can't be seen or tasted yet ... and this is what ironically makes me the same as even the richest miner. His power can end really quickly and I don't have any. And we both don't know shit. 






>Control those chip fabs and you control mining. It would be extremely easy for the US government to tell Intel and TSMC that from now on any wafers they process capable of doing Bitcoin mining must include additional circuits that let the US government control how, and by whom, they are used. This is a problem in general with computing, but controlling the manufacture of a special-purpose ASIC is far easier and simpler, both technologically and politically, than controlling the availability of general purpose computing hardware. Fortunately it is possible to create proof-of-work algorithms where custom ASICs have less of an advantage over general purpose hardware, but Bitcoin itself isn't going to change the algorithm.


My two cents here is that it's way easier for any goverment to attack the weakest links, those will always be human beings rather then going after the hardware manufacterrs. The first you can do kind of covert and all the tools are known to work very well. Disinformation, propaganda, censorship, etc etc.  Crypto just is not posing a threat yet for any government to drop paratroopers at chip manufacturers. And we still don't know who Satoshi is. It might be a goverment that saw crypto as something inevitable to come and wanted to make sure that they would be in a position to swap old power for new power. Satoshi otherwise is one hell of damned discipline/principled person not having moved a single coin. 


>The second problem is bandwidth: the Bitcoin protocol has atrocious scalability in that to mine blocks you must keep up with the bandwidth used by all transactions. The current 1MB blocksize is small enough to make this not a major problem yet, but if you increase that (with a hardfork!) at some point you will have increased it to the level where you can no longer mine anonymously and then regulating miners directly becomes possible. Unfortunately while technological improvements have made non-anonymous bandwidth more plentiful, for anonymous bandwidth - or even just censorship resistant bandwidth - the options are much more limited. Jurisdiction hopping is an option, but even for the likes of The Pirate Bay it's proved to be a huge pain in the ass, and they only had the relatively small media industry as their enemy rather than the much larger banking industry. (and government in general) It does appear that you could make a crypto-currency with better core scalability - as opposed to the well understood and already-used ways to fairly securely transfer funds off-chain - but no-one's quite yet figured out yet how to upgrade Bitcoin itself with those improvements.


I do think that this might eventually become a problem but not right now. Just look at the massive amount of bandwith that filesharing and pornography is responsible for. However having the banking industry as your enemy is not something fun. Those have the power to take out whole countries!  But even they can't take down the entire internet, they are to much depended on that internet already. If p2p filesharing can find a away. If Chinese people are able to find a way around the Great Chinese Firewall then crypto will find a way to. However it does give an advantage to miners with better access to bandwith. Ironically most miners are in china where bandwith is way lower then in the west, precisely because of this Great Chinese Firewall.  But Bitcoin can work any network! If enough money is at stake what is to stop a mining company from using something like Satellite internet? High latency but the bandwith both in up and download can be quite high especially if you have an entire satellite for yourself. So all though it's very possible that the banking industry would put pressure on internet provides to block bitcoin traffic ... it's would be a very very tough fight. It's way easier again to again the people. To prevent good community building, to prevent crypto from becoming a money in the first place. All these super grand scheme attacks are not something to be worried about now. They all depend on a future where crypto goes global as a form of money. That does not happen automatically and nobody know if it's going to happen. Changing the mindset of what people believe is money and what is good money and what is better money ... that's the battle that first need to be fought. 


I think that the most viable way for crypto to succeed is to find a way to co-exist with the current fiat system. To offer something to goverment and citizens that can be an addition to the fiat system without being to much a threat.

That's why it needs to become the money of the internet first ... long before it tries to become the money of internet.

The money of the internet is a threat to paypal and visa but the internet of money is a threat to the entire current fiat system and the people that have the power there.  

**Conclusion: Crypto needs to go covert and infiltrate banking and the current fiat system or at least offer something to them so they want to partner up without seeing it as threat or takeover. How: I have no clue. But the powers that are won't allow a threat to grow and become a bigger threat. So the only way is for crypto to be an invisible threat that they don't see as one.**  If the current fiat system has pilars where crypto can take over those pilars ... so that some of the support of the fiat system will be carried by crypto. Then the fiat system can't destroy crypto without crippling itself. Similar to the internet. No power can take it down without becoming seriously crippled themselves. 

So the REAL REAL QUESTION IS: How does crypto become so important so that the powers that are become to depended on it to take it down? Can crypto tempt the bankers for them to become even  more rich? Can crypto offer the least powerful bankers a future where they become the most powerful bankers? There must be something!!!!

This whole BCH vs BTC tug of war will not end well. Both of the coins will fail, and take the entire crypto market down with them. The market will recover (months to years later), but only after expunging anything with Bitcoin in its name. Something with better technology will come along that doesn't feel so desperate and corrupt.
Yup. Even without all the overwhelming evidence supporting this, the writing's on the wall.

Let them destroy BTC so BCH may replace it.  Helping to destroy BTC will bring BCH to everyone more rapidly.

Btc became dysfunctional , it's objectively bad.
"> ""[...] BTC is going to crash!"" attitudes.

I don't own BTC nor BCH, but this is legitimate  concern and IMO has nothing to do with which coin you support.

It's impossible for the price to go like that forever so there are two possibilities:

- bitcoin is overvalued, this means it is a bubble, it will eventually bust, could be today could be in a year or more
- bitcoin is undervalued, this means the price change is justified, but it also means that once it reaches it real price it either will go to the first point and become overvalued or it will stop growing. The question is how will people behave once that will happen."
I think the Core group has done a very fine job of making themselves look bad. Too many of us have been censored. No body likes to be censored. 
The airdrops and even scams aren't hurting the BTC+BCH ledger. Todd had an idea but missed the easiest attack vector, which is the very opposite to what he thought: to try to make it *hard* to fork. That way, you create a centralized point of attack, and all you need is a guy who's good at social manipulation to weasel his way into the one monolithic dev team and push out everyone who disagrees.

"There is a logical reason BTC can't succeed: This is a fiercely competitive environment. Any chain that artificially and massively hamstrings itself for no actual benefit simply cannot hope to compete for very long. (They this is not investment advice, as maybe it can compete for ""longer than you can stay solvent."")

Once commercial network effect and first-mover advantage are widdled away by gargantuan fees, the monetary network effect cannot compete with a superior spinoff on its own, as the spinoff shares the same monetary network effect as it is a pure ledger-copy. That is why BCH is a thing. "

Meh, it's not my personal experience. But we've all got our biases, don't we? Time will tell.

If it's any consolation, I 100% agree with you. With a tail emission built into the social contract of monero, expensive fees shouldn't be a part of the equation to ensure its security. They need to come down drastically for it to ever succeed beyond a hobbyist weed currency.

"We'd benefit from lower fees on Bitcoin, too. But as a technical person, and as someone deeply involved with Monero, I understand that cutting fees does not magically solve the problem. There are no shortcuts to scaling, and whilst we always want to keep Monero mainchain accessible we also need to avoid making it so ""accessible"" that people start using it as virtually free decentralised data storage.

Also, Monero already had an aggressive spam attack in 2014, which was used to also exploit a treehash bug, and we had to raise fees as a result. The current fee algorithm is based on those learnings.

Incidentally, I don't expect that we'll cut the base fee for the March hard fork. I suspect we'll leave it as is, and then evaluate based on how things go from March to June (next code freeze)."

This is true. Piratebay does though.
">Here's a core dev sticking it to fluffy for being an asshole about on-chain scaling 

Sticking it? He just said bulletproof will reduce transaction size, and proceed to agree with fluffy in his next sentence. You can see how fluffy even +1000'd his comments. By the way, smooth is one of the people who says there is nothing wrong with current fees. He already name called me several times and believes people are paying high fees to skew the average transaction fee. Lol.

> but here's a second one where you didn't

that's not a developer. I didn't say the entire community was ok with the unnecessary high fees, though most of the community and most of the developers are

> another dev categorically rejects all the bullshit that's going on with Bitcoin Core

ok, that's a developer standing against bitcoin core, it was good to read that

Like you and I already said, I think the major breakpoint will come with the bulletproof fork. It will reduce transaction size for single output transactions by 82%. Therefore, the fee should be reduced by 82%. There are only 3 outcomes to this: developers keep the fee per byte, and the fee drops 82%, developers increase the fee per byte decreasing bulletproofs benefits, developers decrease the fee per byte, improving even further the transaction fee decrease by bulletproof. this would naturally be the best outcome as even with bulletproof we will still have expensive transaction.

Cost is one very important aspect of moneyness. I'd very much like to see monero triumph with a perfect fungibility and $10+ transaction fee. Sorry, no way in hell that will happen. I'll not be expecting 2 and half years of stalling and lies like blockstream did to bitcoin core. I will fork monero myself if it comes to that, and I will not care if nobody follows it and is priced at $0.0001, at least I will have done my part. An year has already passed. Time is of the essence in crypto. Monero is not an PnD altcoin and I truly believe it's got to make a dent in mankind. It is what bitcoin was supposed to be, and is turning into what bitcoin core has become.

Before bulletproof appeared in november, all the developers I talked to expressed no concern with the growing fee. I am very much concerned that if BP didn't come out they would still be very finely holding the same thought.

By the way, here's something [I found in one of your links](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k94q6/the_lead_developer_of_monero_wont_answer_my/drcn56v/)"
That’s true, but still inefficient.
Dumb bot
And who controls Bitcoin ABC?
Can you elaborate on that?
You're welcome. 
It's also a top 10 coin with no technical reason. They too also don't have a million dollar marketing team and brand confusion being their underlying model either.
"I see. Couldn't we have it where they pick a fee and then get a randomly generated fee within a certain percentage of that number?

For example, if someone wants a fee of .001, have it randomly generate a fee between .0009 and .0011. So they still get the freedom to pick basically whatever fee they want without it being exactly the same every time."
So tell me, who personally chose the EDA fix for the November hard fork ? 
"Some crypto-currencies are innovative (like Monero), but none are so overwhelmingly better than fiat that they caused a social revolution like how the iPhone changed the smartphone industry.

Good money should not have transaction costs directly dependent on code developers making changes."
"It's only 1/4 on the witness data portion of the Tx. Part of the Tx is in the legacy block and there is no discount on that portion. So overall the discount on a transaction is nothing like 75%, at least for regular txs that people do. I suspect you knew this though ;)

[Edit : typo]"
You know you've won a discussion with the butt-hurt monero crowd when these kind of replies pepper their responses to you. 
The magnets function the same as a torrent file though, but instead of the data being stored on your harddrive and accessed by whatever torrent program you use, it's piped straight from your browser to said program. if the torrent data is tainted, both methods will reveal you. Magnet links do not protect you.
So significantly lower risks, sounds good. Thanks!
Lightning is fine if the blockchain still functions. The problem with BTC is that lightning will be the only way to transact.

Don't bother. I tried asking on that subreddit how Monero plans to address their high fees, and they were complete jerks about it. I'm sure they'd react even less well to this.
"Crully is right! *only* ~$10 at the lowest point in fee market history since the  recent peak. It’s in its way back up again.

Not really the full story though it’s an isolated incident and is representative of big picture.

You can see it’s a local low point if you look at https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#3m

You can also see the trend. Each low is higher than the previous. The general behaviour is escalating. 

Mean/median is ok for past data, but at any given moment what it takes to get into next block is probably the best “current fee” ie 3rd chart down in Johoe look at where 1MB cutoff is.
"
Yeah I wish they were pushing it sooner but it makes sense to wait until the scheduled hardfork rather than to start emergency forking.
"Basically, if an user uses the same ""peculiar"" fee every time, an observer would be able to link his transactions. For example, if an user always uses a fee of 0.123456789 then it'd be fairly easy to spot which transactions are presumably his. "
bitcoinABC ? 
Not really. There are companies which monitor piratebay and use the distributed tracking to see who is sharing. Best not to run a torrent client from your home IP unless you know your ISP doesn't cooperate. (legal torrents are fine, of course).

"This is a bizzare straw man argument that I keep seeing. What was Big Block supporters' big problem with Bitcoin a few weeks ago? ""You can't buy a cup of coffee!!!! Fees are too high for small txs!!!!! Not a useful currency!!!!!"" 

Okay, we'll have off chain payment channels for cups of coffee and for other $5 USD transactions. The goal is tiny value transactions so there will be countless payment channels to route a cup of coffee.

The big block supporters' response, ""Noooo, only JP Morgan Chase and Warren Buffet have access to cup of coffee-level resources."" 

Don't you see how strained an argument that is? Clearly there will be hubs to some degree but just because a guy draws 2 big ones on a yellow piece of paper doesn't mean that's what it will look like. If I draw a hub that is a graphic designer sitting at his computer will we all feel better about it?

What real advantage do big bankers have over anyone else at becoming a ""hub"" that needs 0.005 BTC to cover cups of coffee sized transactions?"

Sure maybe it will change in the future but right now, I can definitely tell you bch fees are lower.

Here's my issue with your **certainty about an imminent fork away from mainstream monero**: you've spent a lot of time describing how toxic Spagni is. The funny part is that I'm [the biggest critic of Spagni](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k94q6/the_lead_developer_of_monero_wont_answer_my/drcor6l/?context=3) (and I [won't make you look through my history to corroborate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k0468/fyi_many_altcoin_subreddits_are_also_heavily/draojfl/?context=3)), and I don't agree with your conclusion. 

I'm not seeing at all how the other devs are [on onboard with a permanent fixed high fees situation](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/11/A-note-on-fees.html), at least not all of them. And this makes your whole other hypothesis regarding the desire to scale ""using mainly L2"" crumble. [Here's a core dev sticking it to fluffy for being an asshole about on-chain scaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7dnfdh/what_are_the_current_plans_for_longterm_scaling/dpzk2z0/?context=3) (a discussion you yourself participated in, [but here's a second one where you didn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcii2m/?context=3)), and one you might have missed where [another dev categorically rejects all the bullshit that's going on with Bitcoin Core](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/74slqm/xmr_scaling_debate_s/do10g8w/?context=3).

Wait, how is it 'idiotic' to blame your community when two members of it participated in this event? And its not like its a one-off, the Monero community has had no problem with shady tactics like this before and since that incident.
Lying about DNM adoption, lying about monero's privacy (claiming its the #1 privacy coin when its the only coin to have its privacy broken for 80% of its existence), etc. So pointing that out, and showing how its been ongoing since basically the start of your community is a very pertinent thing to do.

>I'm sorry if formal logic isn't your strongsuit;

You had best be careful, I am CLASSICALLY TRAINED AND MAKE MY MONEY using formal logic. It is a requirement to get a Degree of Science in Computer Science. Again, you can throw words around all you like, claim I'm 'spewing lies on these *very* comments', but no attempt at flowery language, nor any attempt at browbeating me will distract from the simple truths that I'm typing. 

>And next time, please keep everything to a single reply.

No. If I feel like replying twice, three times, or four times with different content that is my perogative and I will do so."
That is my understanding as well :)
">Ad-hominem. Curious choice. 

It is not an ad-hominem to point out that you are associated with the monero community, and thus your take may well be biased. 

> Yes, you replied to the counterpoints, you just didn't rebute them. See the difference?

First of all, 'rebute' is not a word. It is either 'rebut' or 'refute' but never 'rebute', ok? Secondly, it is not possible to provide 'definitive' rebuttals in 100% of cases, but the fact is I replied to every argument, and most of my replies have not been replied to. Therefore the onus is on THEM to reply to me, not vice-versa. "

"Nope. I'd rather have them accept LTC or Ethereum or Monero to be honest...
And its up to them what coin they accept, I mean, It really looks like they want bitcoin, but not Bcash...

Wich I understand 100%"
There are tonnes of better alternative right now, but the part about them being irrelevant is mostly based on their censorship (either that or uploaders just stopped using them), the fact that they kicked out all their moderators post-KAT, and the fact that their staff are now alt-left snowflakes. I don't think Ive even attempted visiting the pirate bay in the last 2-3 years, and every time I do stumble accross them again its impossible to find anything I actually want, and with mods gone its mostly malware anyways.
"Blockstream yes, I have a problem with that. I think the community should be condemning bank-funded contributions to the BTC code (if that's what you're referring to.)

I am very encouraged by what I understand of Lightning Network in its current vision for implementation. It gives incentive to keep fees low and will route transactions on the lowest fee route available. For off chain TXs to be open to a marketplace that encourages low fees doesn't present a centralization risk that I can see. So, at present, I'm good with lightning. "
oh yes I can't donate to a retard that doesn't want donations I'm so humiliated
One of the founders of TPB, Peter Sunde founded Njalla (domain registration) that accepts BCH. It's unclear how TPB got taken over by Corey's, but if any of you have domain needs, might as well support a BCH friendly service.
I'm not humiliated by them, nor the term bcash. I don't care at all. It's just money. It's like getting offended by calling dollars bucks.
"Ummmm why such a reasonable answer? We have to support our currency and bashing anyone that hates on it. No one is allowed to talk negative about it, remember?!?!?!?!

OOPS I THOUGHT WE WERE ON r/bitcoin"
">People won't be sending BTC with high fees so let them learn the hard way.

This is the greatest part about this whole debate.  It's not even a debate.   All we have to do is sit back and let Core do what it does best:  Nothing.  Scope creep (via over-complex solutions that nobody has signed off on or expressed interest in).  And denialism.  Nobody is attacking Bitcoin except Core.   It'll all play out on its own."
Well they take other coins so that won't be an issue. 
"Exactly. Pretty dumb if them. For donations you think they should take pretty much anything they are offered. 

But it's good, they'll piss people off, lose visitors and get less money. GENUIS!!!!"
They will just send ltc or ethereum if they want. Bcash isn’t even that fast in comparison, stop exaggerating 
"Isn't it really very coincidental that Julian Assange's twitter goes down after supporting BCH and piratebay trolls BCH?

TPB has been compromised since the day the founders were caught, and has been irrelevant for years in terms of uploader-support. All the major uploaders have moved to new and better sites, while the original founder all actively support BCH and promote on their new projects and businesses like Peter Sunde for example through Njalla
Tech savvy =/= Economics savvy
That's why 'they' do it. Reddit is so full of false narrative pushers and distraction nonsense there is essentially no message.
"i've been seeing a too many of these posts where trivial matters are blown out of proportion and pitchforks gathered. there's also anti-xmr sentiment making the rounds.


i'm starting to wonder if this is a new kind of astroturfing: pretend to be pro bch, exaggerate and blow trivial things out of proportion, make r/btc and bch supporters seem more toxic than they are. posts like these are in conflict with what i perceive as a friendly, inviting, critically thinking community.

"It's as if they don't like money. . . 

You pissing off a large and growing community of people who view their crypto as a ""spending coin"" and want to spend it online. Smart.

No surprise really - The Pirate Bay admins will add whatever you want if the price is right.
FBI doesn't like Bitcoin Cash. Not a huge surprise there.
thats fine it means they lose out on donations and people are free to donate somewhere else 
Oh, this is going to age well.

"I didn't realize the influence over torrent sites.

curiously so many sites are controlled by the fifth column?
great thing about free market is people can choose to do what they want and accept whatever they want as payment. none of you were going to donate anyways. ignore the gag and move on .
Pirate Bay are a bunch of jerks who don't respect property rights, anyway.
Why would they even bother to list it....
"Go ahead and send ""BCash"" to them anyway and see if they spend it."
"TIL people still use the Pirate Bay and haven't moved on to the hundreds of other better sites that have grown over the years and are better.

They might get an influx of donations for about a couple days to a week and then it will be nothing again."
The pirate bay is run by dumb Swedish communists. Who fucking cares? Don't give them any money

No body cares. And please stop posting posts like this, it is not good for bch.

They won’t add a BCH address because they are too scared of the Chinese government. 
It’s because Jihan controls the code base for Bitcoin Cash.  Pirate Bay is just scared of the Chinese government. 
$1 is cheap compared to lawyer fees.  I'm not going to shill for Monero because I don't need to.
Ok.  Buy whatever coin you like.  I'm advocating safe use, not collecting.  But ignoring fundamentals because you don't like fluffypony for some reason seems a bit short sighted.
and now they are purposely attacking a potential source of funds
What an idiot ? 
I find this quite shocking because the idea of cryptocurrencies is to have proper economic incentives and sound cryptography at which point you don't cate who is behind the coin
pretty ironic that this is no longer possible with bitcoin classic

"The conclusion of the white paper states that BCash is not bitcoin.

The entirety of BCH is a double spend rejected by the consensus that is BTC. So even if rules of bitcoin do change, it is by the white paper's blessing to do so as long as it is enforced by consensus, which BCH totally sidelined by starting its own.

I mean, if consensus doesn't mean anything to you, SQL is a lot more affordable."

Ohhhhh, shit just got real! I love you dude
The cryptocurrency mining was actually a great thing. It pisses me off that people pressured them into giving it up, because websites depending on other businesses is a far faaar bigger problem. Ads aren't just annoying, but promote censorship. Browser mining solves that.

"Exaggerating? LESS DONATIONS means what? it means exactly what it says... less donations. There is no amount or percentage or anything. You claiming they will just get more of other coins is based on what? Stupid idea that people who donate them these other coins would somehow want to donate them more just because they stopped taking Bitcoin Cash donations?

Get real... and stop using propaganda labels, it makes you a liar as propaganda = lying."
The same miners, including Wu are mining bitcoin legacy and bitcoin cash since they use the same machines and concentrate in the same geographic areas due to economics. That is a crazy argument.

"Ok, these were fair arguments. I feel I must apologize for naming you dumb at something previously.

>I suspect we'll leave it as is

Well, this is a good outcome, I suppose. With bulletproofs the fee should come down 82%, leaving as it is. Naturally, I believe cutting it even further would be better, even if just a little bit, but I was really worried on the opposite happening (fee per byte increasing). None of them happening, and Monero benefiting from bulletproofs alone would be good already.

I really want monero to succeed, and what happened to bitcoin is in my opinion traumatic. I will wait and see how things roll, helping as/if I can in any way besides donating. I will leave this scaling/fee debate alone until the fork.

Thanks for the reply and for everything you have done to Monero. Apologies for being harsh with you. Just want monero to succeed."
They bought into Core's propaganda and feel confident that BCH is where the centalization/bad-guys are found. Does make for an interesting case study when you have tech savvy types who can be suckered by nonsense to the point where they're mocking the side they've traditionally been positioned among. Fascinating.
"Yes, they do. You can see it in this thread. Any association between blockstream and xmr is basically poo-poo'ed away. Even though Fluffy's twitter profile is him with well-known blockstream troll Sampson Mow, and he's wearing a UASF hat, making the Dragon's Den 'D'. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. The monero community, like the BTC community, hopes you're too stupid to put 2 and 2 together, because when you don't have truth on your side, its best to lie lie lie. The bigger the lie you'll believe the better. So they're constantly 'exposing' themselves, to prevent you from doing it yourself, thus weakening your ability to do so in the future. Its the 8 mile defense (where Eminem's character used all his opponent's possible punchlines in his opening rap to prevent his opponent from doing so). 

Yeah, Fluffy is just 'good friends' with Core/Blockstream trolls. And AXA's partnership is 'not a big deal'. *rolls eyes*"

"> TPB changed hands repeatedly.

Opportunists.
technically its not stealing if its open source. There is no trademark or branding, by saying bitcoin is a brand, that by nature is centralizing what's supposed to be decentralized. Then it is no different than a bank trying to protect its assets.
Well, instead of just saying alright bud, try and defend your position. Why do you believe BCH is “ran” by Roger? Is he the sole miner, or is he the only one running nodes, or did he code the fork, what?
Bcash is settled every 25 minutes because no one is using their Blockchain so hashpower is pointed away from it
Using ad hominem is proof that you have no logical basis to support Bcash
I like the way you put that. Spot fucking on.
Which banks? out of curiosity. 
[They have the best devs](https://twitter.com/starkness/status/676599570898419712)
More accurately: it isn't a silver bullet
I read the whitepaper to describe peer to peer electronic cash with instantaneous settlement. I think BTC doesn't match, and isn't Bitcoin. Maybe call it LightningCoin?
Bitcoin doesn't have any dates on its road map.
"I'm running Bitcoin, and I can trust that. You'll keep talking about number of nodes as BTC's hashpower falls.

Ethereum is evidence of more transactions and more nodes. The opposite of Core's brainwashing."
"/u/Klutzkerfuffle - Can you tell us where you are seeing BCH at ""0.1 of bitcoin""?

A lot of us would *very much* like to know."
">BCH has the wrong philosophy. I don't trust the miners to tell me what is good for me. I don't want to jump out of the Fed frying pan and into the BCH fire. I like the slow, methodical, thoughtful approach of Bitcoin rather than the emotional appeals. BCH is DOA as soon as it gets some use.

But you trust the devs to know what's good for you? How do you feel about their decision to weigh you down with $37 transaction fees and lengthy transaction times?"
Why do you think BCH would be harmed by being used? That's what makes it stronger.
Don't forget the unknown cost of closing it in the future. And if you guess wrong, you open yourself up to fraud.
Yes any fork is the real Bitcoin if it works the best and gets the most usage. What you think we just want to fork once and then we're you? We believe in democracy. We believe in freedom. We're carrying the project forward.
That's because they are the financial institutions.
Why does this come off so culty...
"LOL of course you do...I made a comment that could be taken negatively towards BCH...

I'm genuinely curious why this sub is called BTC???"
Good luck with that kid, what happens tomorrow or there is another hard fork with less time in confirmation and bigger blocks? Is that the new bitcoin and bcash is no longer bitcoin? 
I understand the centralist censorship, even thou I have posted about increasing the block size and stuff in /r/bitcoin I have not got banned or post being removed but still I believe there might be a case. Im not stopping others to come here and talk about bitcoin, heck even talking about bcash is fine, the problem is that most of the leaders are trying to just steal the name of bitcoin, bitcoin and bcash they are both bitcoin, the real bitcoin is probably the one you support, but dont try to steal the name like normal bitcoin or segwit bitcoin is not bitcoin, it is
Alright bud
"To use BTC, you need to ""commit it to a lightning channel"" (make a bank deposit).

Bitcoin transactions are instantly settled, effectively."
You are such an obvious propaganda spreading asshole and you are an idiot.
Legacy bitcoin is now developed by banks and for banks. If you ever had any real interest in bitcoin, you ud see bitcoin cash is bitcoin and legacy bitcoin has been taken over by banks
^ useful idiot
"BTC be your own bank?

How come BTC be a replacement to bank with $20 tx fees?

Another one that talk about it but never used it.."
Even if that were true, your presentation leaves a lot to be desired. This is a failure to persuade.
"I can't see how it is ""gold"", unless real physical gold recently got a new properties where it's mass continuously increases to the point it can no longer be moved, and some of it also vanishes if it is moved."
BCH will most likely have both when the time comes. Also means it wont cost an arm and a leg to open a LN channel on BCH, unlike BTC if its blocks never scale up.
Lighting will never happen.
I like the one with devs and a logical, patient roadmap. This is a marathon, not a sprint. That's why I support and hodl BITCOIN. No alts.
"BCH has the wrong philosophy. I don't trust the miners to tell me what is good for me. I don't want to jump out of the Fed frying pan and into the BCH fire. I like the slow, methodical, thoughtful approach of Bitcoin rather than the emotional appeals. BCH is DOA as soon as it gets some use. 

Bitcoin is the revolution. Hodling gives it value. Coffee will be done on L2. BCH will need L2 too. They are much further behind and will run into problems that Bitcoin has already worked out. Either way, good luck and I hope we get our revolution one way or the other. "
Because BCH is the real Bitcoin.
"Lol keep telling yourself that. You can't see the forest for the trees. When it's time for y'all to come home, I hope you find a warm welcome and no ""told ya sos.""

If any cryptocurrency can survive, it will be Bitcoin. It is the most decentralized with real people around the world. How many BCH nodes are running in Ali Baba? And it's still 0.1 of bitcoin. How about y'all just try to keep the node ratio similar to the price ratio? Just kidding. That's impossible. You would have to have actual users and a smaller blockchain, neither of which will ever happen for BCH."
Yes any fork is the real Bitcoin you nail it, unfortunately for a lot of ppl in this sub and a bunch in /r/Bitcoin there is only one bitcoin, right now unfortunately for a lot of ppl there is more than one bitcoin, and trying to steal the name from bitcoin or bitcoin segwit/core whatever you want to name it is not right, we should be trying to push the technology forward and not fighting this stupid brand name war that Roger Ver has created 
">  I don't trust the miners to tell me what is good for me.

So you will trust centralized private corporate banking interests to do your thinking for you instead?"
"It’s unfortunate. I really want a well rounded debate. I really dislike the drive by insults without anything substantial to back it up.

Obviously a lot of people are threatened by the BCH movement."
Oh poor little BCH is getting picked on by BTC.  What a load of shit.  How does a blockchain 'treat' another blockchain?  Fucking weirdos on here ffs.

That's insane."
What are you talking about? BCH is Bitcoin. The only issue that's been exposed so far is that banks can try to keep people from updating MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, and it turns out that's only a temporary stumbling block.

Do you think this a good user-experience from a currency? From what it sounds like you're saying you should develop your own heuristic based on the state of the mempool and the transaction fees people are paying to determine whether you should even try to transact at all. BCH does not have this problem. At any time of the day you can get away with paying a fraction of a cent in transaction fees.
Wow is that r/bitcoin HQ?
"Absolutely not a good user experience. But a much better experience than a Bank of America savings account.

A good wallet can do everything I mentioned in the other comment. I feel like the high fees are a glimpse into the future, so economizing on blockspace is a good thing to get done now while it's still small time."
It sure would seem that way. I love this meme! Salt will find a way.
Yes, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It's back to the behavior of 2009-2017.
"Not necessarily, I just said no one owns the name. Not that it's right or wrong. Like ""Linux"" there are many iterations of the name that no one owns.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Bitcoin cash folks say it's the real bitcoin in usage, but not necessarily branding. Much like Linux has different flavors that cater to different usages, bitcoin is a protocol before it is a brand. The original protocol was changed."

"I have never paid a transaction fee like that. That is 100% the truth.

I have waited for the mempool, used Coinbase, Segwit, etc."
True. Except BCH's issues (whatever they are) would be exposed and that would be the end. If people are willing to deal with issues, there's Bitcoin. If people want no issues, then they can find a coin that no one is using. Where's the use case for BCH if it ever has any of the issues that Bitcoin has.

Yup, and the users just got a haircut for their fee market.   $100M is chump change for AXA, with over two trillion in holdings.   One of my family members worked for a top tier investment bank, they are ruthless and predatory.   They just took down a $100B market cap competitor to their banking and investment business, as well as taking retail off the roadmap for BTC entirely.   Most bitcoiners are intelligent people, most of those left are too invested to admit they were wrong, when basic TX fees hit $100 next time, we will see an exodus of biblical proportions.
BCH wouldn't be treating as anything if the groups here weren't trying to take the real Bitcoin branding all together. Leaders want BCH to be the real Bitcoin, this sub is even using btc but in reality it's a BCH sub

No wonder we never hear a peep out of Blockstream investors despite all the controversy.

Exactly, once Bitcoin became Bitcoin Core run by Blockstream, Bitcoin BTC became banker's controlled network that will never scale on Bitcoin layer.
I'm sticking with BCH because it's a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin was always supposed to be before it was changed to become a cryptogold instead.

You guys are jokers with your propaganda lol. thx for the downvotes. 
BTC never masqueraded as Wells Fargo or Chase though, stealing logos and web sites like bcash does. If you guys rebranded and established a unique identity I think you would gain credibility.

Serious question, if the block stream investors invested in some bitcoins then they could have got their investment back right? Is this some sort of fallacy or do investors not risk investing in something they are actively trying to sabotage? But they are betting on it to win never the less right?

that's buy signal then lolol
Wow thank you!
right on
Let's not make the same mistake with confirmation time and fungibility where other coins currently outperform Bitcoin Cash!
it's not fair
I like BCH, BTC is just a way to rape everyone with transaction fees. 
"Stop this dumbass wars. Bitcoin is bitcoin. It's the first, the biggest and mostly the entry point for all other cryptocurrencies. It's the only one that had to deal with massive scaling. The rest are just punkass newbs next to it.
But there were some decisions that were not best for its functionality. Bitcoin is a slow mammoth, it doesn't do things fast, but its making sure to do them right. 
Bitcoin cash made changes that were rash and superficial, but they work. For now. They will not work in the future. But they do work now. Bitcoin cash is way more usable now. Long term, probably it will lose a point to its existence. On top of that, bitcoin cash has the bitcoin name. Without it, it's nothing. It would fail, it wouldnt even get of the ground, because we already have many cryptocurrencies that are technologically superior and have existed for a longer time.
So whatever, use bitcoin cash, it works well in this moment of time, but don't bullshit yourself it's got some special power to take on a behemoth like bitcoin. It just has the name. "
Bcash will have to implement Lightning Network too at some point. This blocksize solution is the worse scaling solution for long term, it will never meet the scale of visa or world wide adoption. Doesn't matter if its fine for now, it doesn't even have the fraction of TX of Bitcoin...Bcash will have the same mempool problem if it ever reach some adoption.
So is this a BCH subreddit or a BTC subreddit? Because your name is BTC but you circle jerk to BCH constantly...
"dude its a fucking protocol.
you're confusing a bunch of kids fighting each other due to
invested emotions and ego for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not people, bitcoin is a protocol."
Transaction fees is what keeps BTC afloat. Without it, BCH would be consistently more profitable to mine. 
"Ty I appreciate it. r\bitcoin wanted to push me away. But r/btc welcomed me.

BCH isn’t “ran” by Roger Ver.
trolls, you are six hours late to the party, have you been sleeping?
That’s because bitcoin hodlers are their own bank. Bcash holders are shilling centralized shitcoins 
"BTC isn't ""cryptogold"". It's just a failed cryptocurrency (due to the strangulation of [Bitcoin Core](https://blockstream.com)). 

Fortunately we have Bitcoin Cash, a [P2P electronic cash system](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)."
"I prefer ""digital black hole"""
Premium pricing and shitty service.  It's like Comcast levels of service.
I like both coins and hold several others also. I think BCH and Bitcoin will both fulfill different markets and coexist without any issues. It will get interesting when we have large blocks (BCH) versus Lightning (BTC).
Nice.
Same here.
So you hate bitcoin? Why else you you dislike bitcoin cash, which is very much more bitcoin that legacy bitcoin.
Core/SegWit took the name. Big blocks and electronic cash was the currency I invested in so early. Not settlement layer. BCH represents the whitepaper, and is Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has/is becoming a bank tool... don't you see it?? Bch IS the Revolution.
"> But I hate almost all alts. I can't come up with one off the top of my head that's tolerable.

monero isnt that bad? but apart from that, BCH all the way
"
">I feel like the high fees are a glimpse into the future, so economizing on blockspace is a good thing to get done now while it's still small time.

The future of BTC with its irrational small-blocker dogma, yes. Other coins, no. You're buying into a Blockstream ad, not a protocol inevitability."
"this is exactly my point, BTC and BCH should be working together as solutions for unbanking the banks, yet the BCH leaders are way more busy by trying to stealing the name and brainwashing everyone about ""there is only one tru bitcoin"" ""bcash is the real bitcoin"" bs agenda. "
trolls, you are six hours late to the party, have you been sleeping?
How about you open your mind and understand that there are different approaches to life?
"> BCH does

It makes no sense. Open blockchain can't do anything. Neither BCH nor BTC. Some users act benevoent, some act malevolent. Miners just mine the most profitable chain or go bankrupt"

">Bcash will have to implement Lightning Network too at some point

Which it can do more easily than BTC because it doesn't cost $37 to open/close a channel

>This blocksize solution is the worse scaling solution for long term, it will never meet the scale of visa or world wide adoption.

Suppose for the sake of argument this dogma is true. Does it make more sense to cripple BTC while searching for a Visa scaling solution or does it make more sense to fix BTC's current problems with the quick blockscaling fix and then search for a better solution with the time that buys. [Here's a great analogy](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m26vv/the_pirate_bay_gets_it/drr5ta9/) by u/ChadMcChadiusDuChad posting on r/Bitcoin.

> Doesn't matter if its fine for now, it doesn't even have the fraction of TX of Bitcoin...Bcash will have the same mempool problem if it ever reach some adoption.

Demonstrably untrue with math. With 1 MB blocks BTC can support 7 TPS on its finest day. With BCH's 8MB blocks it can support 8x that. So it will take 8 times the amount of transactions that BTC is currently seeing before BCH hits its ceiling, and the code allows scaling to 32MB blocks without a hardfork, so BCH can do 32x the number of transactions that BTC can do."
We believe in bitcoin, which bitcoin? right now, BCh is ahead because they haven't shat on our dream.  $10+ fees weren't part of the plan, ever.
trolls, you are seven hours late to the party, have you been sleeping?
It's just a sub where people are free to say whatever they want so that means everyone here knows to support BCH. :P
"When people are allowed to speak freely, the majority opinion emerges. What you call circle jerking is the result of free speech.

I'm sure r/bitcoin die hard supporters cannot see the difference."
so go back to r/bitcoin where censorship keeps your nickers on. 
Ok. Good luck and good conversation
"I've been following this issue enough to see that Bitcoin has fallen away from its original design, and that is not something that builds confidence. I am not a fan of any fork activity beyond crucial security and maintenance of a standard or development on a predesignated blueprint. These things have happened and now we get to evaluate the aftermath. 

I think there are several types of criticisms about centralization that should be considered:

• One is the premise that Bitcoin Core is somehow more legitimate than Bitcoin Cash.

• Another supposes that Bitcoin Cash development is bad because it is alleged to be a centralized or insulated effort.

• A third would be that Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash are gaming the system to create advantages that certain users or types of users will prosper from at the expense of others.

To the first point, I do not accept that Bitcoin Core is more legitimate than Bitcoin Cash. There are several actions by the Bitcoin Core development that warranted branching away.

While speed of transaction verification is an issue, it is not an issue that I believe warrants any sort of modification to the client. One should be permitted to submit transactions without any fees whatsoever as long as they recognize that they will not have priority and may take longer. This is not a problem that should be solved by modifying the client. It is however a problem that can be solved by participating in an exchange.

The second issue folds back into the first issue, as you are not obliged to patronize any one fork over another. If anything, I hold a higher opinion of people who demonstrate a sense of stewardship in maintaining the integrity of their coin/branch. You ought to provide evidence to support your concerns.

To the third issue I invite everyone to present their concerns about changes that demonstrate bias.

I do in fact have concerns about Bitcoin Cash deviating from the design, but I have more concerns with Bitcoin Core doing the same. The lesser of two evils at the moment is Bitcoin Cash, IMO. My opinion can certainly change."
.50c! You could feed an army with that!
"What makes Bitcoin ""Bitcoin."" Is there a registered trademark that is owned by Bitcoin Core/Blockstream? You get to have Bitcoin be decentralized or you get to have an official centralized group of people who get to decide the trademark. You cannot have both."
trolls, you are six hours late to the party, have you been sleeping?
Because bch is bitcoin, lecagy bitcoin is not amymore
"r/btc exists as a refuge from centralist censorship. As a Bitcoiner, you shouldn't stop others from voluntary relationships.

Ticker names be damned, BCH is now Bitcoin."
