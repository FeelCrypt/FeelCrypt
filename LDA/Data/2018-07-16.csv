They didn’t fake chat logs they impersonated someone for some time and asked him if he wanted them to take someone out.   Watch the doc, it’s interesting.
Agreed, but the fact that all of the facts were not permitted in the case makes it strongly suspect.

Either that, or be very very careful in doing it.

"I don't want him to get clemency because we whined about it

A) that's not what he's accused of

B) even if it was that's a separate issue from clemency 

You seem to be missing the basic idea here. I don't give a shit about Ross, i don't want him to go to jail any more than i wanna help him. The point is it's not good for me or you for him to get clemency, and he has done nothing to deserve this sort of loyalty. Building market cap while making a profit isn't some public service

Do none of you cuck losers speak english? "
"It's not illegal...

Just makes it easy to say he's on his own"
Eh, that's not so much the problem. What really screwed him is when he associated his altoid account with both the Silk Road and his real identity. There were other mistakes he made that gave the authorities enough information to go after him.
What a shitty strawman. Unlike a King Pin, Ross was simply hosting the site, he was not sending out hit squads to kill people that do not pay, was not directly profiting en masse like a King Pin would, and certainly affiliated with 99.9999999% of the people that used his site. Comparing the two is...laughable. Do you also consider eBay to be responsible for every teddy bear sold with cocaine in it? Yeah, obviously not. Yes, he fucked up, by facilitating an ONLINE (meaning anyone in the world with access can use it) method for drugs, but it was the market and userbase that turned it into what it did. You can only blame the bank you bought your house from so much when a dog shits on your lawn. 
Doesn’t matter, he deserves it anyway because he conspired to have people assassinated. On the grounds of what he WAS convicted for, however, surely it does not elicit a double life sentence - especially since he didn’t actually do the trafficking, only facilitate it.
Not until the fbi showed up
You can't google search for everything that was on silk road so that's not particularly convincing. But assuming you are right, he should still be serving life in jail. The guy basically had his hand in the actions of thousands of separate criminal activities. 
"Yeah DEA agents who themselves were committing crimes who allegedly asked him to kill someone someone who doesn't actually exist, and who he didn't actually tried to kill.

The sources of the evidence that any of that happened at all are suspect.  For all we know it was DEA agents talking to themselves or other DEA agents there's no way to verify any of it which is probably why he wasn't charged with it."
Some people defend him. Most people are upset with the double standard that is prevalent well beyond him. In this thread it is easy to mistake the two, but I think if you take a survey you will find that for most people is definitely the latter, and that RU is just one of many examples.
"If Ross was trying to stay out of prison, that was terrible OpSec. Protip: Don’t run a drug site in the US - or even a country with easy extradition.

Then, don’t get caught with your laptop open and logged in to your drug site. Then they can rip through your entire digital life sourceside instead of wrestling with an encrypted drive. "

If you're going to piss powerful people off from Tor, don't leave any clues that point to your real identity, make sure you use internet from somewhere that's surveilled for timing attacks, and don't use vulnerable software."

I think you're confused about the purpose of money.
"Absolutely big pharma has a huge hand in it.  In the late 90s - early 2000s they spent over 15 Billion marketing it.  And what was their crime?  Popularizing it and making it readily available.  That's all Silk Road *continued* to do.  You aren't helping addicts not be addicts, or preventing the creation of new addicts, by making it easy for them to get drugs, and then explain it away because ""you might not get robbed/raped/poisoned"" in the process.

It's a case of ""I'm slightly less bad than the other guy, so therefore, I'm the good guy.""  Nope.  "
"True dat. 

Also, as a rule, don’t do things that piss powerful people off. "
