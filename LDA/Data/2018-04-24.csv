Ah, I see what you mean. There's a way to receive money on a channel where you were the only one to lock funds: you spend part of it first, that part moves to the other side and you can receive it back as payments.

Otherwise, if you want to be able to receive immediately, the other party has to  lock funds as well. Maybe they can collect extra fees for that, or some type of interest, I don't know. But it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve. 

>But there are going to be a huge number of nodes, most of which will be small, poorly connected leaf nodes.

Maybe not, since your fees go down if you're better connected because you have more routing choices.

Well, the current mainnet has 2000 nodes and seems to be working fine with the current algorithm. Improving it is not the priority for now, stability and security are much more important to get right first.

"0! + 1! = 2!

quick maths"
">Bcash is fully on board with the client server / master slave model 

I think it's appropriate to say decentralization is a scale and most BCH supporters believe there is plenty of room for larger blocks to provide sufficient decentralization.

That's using some generic terms to describe some unmeasured concepts.  Is ""decentralization"" a fixed number of nodes?  Does global location have any impact?  Do mining pools have much impact?  Is it a ratio of nodes / miners to userbase as measured by X?  What makes node count grow or decline - business incentive to run a node, an overall portion of the userbase, relationship to secure alternatives to full nodes (better SPV makes node count decrease?), bootstrap time vs ongoing costs, miners' needs to stay fully connected to the global mining network....  People fixate on blocksize without really talking much about all of the various tradeoffs.

People also try to polarize the argument by saying anyone that's not entirely satisfied with current constraints must be government plants, or Bitmain spies, or just plain stupid."
The issue with the current implementation you describe (bip37) is that it doesn’t scale well. Each time an spv client connects to a miner, the entire chain needs to be scanned from their last connection point to present. This is fixed with the above. In fact I just remembered there is a new protocol put forward called Neutrino. Check it out.

This is one area where I might well be missing something... 

My understanding is that when you open a channel to a peer, both you and the peer need to commit as much Bitcoin as you feel will be transacted over the lifetime of the channel. So if I want to sell stuff on EBay, I might expect to see a net positive of several thousand dollars or more over a year. But maybe not. I'm sure that hubs will be more than happy to accommodate buyers, where they can open a channel with little or no contribution on their part. But what business is going to be willing to tie up significant funds in a channel for me, on the off chance that I'll end up receiving a bunch of payments? 

As for the routing comment - I agree that most transaction paths will be quite short, probably 3 to 5 hops or so.  But there are going to be a huge number of nodes, most of which will be small, poorly connected leaf nodes. And even the specific channels between well connected hubs will be somewhat ephemeral. When I want to pay for my alpaca socks, is the solution to finding an adequate (never mind best) route scalable. There are models that might be applicable - TOR's onion routing and/or BGP.  But I haven't seen anyone claim that they have developed an algorithm that when tested in simulation allows the Lightning Network to function at thousands or tens of thousands of times of the current size. And I have heard people with much more network routing experience than myself express doubts. The routing problem is clearly difficult. But it must be solved, as LN depends being able to quickly and efficiently allow transactions to be directed through several unrelated nodes to the destination. "
Sinking?!
"> Stupid is wilful ignorance

perfectly describes btrash and its followers down 90% from its highs."
"> Probably with something similar to BGP routing. Occasionally a route will fail because of outdated capacity information but the user will only notice a small delay if a few more routes have to be attempted.

BGP only needs to reconverge when a routers peering status is changed. Summarised IP subnets are shared between neighbours and remain relatively static.

In Lightning Network, peers are learned via other peers and can change at any moment. This is how the LN decentralisation works. Channels are opened and closed between these peers dynamically upon each use. Each channel creation is essentially reconverging the routing table before a transaction can be sent. LN penetration right now is so minuscule, yet transactions are already failing due to routing issues caused by constant, massive reconvergence. 

BGP was designed to be statically connected to its peers without constant neighbour changes and with a relatively static routing table. Sure it receives new routes from those peers constantly, but it is not constantly dropping those peers and routes and looking for new ones. LN is. Without huge changes to the way LN decentralisation works, it can't scale like BGP. It would need to become a centralised layer. 

I'm by no means an LN expert, but I am a senior network engineer that has been working in the DC space for 15 years. LN is a completely different beast to traditional routing protocols that I just can't fathom a solution for; it just can't follow the same fundamentals without centralisation. "

Yes this ( https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/ ) detailed ananlysis does a great job of enumerated the virtues and downfalls of bloom filtering. The core bottleneck in all this is the serving of the spv clients. At 1gb the disk, cpu, and network speeds price out network participants that aren't well funded enterprises. But as I understand it Bcash is fully on board with the client server / master slave model where there are centralized datacenter miners and then everyone else. This obviously changes the trust model dramatically but it simplifies scaling concerns. 
"> Spv clients only need to download blocks they have txs in.

I could be wrong here, but I don't believe they even need that. They request a list of transactions relating to the addresses they own (plus some others they don't, for privacy masking reasons) and their peers provide them the transactions, and the block headers, which they can use to prove the transactions information they were given is correct. So even with 1GB blocks, SPV wallets wouldn't still only need to receive a very small amount of information to function."
I read the test net research proposal initiative a 3 or 4 years project plan with no guarantee of a successful outcome. Certainly no claims of  market ready product at the end. I think it's valuable research none the less but everyone seems to discuss it like a done deal. 
"I think you misunderstood the part where he shows he understands it thoroughly, or as well as it can be understood at this time.

You mean a path that consists of hundreds or thousands of nodes? I don't see why that would ever happen, six degrees of Kevin Bacon and all that, but the process would be similar to how it works with 4 nodes.

>What is it going to take to get a hub to commit to the *possibility* of sending me a few hundred dollars over the course of 6-12 months?

This was the best comment I’ve ever read. Thanks for that. I’m probably your only upvote
"Even a full 32MB block sustained is 1.6TB/yr (about $32/yr) and <0.5Mbps sustained download.

Does that sound like too much loading for you personally? Does that sound like excess loading if you add in safety factors for serving peers? Does that sound like loading that couldn't be supported by a sufficient portion of the network to allow for ""decentralization""?

Does that sound like capacity to allow for network growth? Even consuming BTC network capacity and then growing at historical BTC transaction rates it would be ~4 years of capacity. Does it actually prevent other network improvement activities (batching, Schnoor, other layer 2 efforts)? Does it prevent or depend on future hardware improvements?

Does growth in network userbase also allow for increased node operators?

What is sufficient ""decentralization""?

"The conclusion of the post is completely flawed, /u/MortuusBestia. The complete switch over by hash power is **extremely difficult**, if not outright impossible. Ironically, the reason for this are... fees. Yes, those hated high fees. Here's why.

There are two possibilities for a ""hash migration"". A ""slow"" migration and a ""fast"" migration. In the case of a slow migration, the network will adapt downwards, no problems at all. Just instead of ~2wks, it might be 15-17 days. In the case of a fast migration, though the situation gets more interesting, and we've seen some of that in November last year. What happens is that the txs backlog increases correspondingly fast. And what happens when the txs backlog increases? Fees increase! Which means that the corresponding block reward increases! Hence, miners will not be so keen to switch, especially because the price will never go to $0 immediately. (Unless there's a fundamental protocol flaw discovered, that is.)

Remember when Greg was ""popping champagne""? That's when the fees exceeded the block reward. For one or two blocks, the fees accounted for more than 12.5 BTC. It would happen again. Now assume parity of price - A miner has the option to mine Bitcoin with ~25 BTC reward OR BCH with, say, ~15BCH reward. What will they mine?

&nbsp;

This reason above is one of the fundamental reasons why I support small blocks AND a fee/blockspace market - Network security. Users are, at the end of the day, paying for the network security. Fees are insurance.

Hi there. Bloom commitment filters can help. Spv clients only need to download blocks they have txs in. They don’t need to store the result. Obv 1gb too big for that today, but once 5g is out 1gb will be a breeze. Also, it’s not strictly necessary unless absolute privacy is essential. Otherwise you can just ask the miner to look up your tx which can be indexed just like in chain explorers. And there’s a tonne of tricks to anonymise this process too. Job done.
"He is referring to the [Gigablock Testnet Initiative](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip065-gigablock-testnet-initiative.2610/)

I see prominent figures on the community continuing to use the term ""hard fork"" or ""forking"". How foolish.

It's not about how much is being used right now. It's about making the capacity available for usage down the road. It doesn't mean that on May 15 all of a sudden 32MB blocks will start being full. 
The new limit simplifies the code, as 8MB was a purely arbitrary limit.  32MB is (currently) a technical limit based on the serialization format.  So one benefit is simpler code.  Also, the other features in this upgrade (op-code restoration, etc) require a hard fork anyway, so there is literally no downside to removing the arbitrary 8MB limit at the same time.

Yes, but those splits would be the fork.  The main line being updated to the new version isn't the fork.  No one is going to fork this code, they are going to just update their current master branches to the new version."

Suggesting a rename of this sub is akin to a white man in the united states deciding to wear Black Face as a Halloween costume.  Regardless of his intentions... he'll find out pretty quickly that he's being offensive whether he knows it or not."
Yeah it's confusing and extremely unprofessional the way this sub is right now
Why, it's a Bitcoin sub. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Boom!
Wasn't it a bitcoin sub way before bch was formed? 
"> Technically miners could mine the ""old"" chain but that's not going to happen

Definitely not going to happen. Not like that's ever happened before.

"IMO the spike in price was due to positive reception of the upcoming fork.

So it might already be baked in. If everything goes smooth there will probably be another bump, but who knows."
"But bitcoin cash is not BTC.

But unfortunately subs can't be renamed. "

The client the SPV wallet is running on needs to be updated, but not the end user wallet as they just follow the SPV wallet. If you run a full node that has a wallet too then yes, you should update it. If you don't know, then I presume you're using an SPV wallet and don't have to worry about it. 
"> A fork is literally branching off into a new repo.

That is false. A fork is literally an implement with two or more prongs used for lifting food to the mouth or holding it when cutting.

When you use words, you should try to remember that they can have different meanings in different contexts. Fork in the context of a blockchain's consensus rules has a very specific definition. As does fork in the context of git source control, which is similar, but not identical, to fork in the context of other source control tools.

Failing to realize this makes you sound stupid."
This simply lays the ground work for the global adoption and mass-scaling for the future, [just as Satoshi envisioned](http://archive.is/L5yvP#selection-3429.0-3431.30).
"> What is next? 64mb blocks?

No limit ASAP to close the question"
It's an upgrade. It's a shame Blockstream/Core Devs [demonized hard forks](https://imgur.com/a/EXpbO). Also, to be fair, [hard forks are less coercive than soft forks](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html). 
Yeah, I mean of course they would be willing to put the welfare of others before their own selfish desires.
That is a nice feature. While I don't need that feature I am switching to Unlimited to improve diversity.
Do SPV wallets need to be upgraded this time as well like in the November fork? Perhaps not this time because last time there was a bigger change from EDA to DAA?
They want to save the world.. stop spreading lies
Might this cause another spike in The price?
When I see hardfork I think Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, what's the difference with this upgrade and does that change anything to the current BCH I currently own?

Oh, I mean it is definitely clear given their histories and philosophies.
"I really don't understand this upgrade. Blocks aren't nearly full. Shouldn't you guys be focusing on optimizing the code base instead of just increasing the block size?

I'm all for scaling with bigger blocks. But I feel that energy should be towards optimizing. Increasing block size when blocks start to get fuller. 

What is next? 64mb blocks?
"
I'm rather worried that these new opcodes are going to be exploitable in some way and the whole chain comes crashing down. Bitcoin Cash has been working fine without them so far, they add a lot more attack surface for questionable benefit.
"my nodes compatibility records:

    4/9: 1 in 20 (5%) on testnet, 3 of ~200 (1.5%) peers on mainnet 
    4/10: 11 of 61 (18%) on testnet, NB 1 of 61 is 0.17.0 8mb.
    4/16: 14 of 81 (17%) on testnet, 17 of 165 (10%) on mainnet    
    4/23: 24 of 109 (22%) on testnet, 22 of 150 (15%) on mainnet
    4/24: 25 of 113 (22%) on testnet, 28 of 156 (18%) on mainnet
"
Is it possible to continue mining the existing chain?
"From my full node, I'm seeing around 65% of nodes I'm connected to are running a version that's ready for the May 15th upgrade.

Comparing this to the Nov 15th upgrade: at the time of the upgrade, I saw that only about 70% of nodes were upgraded. It's funny, because according to the Blockstream/Core narrative, this should have been detrimental to the network. Instead, it wasn't an issue at all for the larger network. The nodes that weren't upgraded simply stopped receiving new blocks. The node operators eventually saw that their node wasn't operating normally, and upgraded it over the coming days. A week after the Nov 15th upgrade, most nodes on the network were upgraded (I still do see some non-upgraded nodes floating around though - I guess some people just forget they're running a full node?).

Bottom line: the network is in great shape for the coming upgrade. We don't need 100% of full-nodes to be upgraded, because almost all remaining nodes will upgrade soon afterward."
Ahh the real bitcoin cash...
In the previous years there was always a lot of focus on a balance of miners. It would be nice to also focus on a balance of clients so warning flags go up if any one client becomes too dominant.
I think it is better to refer to it as an upgrade than a fork lol, less people get their panties in a wad
Whats the point ? The blocks arent even 1/10 full. Explain the benefit pls
