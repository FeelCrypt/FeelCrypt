Don't be dogmatic. The white paper is not a holy book.
"It's the original vision for what Bitcoin should be. It's what people signed up for. It's what got thousands of us excited in the first few years.

This is exciting:

""A **purely peer-to-peer** version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."""
"Actually, the Lightning network requires that people use a middleman instead of using on-chain transactions. 

The first sentence in the Bitcoin whitepaper says a peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system.

Also, the Lightning network only scales micro-transactions and otherwise has the risk of locking up large amounts of Bitcoins.

Segwit is an optimization but doesn't even double the transaction level - that's not scaling.

Both of these are not the correct way to scale Bitcoin according to the whitepaper. Here you can read it again just to brush up: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
Low fee, high volume.
"There were always fees.

Nakamoto left the project. There's no reason people should second guess his wishes."
You have no ability to actually process thought. Its like watching a child trying to rationalize why he should get what he wants.
