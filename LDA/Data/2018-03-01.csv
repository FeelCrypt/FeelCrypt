"Awesome!
I just showed them support by loading my card again for the first time in 9 months, will go spend some today!
BCH PLS FTW"
The IRS's perspective is likely that each transaction counts as a taxable event.

anyone having any luck ordering with the bitcoin.com wallet? bitpay says its compatible but its not working :p
This defeats the whole purpose of BCH! Please ppl wake up....the day is coming quickly when more and more merchants adopt BCH. Be patient and DO NOT use this card. Protect yourselves from privacy concerns and the legacy financial banking system.
"because I'm free to use it how I like?

2 bits /u/tippr 

get fucked troll."
I'm sure plenty of folks are in it for the gains, and aren't interested in being told what their ideology should be. 
Definitely, I agree with you. But in the mean time, this is a good start and it increases adoption by using the currency along with telling people you are paying with this with a crypto, which spreads crypto to other people and increases adoption. End goal is when you dont need the card and just wallet to wallet.
That is because the EU is an overregulated socialdemocratic statist shit cesspool. Congrats to the UK for leaving, I envy them.
"You should move to the UK.  As long as you're not Slavic, brown skinned,  French or Asian, you'll be welcomed.  Just ignore the ""foreigners out"" chants, the bricks thrown through your windows, your food being spit on, and you'll be able to get a low paid job picking fruit on a farm for far less than that over regulated European minimum wage.  Living in your free market, unregulated paradise is just a cross channel train ride away.  Bring a jumper."
im working on disrupting it a little bit :)

US only
Cuz ur still using Visa for payments! I agree with u that it increases adoption and for the time being, yes this card is important. However, I hope that down the road, the adoption will be so great that we won’t need to use these cards anymore.
How? This increases adoption by using it and buying more BCH while you use it. We want people USING the currency, not just fucking hodling forever, whats the fucking point?
Yes you can
"u/sirnickyc, you've received `0.000002 BCH ($0.0025792 USD)`!

"only in the us :(
I would take one in Canada TOO!"
"If I recall correctly Bitpay is loaded and converted based on price at the time of loading. The only one I think I've seen that converts at time of purchase is Shift card by coinbase. But only available to murica.

But maybe someone can correct me."

*mic drop*"
no EU support as far as i can see... we are always late to the game..
I’d assume the transfer to the card is a taxable event. But the spending thereafter is not.
Then why do u own BCH then?
This is AWESOME! :) 
"So this is why the price spiked..
"
Where is Canada?
fuckin' sweeeeet
"Yay finally !!

Going to load up my bitpay card right now and buy something. "

"Does this card convert your BCH into dollars once when you load it? And then that amount of dollars is constant until you use the card?

Or does it stay loaded with a constant amount of BCH and, due to volatility, the amount of dollars you can spend varies?"
Charlie Lee's jaw just dropped to the floor
Buckle up, gentlemen! Calling $3500 and full BitPay support by end of March.
Finally low fees again!!!! I hate Bitcoin Core taking my money with fees.
Great, is it usable in UK? Any link to fee?

"US only, unfortunately. 

Is there any worldwide equivalent?"

"Can I withdraw it from atm? I never used bitpay
"
"Cool! For the BitPay card are all the transactions made on it taxable? 

For example if I load it with $1000 USD worth of BCH and I paid a smaller amount of the BCH, when I use it do I have to report all the transactions to the IRS for taxes or do these not count as taxable events and is used as a currency??? "
