No, IPFS. The metadata, links, hashes are on the Steem blockchain, but that metadata is an avenue for censorship if it was not decentralized.
What you said is irrelevant to everything. It's like being concerned that the team that got more yards should win over the team that scored more points. Clinton is aware that it's not popular vote and played a losing game.
"That's if you mean ""America"" in ""America felt differently than the MSM"" to me ""electoral vote"" not ""people of america"""
I don't know, but I'm not sure that's relevant to what I said. 
I've got a few I could probably throw up there.
Use micro payments for voting, is one step. 
Some marketeers suggest you should love your haters because they create excellent promotional opportunities. In this case perhaps this is the video that they tried to ban or didnt want you to see might give make in more interesting to a wider audience.
Oh that would absolutely work for botnets but the problem with youtube's moderation is that the bar is low enough that a determined group of people can report something frequently enough to get it taken down. I don't think that the issue with many removed videos is bots spamming so much as people being pricks.
The most experienced candidate ever forgot that its not popular vote?
We’re talking micropayments. Cheap for individuals, expensive for bot nets. Purely spam control. 
I am surprised Bitcoin miners havent't attacked and killed the Bitcoin Cash chain yet.  
You think that all other campaigns weren't playing the same game with even greater resources? Jeb Bush couldn't even hold a candle to Trump with over 100 million dollars, Clinton spent over a billion, and you think some Russian guys were the sole manipulators who tipped the scale with a bot net and a few hundred grand?
also viuly or LBRY are also working on it.
"On DTube the video links, hashes etc. are stored on the Steem blockchain, while the files are stored on IPFS. Storage on IPFS ensures the data is always available, but the metadata on the blockchain ensures that you will always know when it was posted, by what account and you always have available an index of videos uploaded to DTube.

On BitChute the central database can delete or reorganize the history of video storage, including who posted it and when etc. (although they can't delete the videos themselves). On DTube there is no central entity which can do that."
I tried it. Almost zero content so far. Literally 2 videos.

"Without Koolaid BCH would be extinct already!

It goes both ways, have you ever considered people dont want you to copypaste bitcoin?"
">The Lighting Network is unworkable, so what are they aiming for? 

To delay Bitcoin adoption as much as possible. To have two camps fight each other to death. (Cobracoin is a very clear example of this, have both camps talk about him and make spectators thing the only thing we ever do is fight the other camp). They go to /r/bitcoin and attack /r/btc. They go to /r/btc and attack /r/bitcoin. 

Everything to prevent Bitcoin adoption going exponential.  The tactics is one of the oldest in the books. First ""divide and conquer"", then ""divide and rule"".  Combined with ""[pressure from above and below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPd0Sg42Cvo)"". 

These are proven tactics and work in almost any domain.  Then there is also the blowing up of the market price (Tether). What ever group is attacking the concept of ""Bitcoin"" does not  see a threat in Bitcoin being a hyper investment or a speculative vehicle or simply a form of stock. 

It's the currency and the new money that will shake and undermine the current powers and when money becomes borderless it's the beginning of a wave of globalization  (because trade can now be done worldwide with a borderless currency) and  the blurring of nation states. Mega companies like Google are already kind of blurring this. All of this is the beginning of a one world currency.  However Satoshi was first and introduced a one world currency that nobody controls. (as long as we don't end up with one person having 99% of the coins)  

The only way to fight this is to get locally active, to turn it in to a movement. To show person by person, merchant by merchant the benefits it can have for them to start using crypto. This phase easily might take 20 years and still depends on the internet remaining free and open (a WWIII would probablly destroy the current internet) 

I don't necessarily need to see BCH go global and become the currency of the internet. Any crypto will do. I see every crypto that tries to be currency as Bitcoin. (that's why I don't mind Ethereum at all and don't believe in all the new technology we could put in BCH to make it more like Ethereum, like colored coins and stuff). But in the end by definition only one can become the global currency, not two. 

If Bitcoin adoption would take of at the same time as a big financial crisis ... well every time something like that happens it becomes harder and harder to stop this  technology from changing the internet and eventually changing the answer to the question: ""What is money?"". This also radically changes the way nation states are structured because tax is paid in the currency of the nation. Now a nation state needs to collect tax in the form of a global currency. That changes a lot of dynamics.  How do you fund wars when you can't control how much money you print? 

Big businesses and banks being forced to participate in crypto also have a problem because of the transparent nature of Bitcoin. For a big business to  receive payments on Bitcoin addresses it would be hard for them to avoid taxes since the blockchain is a open document. 

edit: To anybody wanting to learn more about this, just read Noam Chomsky his book ""manufacturing consent""

"Sorry I didn't specify 'they'.  I meant the Bcore people.  The Bcore people were trying to monopolize the word ""bitcoin"" so that they would be the only ones associated with it.  So that when someone new starts looking to buy ""Bitcoin"", the newcomer would go to the Bcore coin.

I also suspect they would get real salty if people started calling their coin Bcore."
"> on networking

That kind of makes sense for the basics though, I doubt the fundamentals of networking are brigaded and are probably accurate. Once you get into vendor specific things it might be more difficult. Assuming we aren't talking about social networking that is."
"It's so amazingly sad. Literally throwing mud and ""slurs"" (I don't care what they call it, BCash is fine by me to be honest) because that's all they've got. They are afraid of the inevitable Flippening.

Edit: Good points on keeping Bitcoin in the name."
"Bitcoin Cash is the name of the coin.  Cryptocurrency exchanges use ticker codes to identify coins (just like stock exchanges use stock tickers) and most cryptocurrency exchanges use the ticker BCH for Bitcoin Cash - so that's fine, too.

The term ""Bcash"" is a part of concerted campaign against Bitcoin Cash.  The goal appears to be to carry out some kind of forced rebranding of the coin by getting the industry and media to call it Bcash rather than Bitcoin Cash."

misinformation, I correct that for you. "
"Honestly the 'bcash' name argument is silly. Half of people think it's valid shorthand (instead of 'BCH'), and the other half think it's insulting.

"Well, bcore doesn't make sense because there are many other bitcoin implementations than just core... But call it that if you want, don't think anyone really cares.

that would be like calling bcash babc or something like that (as in bitcoin abc)"
"> because bcash is considered an insult for silly reasons

Personally I agree, I don't really care what anyone calls it. But you have to realize the history of this term.

[On the day of the fork /r/bitcoin tried very hard to make sure everyone would associate the name bcash with bitcoin cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6r05nm/megathread_on_august_1_2017_at_612pm_utc_block/)

If it's just a name and it's silly, why do you think core cares so much? It seems extremely clear to me that they feel the name bitcoin cash is a risk to them. This is why they employ useful idiots and an army of trolls to go around writing bcash everywhere. It's a big part of their plan apparently since they seem to focus on this aspect so heavily.

And you never take advice from your opponent. I will not call it bcash personally for that reason alone."
"This. Really I don't care who wins the bitcoin name ""war"" but I generally try to use BCH to clarify because it hurts people's feelings when you use bcash. I am a constant negative karma on r/BTC because I find it ridiculous to have a sub dedicated to hating the product it is named after but I'm just some faceless internet idiot. The only issue with calling bitcoin cash bch is that exchanges aren't uniformed in using that abbreviation. Binnance being one of the largest exchanges uses the tag BCC so from that perspective bcash is a clearer short name for the product. However until the but hurt resides over the name I will continue to use bch to try to facilitate some sort of civility in debates."
That's not how markup works.  
"The entire calling it BCash thing and playing like you guys own the brand ""bitcoin"".   Satoshi never intended to be owned.  It's entirely FOSS and trying to control the perception of it is just megalomania.  "

"That's the context of the OP yes... but this thread in particular is following up an accusation of reddit admins colluding with /r/Bitcoin mods

Nobody is ignoring the original context.  This branch of discussion is entirely different from the OP though.

That's what I thought too when I read the tweet. u/siabanana has delivered the smoking gun though. u/veryverysalty123456 got banned for stuff he said on rBitcoin.

"Now you understand how your original comment was perceived. That's the point I was trying to make.

I could not find a better way to describe your original post. You set up an entire series of loaded questions, then posed ""Who is being deceptive?"" as if that was a fair question to ask. It seemed to me that it was meant as a rhetorical question, the same way you accused me (correctly by the way) of delivering my message.

I genuinely apologize if my emotion got the best of me and cross over into disrespectful. I see where you're coming from and your point is valid. I try to approach online discourse as best I can, and may have crossed the line here.

I hope you see my over-arching point here, and there's more information on my other comments. I really don't like how anti /r/bitcoin this sub is as opposed to being pro-anything else. I've basically stopped participating because it seems like it's become a breeding ground for people who hate /r/bitcoin and want to talk about it... which was not what I was told when I first joined this sub at its inception."
"> Half of people think it's valid shorthand (instead of 'BCH'), and the other half think it's insulting.

Do the half that think it's valid actually use it or support it? That's what you need to ask. Because if the users aren't calling it that but the people who hate it are calling it something different there isn't much behind the claim that it's valid.

"Click into the tweet to see that it continues below the top-most post... with screenshots of the other comments /u/veryverysalty123456 made in /r/bitcoin (as in, the actual sub he was banned from) which got him banned there.

He wants to pretend he got banned for a conversation here and never made those comments in /r/bitcoin but he's lying. He just deleted them."
"Ok he lied about his not posting for 18 days. Which is a stupid thing to do. Though what rnorthkorea policy did his comment violate exactly? The timeline of it so far is:

1. He has an interaction with a rnorthkorea mod outside of rnorthkorea
2. He posts a comment in rnorthkorea that's hardly a bannable offense
3. He gets banned

Maybe mod just waited for him to comment anything so he can ban him?

If your mod logs where open you could prove that it wasn't this mod that banned him. And if you specified what somebody got banned for specifically, and which rule it violated, you could avoid any confusion on that part. As it is I find it perfectly understandable that OP made the obvious connection of having pissed of a rnorthkorea mod outside of rnorthkorea and then received a ban for that."
Remember digg died because they started allowing sponsored content to the top. This is essentially what reddit is doing but in a more clandestine way. It will bite them in the ass one day.
Surely r/Bitcoin will finally make mod logs public to verify this 
Am I? Last time I checked I'm just another user with no power to ban anyone or delete any posts other than my own. If other people want to discuss Bitcoin with /u/Anduckk here, then there's nothing I can do to stop them. I'm just posting my opinion here, and you're welcome to downvote it if you disagree 
"Calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"" sucks, as calling Bitcoin ""bcore"" does too."

"I think the past US election gave a textbook on how to divide a community. Same principles were applied. People talk more about the macro-level environments of each coin instead of the actual tech. It seems impossible to talk about the advantages of any crypto without someone trying to shit on someone or something in that community.

Now don't get me wrong, the hate for /r/bitcoin *is mostly justified*. Their moderation style is something that I don't agree with, and they clearly have an agenda. However, we don't really need to shit all over Bitcoin as well as /r/bitcoin. You can't take the worst of a community and hold it up as the example of the typical user. It doesn't work that way.

Honestly, in my crypto circle... we literally have no agenda. We can talk about any coin or tech, and the questions are more of a ""interesting... tell me more"", instead of ""shitcoin"" or defensive comments.

If /r/btc wants to be better... stop being so focused on /r/bitcoin. It's becoming like /r/buttcoin at this point where the only purpose is to try and troll/complain about another sub.

So why do people call Bitcoin Cash Bcash? No conspiracy, just two simple reasons: Bcash is more handy (shorter, easier to say & write) and to not confuse people that Bitcoin Cash would be Bitcoin.

2. ""Where do all these people come from who suddenly hate us? Must be paid shills.""

No. Bitcoin-Cobra owns the domain 
No idea.
"You asked about finding reasons why a post against LN is wrong. This is the opposite of criticizing it.

And it was an unimportant post with only 6 comments."
"> my problem is the fluff and nonsense, as opposed to educational and informational. 

This is Reddit. Lower your expectations."
"The submit button is right there ---->

Feel free to submit the content you think is interesting."
That's what the downvote button is for. If you don't like it, maybe Reddit isn't for you. 
I think that is just the nature of reality.   We all have to do our own editing.
"
>We have seen the community and coin torn apart by these people.

So emulating their actions and words is the correct path?

"
Yeah, when Theymos was getting hundreds of downvotes, that had to be vote manipulation, not hundreds of individuals disagreeing with his asinine comments /s
Gotcha, thanks!
"Looks like they co-own it actually. Who knows who has the authority with the registrar through, Cobra would have to de-anonymize himself to make a claim most likely if theymos were to take full control.

"Haha, I didn't say it was an ""important"" post, just a small counter example. And a failure of a discussion to find valid counter arguments is an answer to that question. I take a soft, humble approach when exploring criticisms of popular ideas on r:bitcoin, just like the approach I take here when criticizing popular ideas (or universally regarded truths) on this forum."
"I came here to learn more. 

Instead I sift through nonsense. "
Empathy is the first step to reconciliation.
TIL, thanks
I used unreddit a lot half a year ago and it showed very obviously the censorship of even polite and humble criticism of LN.
Stick around for a while, this subreddit is far from perfect but there's a lot to learn still. Plus, if you're interested in the views of the people from `/r/bitcoin` you can find many here as well
Indeed. And telling someone to shove a large object into a small orfice isn't going to help much.
Uncensored even!
Doesn’t theymos own bitcoin.org though (the domain)? He could always change where the domain is pointing and strip cobra of any power over it.
"> (they've already run out of any exchange they can recommend since Gemini said they'll support BCH, 

Same trend with banning people simply for ever having had posted on /r/btc/. They had to stop doing that. Still I don't think that went over Theymos' 90% threshold.

"
IIRC he also runs bitcointalk, which is a theymos cesspool.
this sub exist just to be a wailing wall for r/bitcoin complaints. and nothing else. bunch of crybabies in a containment chamber. sad.
unsurprisingly this comment is already censored over there
Sad.

What I want to know is why do they insist on using the r\/bitcoin name. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to switch to something like r\/deleted?
"Thanks for posting this! 

Had to come to r/btc to see that my post was removed."
Lmao
The only comments i ever see moderated are meta posts bitching about censorship.
that's actually pretty funny.
Removed by moderator.
"You know what /r/btc is in a nutshell?

1. Complaining about /r/Bitcoin blocking conversation

2. Complaining about Bitcoin being shitty

3. Hyping up Bitcoin cash with shit filler like ""look here's a picture of a car with the BCH logo on it!"" And ""look what I bought with BCH""

...

...20. Actual discussion on the benefits of cryptocurrency

...

...99. Discussion on the crypto markets


I'm done with the nonsense on this sub. 

Edit: Lol downvotes. Can't wait till I get banned and this comment gets removed, and the cycle begins here  "
Quit being so judgmental of other people! That makes you a bad person!
">/u/Bashco needs to take his mouse and stick it so far up his own ass, that the resulting mess should be censored 

Do you honestly think comments like this are constructive? "
comment already censored...
"u/cobra-bitcoin is ok with that, he can say whatever he wants and won't be banned because of theymos.

r/bitcoin is a full echo chamber."
"The sad thing about the manipulation in r/bitcoin is that they ramp the amount of censorship up and down according to their agenda.

This makes many people believe that they are not being manipulated.

(just learned here from r/btc that my post was removed)"
He'll be banned soon enough, it just takes more for some than others. I figure about the only reason they haven't banned him yet is because that'll turn him fully BCH, and seeing as he's controlling bitcoin.org they're probably trying to avoid that (they've already run out of any exchange they can recommend since Gemini said they'll support BCH, they don't want to lose a known website in favor of them too).
"I think the issue is, there are so many bad things happening in r/bitcoin so that pointing them out looks like hating but it's just objective analysis.

Other than that, I agree with you. We should focus on scaling Bitcoin and rising merchant adoption."
[deleted]
Denial of a thing doesn't make it better. We have to hold those who would censor us accountable. r/bitcoin is still the bigger sub, and newbies going there may never know of the history until they see posts like this on the front page.
Your post wasnt deleted! Wow!
You should have tried to say something slightly critical about LN a while ago.
"> Can't wait till I get banned and this comment gets removed

You won't, because that's not how this sub works"
"Downvotes doesn't mean you will get banned anytime. Other users just don't agree with your point of view.

I think people in this sub understand the importance of not censoring anything. If a comment that gets downvoted gets removed I assume / hope the community, including all the people who downvoted it, will instantly fight the censorship or create a new subreddit."
"Are you familiar with the history of this sub and why it was created? Educate yourself a bit and you will understand why we like to discuss /r/bitcoin.

>3.Hyping up Bitcoin cash with shit filler like ""look what I bought with BCH""

/r/bitcoin used to celebrate when people bought things with bitcoin too. It's sad to see the noobs don't understand that this is how crypto is going to thrive. Actual usage, not just buying and holding on an exchange.

>I'm done with the nonsense on this sub. 

See ya!"

That sounds judgmental.

/u/Bashco is fucking out of control
