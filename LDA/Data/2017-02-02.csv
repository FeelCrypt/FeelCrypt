"That's generous of you. I think Blockstream Core did more than just ""not call out the abhorrent censorship"". I think they orchestrated this WITH theymos, whilst pretending it was a coincidence."
Funny, I'm around almost every day and completely missed this survey. +1 for banned.
I agree, but in all fairness I must add that Roger Ver is a manipulative scumbag, too.
People are corruptable. Ironically this is the factor that Bitcoin is trying to solve.

Well that would explain a lot..

*(like the censorship directed at anything going against the interest of Blockstream)*"
Yes, they always contributed and collaborated. Without their collaboration it would never be possible that a single idiot is able to divide the community.

"I'm the first viewer! :)

Good video. Thanks for making it."
"this is an excellent video and review of the entire blocksize debate. 

you deserve to and should make an entire new thread on this.  "
Looking at the survey, I don't see theymos' full name listed anywhere. It's a shame the survey had such little responses to it too. 
"I actually held a survey on /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, asking ""Who do you think is most responsible for the schism in the Bitcoin community?"". Guess who came out on top in both surveys? 

Edit: Kinda depressing looking at [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6Yhg6CYp5PV1kYKlko3u-ES-zoBW-zb0S8fK5oaKyTE8pJA/viewanalytics) now. The irony is also that it didn't get a lot of responses because I got banned over it. As I didn't know that Theymos real name was forbidden to post (it was in the survey).  "
"""Nakamoto consensus only concerns the ordering of transactions."" - Core"
he could have preserved the  bitcoin's discussion forums decentralized nature. 
So say we all!
click the report button on a post and the moderator banns the user or deletes the post. there is underhanded cooperation here. 
It's very convenient to make theymos the single scapegoat. It was orchestrated and intentional.
Was his real name linked to his fake name? Or did it just mention his real name unrelated to anything?

Unfortunately this is what appears to have replaced Nakamoto consensus in recently years. "

"it's actually mind boggling how it's happened . 

of course , the fact the blockstream core and theymos have probably been in all along make all this far more comprehensible . and disgusting too ."
