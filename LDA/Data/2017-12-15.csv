More importantly crypto faith is already high and many people are already looking at other crypto for the currency case as opposed to store of value. I think Bitcoin will take a hit and XMR, ETH, BCH, and LTC will get some of Bitcoin's market share 
I'm out here saying, there's a lot of people who would make more of crypto literature than crypto investments. There's a lot of bright minds in this space 
Everyone would be effected because this coin is basically artificially propping up the price of all these coins. Therefore, you could see a market crash.  
Did you just say you're a libertarian and then go on to say you agree with the government taxing you for land you already own? You may want to know what libertarianism is before you throw the label around 
This is why I still watch Etherium. Litecoin and the likes tend to follow Bitcoins trends nearly exactly. Etherium seems to be on its own game most of the time. 
Stop straw manning libertarianism as a whole.  There are [11 different types of liberterians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx4wWGTttFI) and most are not as radical as everyone parrots.  Also even the most extreme libertarians would opt for a slow transition away from gov control.  Austin Peterson, the lead libertarian candidate, has called for a 1% across the board cut if elected. Does that sound like anarchy to you?

"Coinbase is important, not because you use them directly, but because their actions would send very clear signals when paired with BitPays decision to support bitcoin cash before anything else.

After Coinbase adds full trading support, there is no going back; we will be on even footing or even surpass BTC in terms of adoption and the market will react accordingly."

I totally agree with you. But my point was that Andreas has now joined the other side for better or worse. I've met him before and he is ostensibly a good guy and every speech he delivers I learn something. But as an ex auditor and regulator his last couple of speeches had way too many red flags. Right now, Bitcoin needs a Steve jobs and the core devs collectively have <zero charisma. If tomorrow they all disappeared, no one would care and Bitcoin would benefit tremendously.

In theirs transactions never expire? Why is it so bigger? I've noticed the difference in pending fees is dramatic.
Well yes, demand for transactions on the blockchain are increasing so people are forced to pay higher and higher fees to get their transactions through sooner rather than later.

As I was learning about this situation, I also briefly tried to stay neutral. That's natural to want to do, why would you want to take a side and make people hate you. I'm not one to believe conspiracy theories without evidence. But then I kept encountering evidence. It's one of the strangest experiences I've ever had, on par with discovering crypto in the first place. It's really a fucked up situation with no neutral position.
Your argument is so stupid it's not worth arguing with you. Good luck with your life.
Lately a lot of them buy some LTC because they want to have whole coins, and then next some total trash shitcoin because they can't tell it's indistinguishable. IDK what that proves.

It looks a lot like a sawtooth pattern because most blocks clear the mempool."
"Every 10 minutes a new block is added to the blockchain. This new block contains a certain number of new transactions (this is how new transactions get **confirmed**).

The graph represents the number of **unconfirmed** transactions that need to be confirmed (also called mempool). Because of the block size limit, they can't all be confirmed at the same time.

If we double the block size, we would double the amount of transactions that can be included in each new block, and eventually it would lower the amount of unconfirmed transactions because of the increased confirmation rate, thereby changing that graph."

You're correct. Blockchain.info's mempool is much bigger.
So in other words bitcoin transactions are increasingly valuable to people? 
But not the one it deserves.
Doge had a completely full memepool back in the day, but ppl got bored with doge memes.
It just seems weird to me, that crypto people arent more united. Im actually really looking forward to when, in the future, some more light be shed on what happened between the involved.

No. It just means its not scaling to current popularity. If I make my own crypto, memepool would be 0. Wanna buy it?
New users are not trying to use it as a currency.  Now that may not have been in line the original white paper, but I doubt Satoshi was expecting this rate of adoption. Columbus wasn't looking for America either but that worked out pretty well. Put yourself in the average person buying crypto in the second half of 2017, what do you think they are going to buy? This sub is a giant echo chamber.
‘Tis a source of some pride. 
By Bitcoin do you mean BCH?
Thanks! /u/tippr $0.50
Perhaps the down voter thought I was saying that the mempool was irrelevant - I wasn't too clear!
Any way to explain to the simpler minds how increasing the blocksize would affect this graph? I keep reading comments that suggest increasing to 2M
How do I claim it ? The other day someone tipped me but I couldn't get it into my BCH wallet
"Thanks, that's pretty much what I thought. And why don't people want this? Less transaction fees for miners? More work to confirm each block? 

Also, who would/could make this decision to increase block size? "
With a majority of hashpower? No. They can go back to genesis if they want. Some wallets will refuse to rollback more than a few thousand blocks but that's not an SPV vs. Full node distinction as much as a design decision (you don't have to store unlimited rollback information if you just assume the chain will never drop more than X blocks).
[deleted]
"Full nodes don't give you much extra security. They protect you against a miner-majority doing one specific attack (mining invalid blocks). They don't protect you against a miner-majority doing another specific attack (chain rewriting).

Both attacks involve making you think you were paid when you actually weren't.

It seems weird to think that miners with majority hashpower would use the SPV-only attack when an attack that works against SPV and full nodes exists and is fundamentally unblockable."
"Theres multiple default configs. Depending on the code version you run they're completely different. 

Here's what the current defaults are, using the latest bitcoin core code:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin

* -maxmempool=<n>	Keep the transaction memory pool below <n> megabytes (default: 300)
* -mempoolexpiry=<n>	Do not keep transactions in the mempool longer than <n> hours (default: 336)"
[deleted]
Dude, I'm just asking which one is closer to default config...
Having $10 transaction fees for no practical reason is a bug, not a niche.
"Well there's no easy way to translate the state of multiple mempools together into one graph, unless your bar plotting would also take into account transaction age as well as transaction spread (how many nodes have a given tx).

This would require a 3D graph, in addition to non-uniform bars (like a heatmap on every bar). Certainly doable, just not immediately obvious to conceptualize."
"rBtc used to be the little guy, and it's very easy to blame and bully the victim. If everyone does it, surely it's right?

Personally for me - it's censorship that ruined anything that does it with Bitcoin. There is little to fear from cowards who hide behind censorship and refuse to participate in debates, because they lose them.

Ministry of truth exists for a reason."
"> It reduces people's ability to run full nodes. Full nodes need to download, verify and rebroadcast each block as it is confirmed, so increasing the blocksize increases the data they have to download and upload.

It seems to me that what drives the requirements is total amount of transactions submitted, not block size.  Nodes have to send and receive the transactions anyway, *and* they have to validate them before sending them.  This work is independent of block size; after all, smaller blocksizes simply integrate the transactions out over more blocks.

Furthermore, afaik, there is work in progress to reduce block transmission i/o because nodes generally already have the transaction data.  So again, it seems as though the total number of transactions submitted is what primarily drives the bandwidth, compute, and RAM requirements of full-nodes, not blocksize.

If my analysis is wrong, I'd certainly like to be corrected; I'm trying to look up some hard data about how much work and bandwidth are used by node transaction vs block data, but haven't yet found anything conclusive."
Since you sound very fair to both sides, can you tell me why critics of the current status quo are unwilling to simply adapt and use bitcoin for large purchases (car, house, exercise bike) and use LTC/BCH for small purchases? If you look at market analysis, it seems that market signaling (high price) favors multi-tier system with different cryptocurrencies having different niches.

"It's not about miner fee nor miner work. There are systemic consequences that Core developers don't like.

It reduces people's ability to run full nodes. Full nodes need to download, verify and rebroadcast each block as it is confirmed, so increasing the blocksize increases the data they have to download and upload. A lot of people already can't run good full nodes because of monthly bandwidth limits.

This has several implications

1- Full nodes are more resistant to a majority miner attack on the network than lightweight SPV wallets (like the one you probably use) because SPV wallets verify and download very little data so they don't know if the blockchain they are following is valid, they just blindly follow whatever blockchain has the most proof of work (miner support). The counterpoint here is that miners have incentives to not hurt the network and it would require a lot of miners to be able to perform such a majority attack, so people dismiss the risk.

2- Full nodes are also necessary for the lightning network to successfully work. If running a full node is very cheap we could have tons of LN routing nodes and that would allow a decentralized effective LN. LN is supposed to allow instant, near-0 fee transactions.

No one can single-handedly update the blocksize on our network. It would require a near unanimous consensus of all users for this to happen without a hard fork (the network splitting into 2 blockchains). 

On the other hand, anyone can update the blocksize by doing a hardfork, which has already happened and is called Bitcoin Cash. If you want to support that hardfork you can move part of your assets there. If a strong majority of users moves to bitcoin cash that will in all practic terms become bitcoin. "

Nodes individually each decide whether they keep a transaction or not. That's why its a setting and not a set value. Some nodes keep transactions forever, some drop them after 3 weeks. Some use a 300MB mempool, some use zero.
"Actually a lot of people realize that bitcoin has problems, but many of them are these two:

In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

Empty memepool doesn't make a cryptocurrency valuable? Hmm, you know what? You just might be right! DOGE is a legendary meme of a cryptocurrency and always empties its memepool, yet it's worth only about 20 satoshi! :P
I understand what you mean. The coin is so popular the transactions are literally backing up because people are actually using it. I don't see any memes of bch and its 150 transactions per block, the other day I saw a block with 98 transactions in it. So post your memes and enjoy your delusional vision.
">An empty memepool does not a valuable crypto make

Huh? I think I somewhat understand what you are trying to say. You realize those are stuck transactions? You don't think stuck transactions make a crypto less valuable? "

"This is a graph of the mempool, which is the pool of transactions awaiting inclusion into a block. Different colors are different tiers of transaction fee in satoshi/byte. The chart is showing that the number of unconfirmed transactions continue to climb because the overalll ‘height’ of the graph is climbing. It also shows that fees continue to rise as well, since new colors bands appear on occasion.

And to continue the explanation. There is a colorful fruit candy in the USA called Skittles, who’s tagline is “Taste the Rainbow”. The commercials are typically strange and the impression of the tagline is more along the lines of, “Be Amazed”. This sentiment is likely shared by those who see this chart."

"No, what I am saying is that transactions over $1.00 can be easily handled on chain, and that transactions under $1.00 can be handled with simple protocols involving no complicated smart transactions, just small scale trusted aggregators.  There is to little at risk to justify complex klugery, such as LN for these cases.  Now it may be the case that I've drawn the line too high, and people might want a ""trustless"" system for transactions in a narrow range, e.g. less than $1.00 but more than $0.10.  Perhaps there is a market for a LN network in this region, but this is hardly significant and certainly no excuse to sabotage on-chain scaling to force people into LN type solutions."
my breadwallet - how do I go about opening a wallet on the bitcoin cash side with that money in it? This feels like im moving houses & trying to keep my telephone number haha 
I never said it can't scale to 5mb.  I said it can't scale to all transactions on chain for all people.
Yea see that makes me think them killing btc might plausibly be intentional. They are salty they didn't get in early so they might wanna crash everything and load up on cheap coins. Idk that's my conspiracy theory of the day.
"A valid test (but only one such sample) would involve two separate purported test users, one who is a merchant who creates an invoice and one who as a consumer who pays the invoice.  Unless you, personally have done both parts of the transaction you know nothing about whether the system worked (for you).  This is equivalent to the early tests many of us made with Bitcoin where we had two wallets and we sent funds from one to the other.

Of course, such tests won't show whether the system works at scale, nor will they show whether the system can be trusted to hold your funds.  But they are the minimal tests needed to see of a system, whether BTC or LN, is even functional.

Were you were to do this with BTC you would discover that your funds would get transferred, even  if the ""merchant"" and the ""consumer"" were not on line simultaneously.  (Again, this is one of the tests I made back in the early days.)  If you were to do this with LN you would discover that the system did not work.  (Here you would have to deliberately ensure that your test consumer and your test merchant were not both on-line simultaneously, otherwise you might get a false ""success"" for an ultimately unviable system.)

Or you could just take many days figuring out the LN white paper and conclude that the system is way too complex to every possibly work in the real world, even if the people designing it happened to be true geniuses.  "
You actually don't verify anything except your own transactions.  And mine are verified after an hour so its just a huge waste of electricity and it bogs down the network.

You could say that and make it seem like I'm some indecisive flake, or you could say that I just changed my mind the more knowledgeable I became  
"> My biggest concern about Bitcoin Cash is this: there are tons of altcoins out there, most of them have some selling points, they can do certain things a lot better than what Bitcoin can. Rather than creating yet another altcoin (it does not have the network effect, it does not have the market cap, it does not have the most proof of work - hence it cannot be something better than an altcoin), why not promote one of the best altcoins as ""Bitcoin 2.0""?

Because it's Bitcoin.  It's the original.  Just because a software+network fork happened, doesn't mean it doesn't still have the same history and original utility that Bitcoin had.  Bitcoin will always be the first, and the only way to save it, if you will, was to fork it.

Me personally, I moved to something else, but I understand why people would want to keep Bitcoin alive.  Hell, I hope Bitcoin Cash takes over and can eventually have the name back.  It's history, the original, the one we all built off of."

"> Obviously, you've never attempted to run a computer system at its limits and deal with the bottlenecks and limitations involved. I have. I can tell you that, if you know what you are doing, you can quantize the amount of computation required to meet a given level of user perceived performance (eg. transactions per second) and you can then engineer the hardware and software to achieve the desired result.

"What that means is that either side can screw you out of the fees you spent funding the channel and the fees that you pay when your ""honest"" counter-party closes the channel.  Quite apart from opportunity costs and the ""time value of money"" it is clear that opening a channel to a sketchy partner is not going to be risk free.  This is such a significant factor with BTC fees that it precludes any rational person opening a LN channel to an anonymous hub.  As a result, some system of authentication of hubs will be required or will have to evolve.  And any system of authentication is inherently centralized, because there is a central authority that authenticates the players.  And once this has been done, then the next step is government monitoring and regulation.

For this reason, there is no chance a decentralized LN will work to solve any real-world scaling problem.  

The unique aspect of Bitcoin is that it does not require any authentication of the nodes or any of the users.  This, and only this, is what makes Bitcoin decentralized.  This comes at a price which is two fold:  energy has to be burnt to perform proof of work and nodes need to do work to validate all of the transactions.  Any design in which some nodes validate some transactions (LN is just one of many such) will require a way of ensuring that the players are segregated and doing their job, namely validating the transactions they are responsible for validating.  This will inevitably involve a system of authentication, such as a reputation system. Any such system requires a central authority who authenticates the players, otherwise the system will be subject to Sybil attacks.

I've eliminated a lot of arcane technical details which people who understand the difference between Leslie Lamport's solution to the Byzantine General's problem and Satoshi Nakamoto's solution of a related, but harder problem, the anonymous Byzantine General's problem, will appreciate.  Unfortunately it's not something easily explained to people who haven't studied the theory and practice of distributed systems protocols. "
"You are thinking of a multi-sig address. LN uses them, but is much more than that.

As an LN user, you create and fund a payment channel with anyone else on LN.  You are now connected to everyone on LN. This costs a few cents to a fee dollars. It can be done at any time.

When you buy your coffee, your transaction  is instant (no waiting for confirmation), private (sent with Tor-like onion routing), cheap (nearly free), and trustless."

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.

edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

You are almost certainly one of a few things: 1. A misinformed user, 2. A Core enthusiast and thus,  are simply trolling here in r/btc, or 3. Dragon's Den Troll.

Regardless, you're wrong. Bitcoin Cash has the exact same fundamentals that Bitcoin has always had for 9 years. If it's true of Bitcoin Cash, it's true of Bitcoin Core up until it lost its way with  the 'Don't Spedn' culture.

Bitcoin can and will replace fiat, as Bitcoin Cash."

"Obviously, you've never attempted to run a computer system at its limits and deal with the bottlenecks and limitations involved.  I have.  I can tell you that, if you know what you are doing, you can quantize the amount of computation required to meet a given level of user perceived performance (eg. transactions per second) and you can then engineer the hardware and software to achieve the desired result.  This is the kind of work that computer engineers do who work for companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.  And on a smaller scale other people do the same thing.  

Do not confuse ""computer science"" with ""computer engineering"".   There is a huge difference between these two, as it relates to people who deal in ""basic computer science"".  If you get sufficiently advanced in computer science you get grounded in mathematics and if you get sufficiently advanced in computer engineering you get grounded in electrical engineering, then physics and ultimately grounded in mathematics.  But this is not the level your post addresses.

"I will quote on this: 


""You're absolutely right that many contributors to Bitcoin Core (and the wider Bitcoin development community) aren't the best communicators. This is a problem, and needs improving. Blog posts (something I dread writing...) are one way.
But Core is not a formal organization. It's a loose group of people who collaborate on a software project. The correct response, on my opinion, isn't to appoint a spokesperson. Nobody really can speak on behalf of everyone involved, and I don't think that's needed either. There are plenty of other ways to communicate."" - Dr. Pieter Wuille"
"I understand your point. It’s a band aid that fixes the problem now until a solution can be put in place. 2mb has already been accepted by core in the past. 
Bitcoin Cash won’t have this problem, as there is no block limit. "
This makes me sad if true. Why the corruption :(. Wasn't massive worldwide adoption enough?
"But you haven't stated any facts for your decisions only feelings, a bit flakey to me.

"
"Not really.  They fixed third party malleability.  However, they do not have a fix to 2nd party malleability, which requires that the TXID of unsigned transactions be fixed in advance, so that transactions can be signed (not broadcast) to spend the transactions that have yet to be signed.  (If you don't understand this, just note that LN is complicated and this is just the simplest part of its Rube Goldberg design.  It gets worse once the channel has been opened...  And still worse when channels get concatenated by as yet unscalable routing...)
"
How do I know that those transactions happened? Do I just trust you? That is, if I'm syncing for the first time
Why is it on bitcoin's core best interest to keep block size to 1mb? They know that it is going to die sooner or later. Why aren't they doing something?
"> No, what I am saying is that transactions over $1.00 can be easily handled on chain, and that transactions under $1.00 can be handled with simple protocols involving no complicated smart transactions, just small scale trusted aggregators. There is to little at risk to justify complex klugery, such as LN for these cases. Now it may be the case that I've drawn the line too high, and people might want a ""trustless"" system for transactions in a narrow range, e.g. less than $1.00 but more than $0.10. Perhaps there is a market for a LN network in this region, but this is hardly significant and certainly no excuse to sabotage on-chain scaling to force people into LN type solutions.

I can't send a transaction today without paying $10-$20 in fees. Good luck arguing a use case for sending $1 for $21.

I am not arguing for LN. I do not know why you are arguing with me about it. I am arguing IOTA. I am saying Bitcoin Cash can scale for humans, but not for machines. IOTA is only one that can do both."
Are you kidding? bcash is more centralized because of the 8 mb. Do you know of anyone running a bcash node? What do you think would happen if you remove bitcoin.com and Roger Ver dies. Blockchain does not own bitcoin, it only employs 10 developers out of almost 300 hundred. If bitcoin would be owned, by blockstream,  you would have blockstream spokeperson speaking about it - kinda like Roger Ver is going all over the world campaigning for it.
I agree with everything that you say, but why isn't bitcoin saying that. Why isn't bitcoin fighting back? 
well, you want to keep the LN gift card in case the other parties you paid to lose their LN gift cards and then you get all their monies!
"This must be the biggest misinformartion many Bitcoin supporters have of these coins. Bitcoin is the bankers coin, LN will move the profits from miners to bankers. Bitcoin core is the centralized version of Bitcoin. Where as Bitcoin cash still is the original peer to peer electronic cash, Satoshi meant it to be.

Bitcoin cash is the revolution that put's power back to people. That's why people support it. It has no ceo and several developer teams, unlike Bitcoin core, which is developed by one single company."
"yeah, I paid $20 to transfer $100 between exchanges.

[Regarding what makes bitcoin decentralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dp5cn/point_2_decentralization_what_is_it_why_we_have/)


>Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. 
"
This, my friend, is called projecting.  XMR and BTC supporters are not the ones that fill these topics with subjective BS about their favorite coin.
I think it’s reasonable to assume that if there is an emergency situation, the devs will pull out the code planned for such events and miners will help make it happen. 
"Try PayPal, fees are cheaper, must be better

"
"Its still very important.

Miners can still decide what is most important for them in the long-term, and that May be to kill the BTC chain.

We're in the same position we've always been.  Nothing has changed."
"Just by that main difference you can spot clear centralization on bcash.  
Take out bcash CEO, salesman or lead dev and you would see bcash collapsing to the ground.   
It would only take Roger Ver to say ""I quit"" to see bcash collapse.  
That's why I see no future on it. 
The only power they are gaining and still keeping them floating is all the propaganda they do trying to steer newcomers away from bitcoin.   
Bitcoin doesn't need that."
"you know bad shit is about to happen when you agree with people who hold various libertarian viewpoints.

I agreed with them when they proclaimed that BTC and other cryptos are going to be the future, and now scratch my head as they slowly start to show their true colors. (which is contempt for the poor and those people who aren't as rich as them)"

"Not only do you have to lock up funds, but the merchant does, too.  Hoping for a payment in this new payment method.  And every hub between you and the merchant have to also lock up funds.

If you want to fund a $25 payment channel to a merchant, you and your LN hub (Hub-A) both commit $25 to open the channel.  If your Hub-A does not already have a relationship with the merchant, Hub-A has to open a $25 payment channel (both sides committing funds) to merchant's hub (Hub-B).  And the merchant must also have committed funds to Hub-B of at least $25.  There can be many additional hubs... but this is the simplest (ha) way LN will work.

*Everyone* has funds tied up that they can't use for other purposes.  There is a time limit on the channel, and even if you need immediate access to your unused funds, it can take at least a day for your hub to agree to close the channel with an on-chain transaction.

And, each hub will charge a fee along your path, since they had to commit funds for your benefit.  Efficiency at it's worst.

And (it gets worse?) you and the merchant and the hubs have to constantly have an online computer watching the channel.  OR you can pay someone (probably HubA) to do it for you (where's the trust in this?)."

>No longer is the price per transaction determined by the free market, but instead by a hard-coded limit that intervenes in the market."
"Here is a really unpopular opinion among both sides: 

I believe the first layer needs to be the fastest, most open layer. 

If anything the LN type network should be the first layer not the second. The second layer if it needed one would be the slower highly secure network that deals with high valued transactions. (pay extra for added security)


And here is another really unpopular one: I don't think bitcoin even needs a blockchain that keeps track of every transaction. Once it reaches a certain number of confirmations the history of that transaction  could be discarded. Bitcoin really only needs to keep track of validated and confirmed current balances. If the network was secure when it validated and confirmed those transactions that should be the end of it.  Because what is the point in trusting any number of confirmations once it is added to a block? 

 But it is what it is. "
"Are you intentionally lying? Lighting network has nothing to do with side chains.

[The patent is a **defensive patent** and has been praised by the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/blockstream-commits-patent-nonaggression)

The [lightning network concept](http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) was not created by the same group that [created sidechains](https://blockstream.com/technology/sidechains.pdf).

This is just all incorrect. Please try to verify what you're saying, you're in an echo chamber here, so actual facts don't fare well."
What are you talking about? Lightning network is not a side-chain. Think of how VISA scales. They have so many gateway providers that take the authorizing/processing request. When you swipe a card it does not touch VISAs database directly. The only thing different is it takes significant effort to become a payment gateway provider. With lightning network almost anyone with little technical knowledge can run a lightning node and get paid in very small amounts (less than a penny) which adds up to a lot when you allow thousands to millions of transactions to process thru your node. Any on-chain solution is like kicking can down the road, at some you hit a block size limit and you cannot continue to fork and increase blocksize all the time.
"haha, yeah it's kind of a hassle.  I have some bitcoin on paper wallets that now have BCH too and it's kind of weird.

"The largest 100 mining pools could (if they switched to BCH) could be running Visa scale transaction rates in a few months.  The present software handles perhaps 1000 transactions per second and there are various simple tweaks that can speed this up.  My six year old desktop computer that cost me $600 can already handle 1000 transaction per second.   Of course there is no chance the transaction rates will grow this quickly, so there will be much more time to solve any programming glitches that arrive.  There are multiple teams developing BCH software and if one of them gets mired down in politics they will be simply bypassed.

Bitcoin scaling is a **very** simple problem to solve.  It's actually easier to solve than the scaling that Visa has done, due to the extreme simplicity and robustness of the design.  However, scaling Rube Goldberg designs such as LN are another matter, entirely.

"Watch this [presentation on the results from the first tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJm2ep3X_M) of 1G blocks.  

They present data showing the scaling capabilities and pitfalls discovered so far.  This is just the beginning of a five-year test plan."
"They whole LN network topology is not stored.  What's in the block chain is a set of historical payment channels.  From this data one can deduce what payments might possibly work in the future, providing nothing changes.  However, there are three types of changes that can happen.  Nodes can decide to shut down (e.g. hubs closing many channels),  nodes can go crash or go on temporary holiday (power failure, DDoS, natural disaster) or nodes can  exhaust the limit of funds in the channel.

The first two problems are typical of Internet routing problems and are very difficult to solve at scale in a distributed fashion.  Ultimately, Internet routing is not distributed, but is controlled by centralized authorities who assign blocks of IP addressess and autonomous system numbers.

The problem with LN is much more difficult, because not only is it subject to changes that make Internet routing difficult, but it also depends on traffic flows. Because funds are committed to channels, this becomes a multi-commodity problem.  This is a much more complicated problem than simply solving the routing problem that the internet solved.  And it should be noted that internet only solved this problem by punting the congestion control problem.  The internet only works because there is a certain amount of excess bandwidth.

And similarly, with the LN network.  The LN network can be made to route if the channels are funded with huge amounts and provide reserve capacity for most transactions.  This may work for microtransactions, but for normal size transactions this will involve tying up huge amounts of value (Bitcoins).  Unfortunately, capital is finite and expensive and not cheap.  There is no Moore's law applying here.  In fact, the entire concept behind LN is flawed.  It is based on the idea of tying up value (Bitcoins) to save transactions (computer cycles and bandwidth).  This has been done without doing the math so see if there is any possibility of a net saving whatsoever.  It is so incredibly cheap to process a Bitcoin transaction that tying up any amount of funds and putting them at risk of being hacked seems like a fool's errand.  If there were a case to be made that my (and u/jstolfi 's) intuition is wrong, then the LN promoters would have come up with hard numbers to show that LN represents a good tradeoff.

"Trying to use a financial system a few times and seeing that you weren't secured is not any kind of indication that the system ""works"".  The essence of financial systems is that they tell some people ""yes"" and other people ""no"" according to how many ""beans"" these people have.  And if there are only a few ""beans"" at play then a skilled hacker who has figured out how to hack the system would sit tight.  He would wait until there were enough beans to ensure his safe retirement, or, at very least, had enough money to buy a Lambo.  

Have you made LN transactions where your life would have changed if they were all gone?  If not, then your experience is irrelevant.

There are so many ways in which the LN would fail this test except for pocket change that it's hardly worth mentioning.  The simplest example is that all of your funds that are tied up in a LN channel have to be in a hot wallet.  So even if all of the Bitcoin and LN software and the very complex LN protocol are perfect you will still be at risk if the computer you are using is not 100% trustworthy.

In other words, LN will work fine with pocket change and provide some scaling benefit if channels are loaded with a few pockets worth of change.  To be used for anything else is highly questionable.  But the amount of money put into channels is critical to the amount of ""scaling"" that LN provides.  Unless many times the typical Bitcoin payment are put into a LN channel the there will be minimal ""scaling"" benefits of LN to Bitcoin. "

"The only way I could see it working is if a lightning node has no way of knowing if the transactions they are forwarding are for their immediate neighbor, or will be forwarded further. Even then, they can, or will be forced to, close a payment channel to a non-member node that seems to be transacting more than normal. This would be a serious issue for this node, because it locks up all funds in that payment channel for at least several weeks.

Really, the whole thing seems designed to force strict centralization."
"A modern 1 core of a CPU processes 100,000 sigops per second (doing ECDSA operations, primarily, the hashing takes minimal effort.)  With a typical Bitcoin transaction being 2 input and 2 outputs, this means that this core can process 50,000 transactions per second.  Other cores can be employed to do database operations and process network communications.  These are not a serious problem.  The net result of all of the above is that a modern computer can process a million Bitcoin transactions for a total cost of about $1 USD.  This means that a Bitcoin network of 10,000 nodes (obviously such a network is distributed) can process a Bitcoin transaction for under $0.01 USD.  These costs scale, that is to say, if there are twice as many transactions each computer will have to cost twice as much.  But it is easy to see that such a system is entirely practical, because the underlying costs are so damned low, and that is with today's technology.

So if the problem is paying for typical human payments, Bitcoin can completely scale.  It was designed to be a ""cash"" system and it works fine for payments where fees of $0.01 are considered relevant.

Transactions where the amount is under $1.00 USD can be handled by very simple systems which aggregate microtransactions and batch them.  It remains to be seen whether the complexity of systems such as LN are needed to remove the counter party risk for these transactions.  In most cases, there are other risks between the parties involved that go way beyond the financial risks, so the entire question of ""riskless"" transactions come into play here.  It is not clear that there will be any need for complex systems such as LN, which if they can be made to work will be only useful for a narrow range of transaction values, all sub one dollar.

I have been around for a long time, years before blockstream, and I have seen constant goalpost shifting. Unfortunately, Adam Backs word holds no weight when he constantly changes his mind. We are free to disagree on this point and I think that's what this conversation has come down to.
Where were your bitcoins stored at the time of the fork?  Every address that had bitcoins in it has the same number of BHC coins in that address on the bitcoin cash chain.
Yah I supported Core until I wanted to use my coin and saw the ridiculous fee. The best way to explain the problem is to ask people to use their Bitcoin. Not just going in and out of exchanges... which essentially makes exchanges into a bank. And sure you shouldn’t keep your coin on an exchange but how do people transfer it to their own wallet if the fees are so high? Every time you wanna sell some coins it’ll be $20 to transfer. I’m still hopeful for core but I’m not seeing any answer yet 
it also means you need to buy a $100 LN gift card to receive $100 LN payment. I cannot see how that can be a good thing for adoption.
something I am having trouble understanding is if I have bitcoin cash because I had bitcoin before the fork?

"You wouldn't.  Your bank would be the hub and they would open the channel and fund it for you by loaning the money to you.  So you would still be a debt slave and the bank would still be in charge.

"
Until it is possible for me, standing at the register at a Starbucks, to send a Bitcoin payment for cents in fees over a Lightning Hub, Lightning Network is vaporware.
I know that there is no leader, but they should have a PR person, a spokesman. All developers can pick and vote for one, and embassasor - I don't know. We should be needing to do research to find out about the status of LN. 99% of the users in coinbase have no idea what LN is all about. People need to know that bcash is centralized. 
"> Transactions where the amount is under $1.00 USD can be handled by very simple systems which aggregate microtransactions and batch them. It remains to be seen whether the complexity of systems such as LN are needed to remove the counter party risk for these transactions. In most cases, there are other risks between the parties involved that go way beyond the financial risks, so the entire question of ""riskless"" transactions come into play here. It is not clear that there will be any need for complex systems such as LN, which if they can be made to work will be only useful for a narrow range of transaction values, all sub one dollar.

I saw this post second. So now you're arguing for LN?

LN is not going to work for machines any better than it would work for people in Bitcoin Core.

I am of the firm opinion that Bitcoin cannot scale to handle machine economy. I think it can probably scale to handle human transactions."
None of that says anything about your experience in crypto currencies today. I'm done with this senseless argument.

Penn and Teller once did a bit (pun intended) where they stood on opposite sides of a slot machine with a random guy using it in a casino.  Penn starts yelling at the guy as if he did something that pissed him off.  Then he reaches into his coin bucket and chucks some coins into the guy's slot machine return slot.  He keeps yelling and whipping coins at the guy slot.  Teller eventually joins in.  The guy is like WTF?  But eventually joins in himself chucking coins at teller.

"I think this is a great spot to link to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dn3w4/point_1_what_is_this_obsession_with_the/)

""why is the whitepaper so important""


People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

"> see fit to insult the guy for not being rich already

hahaha he insulted him because if Andreas practiced even 1% of what he preaches, he'd be rich.  Roger simply exposed Andreas as a shill who doesn't believe anything he says."
"Yeah we see that happening now! Oh no we don't. 

Btc had 99% cap because it was the first and only. It's absolutely idiotic to think that only 1 will exist. Even if you have a great road map, someone will eventually have a new ideas."
"> this conflict between Bitcoin philosophies is a shit solution

that's an interesting perspective.  I'm curious why you think this, and what you think could be better?

The whole point of a global, permissionless currency is that no actor can control it and confiscate it or dilute your money or censor you.

That means that ""nobody control it.""  Which also means that ""anyone can control it.""  I agree this is a paradox, but it is fundamental.  If you put someone ""in charge"" then that someone can do good or bad things.  If you remove the idea that anyone is ""in charge"" then it means that anyone can try to ""take charge"" but they can't succeed unless enough people choose to go along.

We always knew that one day The Powers That Be would try to ""jam up"" Bitcoin.  And, with only one development team (which many of us said was a mistake) it seemed very easy to jam up Bitcoin: just co-opt the team and then introduce one poison pill after another until the patient dies.  Give the poison an important-sounding name like Segwit and the patient might even eat the poison thinking its the antidote.

In this the 1MB limit turned out to be a terrible design decision - all that was needed to ""jam up"" Bitcoin was to refuse to remove it.  It's like a Tesla with a 1MPH speed limiter on it.  Who could have guessed that it would be possible to convince lots of people that keeping the 1MPH speed limiter was an *absolute necessity?*  That part is a real eye-opener when you look into how they managed that.

But here's the thing: a whole bunch of us refused to take the poison pill - Bitcoin, the original project, is alive and well and back on track after a brief delay and now called ""Bitcoin Cash.""  Everyone who was an early adopter of Bitcoin has an equal stake in Bitcoin Cash and their capital is now once again invested in the original goals of the project that they originally invested in.  

So in hindsight, in many regards, Bitcoin is working as designed.  The mechanisms known to prevent capture-and-command (an evasive hardfork) were used and they worked.  In my view that's bullish as fuck."
It is a possibility. I won't discount it.
"Given the sheer power of a modern GPU like a 1080 or Vega, I feel they would beat everyone on a CPU or mobile device to the block rewards. With a coin that is in ASIC territory like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or Dash, the gulf becomes even wider. I think it would require a truly unique algorithm that put fairness above all else. Which might exist in one or two coins these days. I think there's one coin that can still be mined with a Raspberry Pi. Something like that with an active and ""activist"" developer community perhaps."
"Well I understand your concern. At the same time I think thats definitely one way in which we can transfer wealth from the western countrys to poor ones. And that way there would be a proof-of-work to get BitcoinCash rather then proof-of-wallet for a donation.
+ plus if they do a task to receive something, that makes much more sense then anything else I guess. "
"Been here since January 2012. Andreas has always promoted Layer 2 solutions. But was definitely more on-chain-centric in the past. 

I’ve said this before, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to say it at all, but he started receiving death threats a couple years ago. Real enough threats that he had to bring security guards to his public appearances. 

I don’t know what they were related to, but there’s no doubt his opinion has become much more ... careful ... in the last couple years.

Andreas is one of the few people in this world whose integrity I would never doubt. But I think he prefers staying alive to picking the wrong battles. Disclaimer: all just my opinion."
I'm not saying only one will exist. I'm saying one will have 99% cap. Big difference.
Bitcoin cash, and these forks and this conflict between Bitcoin philosophies is a shit solution, and the system should have been designed not to have any of that from the get go. It was poor foresight. IT should have been obvious to him when he was creating it. Maybe he didn't think it would ever be a problem, because it would never actually get so successful.

I recognize that it might be a fundamental issue with the way Bitcoin is designed. 

It should not be possible to fork, and it should not be possible to capture. 

That might be a tough problem to solve, but it's a necessary one, imo, and in order for a crypto currency to have any real worth in the long run, that would need to be solved, and it is also necessary that transactions should be able to occur quickly.

" The fact that there can be so many sorts of bitcoin, pills you can choose to take or not take, is a fundamental problem with the currency. You might be happy with bitcoin cash, but who is to say that in another couple of years there will be another problem and another choice to make?

Right, but that argument doesn't exactly hold when long term viability of a coin is relevant. I'm not trying to troll here, I'm genuinely curious.

You are in no position to tell me that good cars get boring. What if your wife gets boring in 1 year?
You are very wrong in this but let’s say for a second you are right... then why not expand the block size at least until the mythical always close to ready LN is fully ready to alleviate the burden?  
"That's cool, but BCH's block would also be full, right now, if it was receiving the same level of volume that BTC is getting right now. The market will decide and it's clearly putting more money into BTC (and ETH...and Dash) than BCH. Why? No innovation. 

BCH is nothing more than a bitcoin clone with bigger blocks...that's not enough scaling for global adoption. We all have to do better, and we certainly need as many developers and programmers on the crypto scene as possible. This is definitely not a zero-sum game. "
"But when that hypothetical ""someday"" comes along, why use Bitcoin Cash if something better will have come along?"
Samson Mow is your friend.
Bitcoin is what everyone invested in, all the mining, marketing etc to get us this far and bitcoin holders also received BCH as a back up plan for their investments.. If BTC doesn't survive, it should be BCH and anything else would be a whole lot more damaging to crypto as a store of value.   
Iota may be great someday, but it's currently new and experiencing growing pains.  Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin as many of us have used it for years.  It's what we signed up for.  Bank the unbanked.
"Great comment. Once the ""bitcoin brand"" no longer is perfect and unblemished, and you look for alternatives, you don't stop looking once you read about BitCoin cash. 

Etherium can bank the unbanked. Iota can bank the unbanked. In fact both can do a lot more than just what BitCoin Cash (or BitCoin, or Litecoin) can do."
Large blocks are cool, but I have to say I'm really frustrated about how little options there exist for using non-BTC cryptocurrencies. Crypto seems to have become a massive get-rich-quick scheme without any real adoption happening anywhere at all. Things were so much more exciting back in 2013.
Well in poor regions it can just start from top to bottom! A 'richguy' gets his hands on BitcoinCash and then starts to pay people in BitcoinCash. Then they can transact with each other etc. If we find a good way to securely and effectively spread money in country's that are in need. I would donate 100$ worth of BCH to 100 or 1000 people there to get the thing rolling. I just don't know how yet. Better then that would it actually be to let them do a service of some kind. Something online that the western world wants or likes and we could pay then with BCH... *just brainstorming here

Thinking anything will take 99% of the market cap is a losing bet.
"The point that Core supporters often seem to miss is that blocks are only as heavy as the transactions they contain.  What makes the blockchain heavier is **more transactions**.  It does not matter if those transactions are spread out over 1,000 1mb blocks or in one 1gb block.  All small blocks do is artificially slow the rate at which the blockchain's weight increases.  If that rate does not match the rate at which users are attempting to generate new transactions, the only result is the network becoming more expensive for *everybody*.

The obstacle in running a validating non-mining node, then, is not storage or processing power, because the cost of congestion to the network, paid via the fee market, could have been spent on hardware (those who use the network most heavily are also the most likely to have reason to run a validating node).  Rather, the obstacle is *maybe* bandwidth, as that is an infrastructural issue that in some places may not be accessible even with deep, deep pockets.

So OP is exactly right: block size limit is nothing more than an onboarding rate limiter.  In fact, it's worse than that, because increase in demand also raises the floor of minimum transaction value, meaning even those who managed to get onboard may find themselves unable to transact.  "
"well if you transact once a week, it may be 500 dollars per year or a thousand a year to do such; this will only get worse, as more people come in; that is an unsustainable problem.
now they must be incredible prognosticators to know whether people will use a LN or not, before they know the interface or all the details of the reality of that completely different way of transacting than the current protocol, and the fact people will like it."
"Yeah but how are they supposed to run a full node then?

"> bigger block sizes is only a short term solution

I disagree.

""The problem is that higher frame sizes and frame rates are only a short term solution, to stream video in the future will require a way to achieve ultra-high definition without increasing bandwidth.""

\ - some guy in 1997 arguing that we need a ""scaling solution"" for video streaming"
The problem is bigger block sizes is only a short term solution. Kicking the can a few yards down the road doesn't solve the problems that stop Crypto for being used for ever day transactions. It just makes it better for a while.

^(Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be. Ask about it on r/btc)"
Exactly what I was thinking. Bitcoin Cash is all well and good, but I'm struggling to figure out why it's *better* than other options which try to solve the same issue as Bitcoin Cash.
I can't speak for the old days, but I when I heard about bitcoin or the first time. I already had this idea about it. but it seemed out of grasp for my young mind. seeing the hype and the possibility. I definitely am a believer in creating a world that is beneficial for most (if not all). and thats not the way it is going now!
"Yeah! Let's use the poor people in poor countries to do shitty jobs, like a bitcoin Mechanical Turk! If we start ""banking the unbanked"" with such a condescending attitude, it's starting well. /s"
"Watch and learn. The reason bitoin lost this position was that core devs f*cked up the original scaling roadmap.

Altcoins got a real chance to compete for the #1 place.

The world will gravitate towards 1 currency with a fixed money supply."
Fraud-response as a failsafe doesn't go well with modern DoS attacks. A huge monetary incentive to DoS - just what we needed, right? Meh.
">But: to participate in Bitcoin requires you to have your coins in a wallet you control.

It's not even just that, but that to buy ANY sort of cryptocurrency, you NEED a bank account and/or a credit card. It's all fine and dandy to have KYC/AML but that forever prevents people in poor countries from buying BTC. And don't talk to me about local fucking bitcoin dot com, that's not the solution either for someone who makes $50/month in the countryside of Cambodia, Bolivia or Burkina Faso.

"ha, I'm probably that ""some dude on the internet"" 

I'm Venezuelan (luckily a US Citizen now), I know what it's like for my family to be in an environment where the minimum monthly salary is less than USD $10 thanks to brutal devaluation which the Venezuelan dictators have used to enslave everyone. They didn't have to take the money out of anybody's account, the simply imposed strict access to foreign currencies, regulated the prices of the USD and started printing money like crazy which basically stole the value of the money of everyone holding it.

Now they have people do whatever they want for peanuts while they steal millions.

We should not be concerned with amounts sent, who cares what the amount is, they're just bytes like any others, it's elitist to leave small transactions out, the system that can send the smallest amounts will be the most powerful IMO. the world needs a micro-transaction economy to allow for all use cases in all countries."
Because proponents of BCasH (i.e. Roger Ver) see fit to insult the guy for not being rich already, while Andreas continues to spread the IDEA of cryptos. He's not shilling for his own investments, unlike most of us (keep it real).

>It should not be possible to fork, and it should not be possible to capture. 

Ok, I disagree, and say that these are mutually exclusive alternatives. But, good luck finding or creating a crypto that meets these criteria!"
So there is a lot of anti-bitcoin talk on this sub, mainly on the issue of transaction times. That's great - I agree with you. But what makes Bitcoin Cash a better solution than other coins like Iota?
"the ""guy that first designed Bitcoin"" proposed the ""fix"" to the ""problem"" in 2010, you know that, right?  his ""fix"" is literally the basis for Bitcoin Cash."
"It was solved, the block size limit was meant to be temporary until thin clients were available.
"
">That's cool, but BCH's block would also be full, right now, if it was receiving the same level of volume that BTC is getting right now. 

That's false. Sorry. "
"Would not call core developers normies. I like to think a bunch of anti-business, academics and engineering students (all whom never had to deal with life in the real world aka business and free markets) took over Bitcoin, after they got paid by the Bilderberg group, who probably told them they were geniuses, further ensuring a god complex in these people.

The normies only came after, they are not primarily responsible for the pyramid scheme.

Academics and engineers are taught to respect central authority (Blockstream/AXA), and without economic pressure, tend to create solutions to problems that don't exist like...

It's a shame.  I think the guy is brilliant.  It's beyond me why he hasn't spoken up about the abuses of core.  I saw one of his talks lately and I gather his major argument is that there is no possible way for bitcoin to scale enough.  He foresees a lot of what I consider silly uses for the blockchain.  Like all those micropayments, 5 cents here and 5 cents there for reading articles online.  I don't see it catching on and if it did there's a proper use case for a side chain.  He's talked about an average household having 50 connected devices where even a lightbulb is online using up blockchain resources or being charged incrementally as you go on that uber ride.  I don't envision that there would be a need for or a demand for these kinds of technologies down the road.  I have no interest in ever being so connected.  So in my little world at least Bitcoin does scale now and into the future.  Go BitcoinCash!
I don't need luck finding it. If it is impossible, then I think crypto is fundamentally flawed, and will never gain worldwide adoption by average people.
How do i get it off?!! No other wallets support number versioning! WTF
"i didnt want to turn this into a bch vs btc thing and really hate having to take the opposite side of these discussion in this sub reddit. but sw - sw address is cheap and fast. BCH txs are cheap but not necessary fast. you can look at the varying block times of 15-35 minutes for this by view the last 400 blocks in any blockchain explorer ETH tx get stupid slow depending on how many icos or user of cryptokitties happen to be on. (note your tx vs a smart contract are executed differently depending on the contracts minimum gas requirements.) based on the actual contents of the txs of the last 50 blocks on https://etherscan.io/

as far as centralization goes in my opinion block size has nothing to do with it and that participant miners have everything to do with it. i look at how many committed miners there are and their locations and scratch my head at how its not considered centralized based on https://cash.coin.dance/blocks which shows 1/4 mined by roger's companies , 1/4 mined by Jihan Wu infrastructure and a single unidentified miner clearing 54% of all txs.

really there is no great solution right now. 2018 will be intresting to see who solved vertical and horizontal issues first at a growing scale."
Interesting, thanks for taking the time to respond. [This whole discussion chain](https://medium.com/@ecurrencyhodler/how-much-will-you-have-left-if-you-keep-leaving-it-in-various-ln-islands-until-ready-to-close-c3342a06d0b7) might also be interesting to read, it's becoming hard to consolidate though. Re: your answers, I have answered them in the gist to keep it in one place.
and if it doesn't?
"> BTC IOU

Like a digital tab.

> Everyone using state-managed fiat shitcoins - worst case scenario

This is what never made sense to me. Why would that ever take off? Visa/Mastercard already works well. If you end up with another state controlled currency, you didn't solve much.

The promise of cryptos is that there's no central entity that can control it. If bitcoin can't do that, it would simply fail and another coin will take over. Bitcoin's failure would be a big bump in the road for sure, but cryptos already got over several big bumps."
"I hear a lot of folks, especially at r/bitcoin chastizing this or that transaction because someone didn't clip coupons or eat during the business lunch special.

I sent from a Coinomi wallet to an exchange and the suggested tx was $34.  I cut it to $8 and it still took over 4 hours.  Meanwhile, my BCH transaction was good in about 15 minutes and it was free.  It was my 4th FREE BCH transaction in a row.  I don't mean .03 cents free, I mean 0.0 cents nothing free.

More than 90% of BTC's rise in the last 2 months is NEW MONEY.  They new money doesn't know where to clip coupons.  They will pay the $34 fee.

Less than 8mb block size is stupid.  Actually, its cunning smart: it is banks who have brainwashed an entire community using centuries old FUD and PR campaigns.

""2mb blocks = centralization""

LOL

you can't make this shit up"
"All good points.  

Although in theory with great inefficiency there probably are ways around any government controls of things like VPN traffic.  You can encapsulate anything within any other seemingly innocent thing, at least in theory.

But yes, all good points and worth keeping in mind.

"
Short version - i use crypto to send funds every day and my experience doesnt match the posts i see here. Longer version. There are many levers you can pull to make your tx more expensive in bitcoin right now including using coinbase. I asked roger why he choose the most expensive method in one of his demos and was unanswered . I asked why he had 10 inputs at another point and  was unanswered
