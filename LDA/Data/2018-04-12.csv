I'm in favor of Bitcoin as a currency and also against speculation. It's what causes volatility. The speculation hypes are also the reason why fees explode sometimes. (see bitinfocharts.com) Both is at their own cost.

Ah, banks.  You guys are such fuckers.
It depends on the residing country's classification.  I believe that in America, cryptocurrency falls into an asset class.
This is what I would have thought as well. Anyway, who buys bitcoin on credit? Doesn't seem like a sound plan.
"Although banks are not normal businesses. They receive a special license to conduct banking activity in return for following various regulations.

One of the main tenets of regulation is to treat customers fairly. Charging extra fees for specific uses may not be fair and if so they can’t do it. "

I don't understand what you get out of spamming subs like this?  Can you help me understand?
It looks like he was trying to comment on a reply but end up just commenting on the post
Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud last year and now JP Morgan is involved in a potential fraud. Get it?

">Charging extra fees for specific uses may not be fair and if so they can’t do it. 

But wouldn't you know that according to what the regulation says? If it isn't readily understandable what constitutes a violation it makes for very poor law.

>One of the main tenets of regulation is to treat customers fairly.

Do you have a specific regulation which cites such an arbitrary stipulation?  I think you opened with the argument that it would violate a regulation or license, and then went to ""it wouldn't be fair"" but there has to be more to what you're saying. Ultimately though I don't see it as a good argument countering the idea that you should be free to charge what you want, just as you are free not to engage in such a contract.

Its his day job.
Oh the irony.
No 
I don't get it. 
Oh the irony
It looks like he was commenting on a reply but it didn't need an explanation.
I don't get it
"It looks like people are creating a nested thread just for the heck of it.

I don't get it."
Oh the irony.
This was because they were charging fees when even buying with debit. 
I don't get this thread
Oh the irony.
I don't get it.
Who's the scammer now Jamie?
"Get those pitchforks, get those motherfucking PITCHFORKS right now. 

These are the infuriating fucks back in the day that used to say along with the government “these will never be currencies”, or “we won’t ever be accepting crypto as a valid transaction means”. 

You motherfuckers..."
Well that didn't take long.
Pretty lame, but honestly not very surprised
"so a suit has been filed, does that mean they are *being* sued or they have been sued? ""gets sued"" implies (not explicitly) that there's already been a ruling, does it not? ""is being sued"" might be more accurate IMO"
Big banks will have to eat a lot of humble pie in the next years, that will do them a lot of good.
Am I the only one that thinks this makes sense? Are crypto purchases basically not cash advances? You can always buy crypto with a debit card.
"A business should be able to charge whatever fee it wants for its service. You are free to decline to use that service.

JP Morgan is a shitty, corrupt, precious metal manipulating group of criminals anyways, so why are you doing business with them?"
It is interesting to see such actions taken to suppress cryptocurrencies.
"Now the real question is, will the fees or punishment outweigh the gains they saw doing this?

Usually big business, especially banks, get what's effectively a slap on the wrist for them because fines and punishment doesn't scale well to in general and certainly not to entities of their size."
"That's so weird

""JP Morgan charged extra fees and higher interest rates on the cash advances than on credit cards."""
I'm flabbergasted!!!

You have a way with words

Yeah, I think we're looking at a multi-decade transition. Some wild times ahead.
