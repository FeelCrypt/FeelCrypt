Blasphemy. You’re auto-banned from r/bitcoin!"
Analog tech is astounding.
">	The internet was restricted for decades and still is. I don’t recall getting 200 phone lines installed to my house in the early 90s to get 200x58k bandwidth and I’m in the same position today.

Limited by tech, not by an arbitrary low limit.

>	Bitcoin is a POW driven, decentralized consensus network on top of a gossip protocol. There are real world engineering limitations and trade-offs involved and no amount of illiterate hand waving will make those go away.

I agree.

I also agree that the PoW technical limitations are above 1MB and can be improved by increment in the future..

Like internet did in the past.

(Also second layer have limitations too, somehow that it seems to never quite enter the debate)"
Joe Rogan had a t1 connection in the 90's so he could play quake without lag. Not the best analogy
"> illiterate hand waving

Says you"
But this image doesn't have a surplus of lines. That's how many lines that were actually needed at the time.
Thats different those low voltage wires cant kill you. How do you work on the top lines without a bucket truck in those days, shut the whole city down?
Please don't provoke the drama.   You're just doing the bidding of the big banks by propegating their plan to divide the community.  This is childish.
I use Bitcoin. You are the buttcoiner.
"> those which already have widespread consensus

If I am right, their ""widespread consensus"" is manufactured and fake. So 'the only ideas permitted to be discussed in rbitcoin are those which already have [been approved by BTC HQ]'. I hope everyone stops assuming BTC has a large community of humans that could have a widespread consensus. It is hard to avoid supporting their agenda when falling for their false narratives."
"Well according to /u/gizram84 censorship is justified if you are worng or have the wrong opinion..

Facepalm.."
"Pardon my ignorance, but in contrast to analog, what makes digital tech more than just ""copper wires""?"
"I guess Joe Rogan could have run a one man ""decentralized"" Bitcoin network then too!"
It's a surplus for this pole and this area.
Those are telephone/telegraph cables in the pic. Low voltage.
Probably good to understand the context of the subject before you criticize people.  These are clearly telecommunication lines.
lol use it to what, hold? Eat shit troll
All /r/btc talks about is /r/bitcoin. You guys are like a jealous ex.
Digital is an abstraction created by us on top of analog tech.  Analog is using the physical properties of nature where digital uses digitized instructions to perform complex operations on top of Turing machines.
Ic and software maybe?
I mean probably.
So butt hurt. But I get it. I'd be butt hurt too if I bought into Ver's cringetastic bimbo, lambo and flippening propaganda in 2017.
Stop being shit and we'll stop pointing it out.
">	All /r/btc talks about is /r/bitcoin. You guys are like a jealous ex.

Ok but maybe you can explain me why it is not legitimate to do so?"
Digital is less accurate than analog, but also contains less noise. Strange paradox
"Yeah I am so butthurt that I no longer associate with a shitcoin that gets slow and expensive when anyone bothers to move their BTC, who has fucktard cheerleaders like yourself for a ""community"". 

Seems you're the butthurt one to come here and spread your bullshit daily. Sell your BCH at the bottom or are you just a sad wanker?"
Digital is more accurate but potentially, given the right assumptions, less precise.
  Cry some more, scam victim :(
"the only ideas permitted to be discussed in rbitcoin are those which already have widespread consensus

It's not even a joke"
Telephone.
Speed of light always seems to come up, but that's a silly argument this early in the game.  There is plenty of room to scale before that ceiling is met.
">	Perfect illustration of BCH’s scaling plans.

AKA as the original design."
Can't believe no one has said this yet but the pic looks like a visualization of LN.  Centralized pole and all those wires.
"Is that a telephone or electricity network?

I mean they both scale by using centralised hubs no?"
absloutly ! You're true
Self gilded trolling is perfect illustration of how retarded your average buttcoiner is
Hate to be the lineman working on that grid.
It's kind of funny. I'm not saying it's wrong, it' actually a pretty good way to scale fast, but this picture represents a hardware approach. Just throw more iron at the problem. Kind of what bch does.
How many gigamegs is that?
"Speaking of new technology.  

The first Berlin BSV hackathon is underway -->

https://twitter.com/VJRiddell/status/1129760703819243523"
So you mean scale by optimisation not by adding more block space?
">	Blasphemy. You’re auto-banned from r/bitcoin!

Thank you for the preventive ban.

This protect  rbitcoin against ideas, concepts and debate. Those have been redefined as attacks."
That would be a 44% improvement!
"Exactly, every new tech future potential is completly unpredictable, restricting it because ""it can't scale"" is ridiculous..  


In what world we would be living if aviation would have been restricted in its first decades? same for internet?"
Correct. The humor of this picture is that it is an image of something that doesn't scale. This is what a world with electricity using DC would look like. Edison was pushing this approach. Tesla pushed for AC. It scaled nicely. Bitcoin is the ac of blockchains. It scales by pushing most of the congestion problem into a second layer. Sort of like AC pushes the wire congestion into sub stations. Additionally, AC pushes the wire congestion problem into the home where much of the AC power is converted to DC (ever wonder why your computer has that giant box between it and the plug?). Bitcoin cash looks like the picture above. It's infrastructure doesn't scale. The network itself takes on the burden of bigger blocks. The humor to me is in the fact that people here are too stupid to see the irony in explaining their position with memes that negate their position.
Looks pretty well mate, I saw server rooms where all cables were tangled.
"""More iron"" where there is a dearth of it, not a surplus like this image. Stop being disingenuous. After all, it's BTC who wants every person to use their Raspberry Pis to run full nodes. If anything, their harebrained schemes resemble this far more than BCH."
In 1995 Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of the internet predicted that the internet couldn't scale and would collapse by 1996.  Sometimes even brilliant people can be spectacularly wrong.
"Robert Metcalfe is the inventor of ethernet; not sure I'd say he was the inventor of the Internet.

The growth of the backbone routing tables in the late 90's was a big problem, and yes, we came close to the limits (mainly RAM) of the hardware that was widely deployed.  But this was averted  by a combination of changes to the way address space was managed and, of course, improvements in hardware - and the growing populatity of the Internet, which made it commercially viable to deploy new hardware.

EDIT: I've no idea though whether Robert Metcalf declared that the end of the Internet was nigh, but he may well have done.  Such concerns were frequently raised in that era (and indeed, had no action been taken, the predictions would probably have come to pass)."
Well, in this photo, the big technology that wasn't invented was MULTIPLEXING.   That's a pretty important one to help scale things.
Perfect illustration of BCH's scaling plans.

"I worked in telecommunications for awhile. The most amazing thing is that all this “high tech” stuff when it comes down to the raw physical components are just copper wires with pin connectors, to state it very simply. Always blew my mind to be installing some high band antenna/dish and looking at the raw parts, you’d think you were just banging rocks together or doing plumbing or something. Mathematics/the unseen forces of nature are truly astounding.

Like a sub station ... just a bunch of coils and wires, but the functions they are performing on the electricity takes a masters degree to really understand."
