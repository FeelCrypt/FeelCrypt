you're right, in a way. However, cash is WORSE. It only goes down in value.
Yay!
I refer to what Purse.io promote on their site.
"> No one is claiming that Amazon is accepting BTC

Go to rbitcoin and all other Blockstream censored channels and you will find such statements regularly. Last week was particularly intense.

I guess somehow you were blind to it, despite your eagle eyes on this sub.

In the meantime we can all buy anything we want in Overstock with our Bitcoin Cash coins. Thank you for trying to pretend that is not true!"
I guess that since I’m blind to it, I’d appreciate some links.  I eagerly await your response.
"Didn’t say that you couldn’t buy at Overstock with BCH, just that the OPs post is blatantly false.

News flash!  USA accepts British Pounds!!

(through a currency exchange service)"
Fresh-Picked Cherries!
Do you have any idea how much mindless nonsense I read on that sub every day? Don't ask me to do your work, reading it once is more than enough for me.
You’re also wrong about how you think the gift card purchase works.  I buy a gift card directly from 3rd party vendor( eGifter, Gyft, etc.).  I use the gift card directly with the vendor.  Not at all like you described.  
"Shop accepts Pound Sterling (via Credit Card)

Overstock accepts BCH.

Not blatantly false. Gosh why do you have to come up with things like this. It's as if you're wounded at the thought of it!

Seriously, relax about it. It's good news for BCH users and it's legitimate to publish it. Jeez."
"Thanks, you just proved my point.  No one (especially me) is claiming that Amazon is accepting BTC.  The OPs statement is horribly misleading.  

Overstock accepts Bitcoin directly.
Overstock does NOT accept Bitcoin Cash directly."
It's fake news ,  bch shills are doing everything they can to pump this coin.  How's that working for you?
You are so negative.
I know that Gyft and and eGifter accepts Bitcoin for Amazon gift cards, so I guess it’s exactly the same as saying Overstock accepts Bitcoin Cash (only when previously converted to Bitcoin).

Why do people say that?  What does that even mean?  Bright?  Where did you learn that slogan?  Lol all love bro, but for real what if it's bright at times and then gets dim?  
"No not the same at all. One's a classified site to buy Amazon gift cards in a very convoluted way, the other is a payment system.

Don't try to compare the two. One is real, the other is propaganda fluff (Blockstream's specialty)."
My future is very bright, and if not mine, my kids, and if not them, their kids. I hope you sleep better knowing that.  
I am not the best to ask this to. I think you can post on this sub to ask everyone. It is better :)
Yawn.
"Ha ha ha.  Called your bluff and you have nothing.   Since you’re on it every day, you should have some links that you remember, no?  

“Don’t ask me to do your work” = “I’m talking out my ass”"
I'm just being objective.  I recognize crypto for what it is and where it's place is in the world's economy.  The OP needs perspective.
"> Convoluted? I buy a gift card with Bitcoins and then i buy things on Amazon with said gift card. Seems pretty easy to me.

I buy a gift card, then I show the seller of the gift card what I want from Amazon. Then the seller buys the product with the gift card and sends me the goods (or not if I'm unlucky).

Then I can say ""Look, I bought on Amazon with btcs!""

..."
Just curious then, how do i go about getting my BCH out? I have previously used Coinbase, but printed my private keys before the split, so if I understand correclty, i should be able to receive to have access to BCH then with those keys? My concern would be losing my BTC though by accessing that private key? Sorry for the stupid questions : /
"Convoluted?  I buy a gift card with Bitcoins and then i buy things on Amazon with said gift card.  Seems pretty easy to me.  

The payment system for Overstock only works when the merchant accepts the Bitcoin (not BCH) at the end of the transaction.  Propaganda, or in this case, a direct false statement, is when OP stated that Overstock accepts BCH.  It doesn’t.  

I got excited too, but then pretty pissed off at the attempt to fool the public."
FUD
"Let's retake both points after the HF, shall we?

RemindMe! 47 days ""did BCH die, and SW2x fail due to the fact that it was all a trick by UASFers to get SW activated?"""
"> BCC will be rejected by the market and plummet to negligible values.

... which it has.
It has grand mal seizures every few days due to EDA, sending its inflation skyrocketing.
Hardly anyone is using it... save miners exploiting it.

So, yes; lols."
