"I didn't make any joke about pee first of all, that was the other guy. Second of all, you are literally so butthurt over nothing.

Dude it’s okay you obviously just didn’t get the joke. You’re making yourself look like an idiot now.
Yes

So you can't say, i don't smoke, i want a glass?
But if I wanted to grow adoption of BCH or any crypto why would I purchase another currency? 
hm ok

Man this is a great: Blockstream's Greatest Hits.
This is the first step. Hopefully other countries follow suit. 
"That’s wierd,

Are you saying added to income tax if held less than a year and then tax free afterwards?"
You can have 0 income yet incur a long term  37% tax hit in certain states if you cash out  anything over the first $153000 in coin. 
"> Yes, but not having capital gains when using crypto as a payment method is huge too. This means you can effectively save your wealth in crypto and use it as a day-to-day currency without having to deal with capital gain taxes with every payment.

Correct me if I am wrong but you still have to deal with capital gain in Germany.

But if you prove you own them for more than a year you pay no tax."

Many things in Europe are better than in America. Education, healthcare, etc
I agree. 
"I'd _love_ to pay a flat 25% capital gains tax compared to the shit I have to do here in germany. The ""0% if you held them longer than a year"" goes out the window if you trade too much or do it with the intention to make gains, for example. What utter unclear BS."
"I looked into the German guidance again. If I understand the situation right, then

1.  cryptos are treated similar to vouchers if you want to buy and sell them (no VAT). The German ruling is based on the ECJ ruling on a case about buying and selling BTC:

>The transactions that Mr Hedqvist intends to carry out are thus limited to the purchase and sale of ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency units in exchange for traditional currencies, such as the Swedish crown, or vice versa. It is not apparent from the order for reference that those transactions would include payments made using ‘bitcoin’.

2. If you use crypto to pay for services/goods, again you don't have to pay VAT on the cryptos you buy for that purpose and apart from the normal VAT, you don't have to pay any taxes on top.

It is important that this is tax guidance, not some groundbreaking ruling that equates private money and legal tender. 

Mildly interesting is that mining is VAT-free according to the letter and also mildly interesting is that it accepts the existence of crypto as some kind of private money that people are free to use. 

>That being said, you would still be taxed if you convert your bitcoin to fiat (as I understand). 

Yes, just not VAT. But capital gains taxes apply (if you sell before 12m) and IMO also income tax, but other German redditors think different. Exchanging BTC for BCH would still be a taxable event, but again capital gains taxes, not VAT. The guidance is only concerned with VAT (which in Germany is a federal tax, unlike the USA).

So, I am not really sure the situation is that different from the USA."
"not just coindesk. Most of the outlets spin it that way. More bang for the buck, I guess. Or maybe just lazy copy-pasting. Despicable ""journalists"" either way! Too lazy to even read the 3 short pages of the original document. They didn't even link it, wtf.
"
Germany waived the long term capital gains tax on crypto a while ago, which is a significant improvement over a lot of other countries.
"> currency not an investment

Exactly. They regulate it like a currency yet tax it like a commodity. Just a money grab plain and simple."
"> And not paying capital gains?

nope. The ruling regards only *sales tax*."
If you hold longer than a year (and haven't lent any), then there are no capital gains in Germany. If you hold less than a year, then it's taxed.
"Indeed, I now read the German source document, it's about VAT on the Bitcoin only.

Very misleading CoinDesk article."
Thanks.
Yes, but not having capital gains when using crypto as a payment method is huge too. This means you can effectively save your wealth in crypto and use it as a day-to-day currency without having to deal with capital gain taxes with every payment.
LOL It's common sense.. less taxes to pay.. more money to invest, hell even save for much larger investments later. 
"> 0% if you held them longer than a year

Is still pretty fucking awesome compared to gulag USA"
Only in America...
"are you german? It's pretty much established that a crypto sell incurs income tax. It's ""Veräusserung sonstiger Wirtschaftsgüter nach §19 Einkommensteuergesetz""
"
are you sure? afaik if you hold less than a year, gains are taxed as income, longer than a year - capital gains.
I'm not located in Germany, sadly.
How does this work if you move there?
just to clarify, are you saying that if i buy AAPL for 100eur today and sell for 200eur tomorrow i pay nothing on 100eur income?
I believe you are correct and AFAIK this has always been the case in Germany.
"Well you and I are in agreement that BTC/BCH shouldn't be taxed. I consider it currency not an investment.

I'm just happy that for me I was able to report it and not get taxed."

"the amount of money earned per time invested?

"they're not well-informed, I fear. Prevalent opinion in the tax-threads on the german bitcointalk subforum point to income tax. My tax advisor also agrees: income tax.

"I agree with your suggestion to wait as long as possible.

I find it a stretch to say ""there are no real rules"" and the interpretation as Bitcoin gains being gains from Veräußerungsgeschäften is not far-fetched. I don't know who, but I think it was ""officially"" said that Bitcoins are ""sonstige Wirtschaftsgüter"" in the context of german tax regulation (the BaFin has a different view, I know). I don't see much wiggle room to get out of this except new law being passed.
"
sorry, I keep equating VAT and sales tax. Thanks for the correction.
As per my tax accountant he is correct. (Capital gain less than a year and then 0%)
"> are you sure? afaik if you hold less than a year, gains are taxed as income, longer than a year - capital gains.

No. 
  * held less than a year: taxed as income, but 0%
  * held more than a year: taxed as income progressively up to 46% or whatever
  * if trading was gewerblich: (no matter how long you held): Gewerbesteuer, income tax"
"EINKOMMENSTEUER* wenn Haltefrist < 1 Jahr

NIX STEUER wenn Haltefrist >= 1 Jahr

*privates Veräußerungsgeschäft

"In fact, the CoinDesk article is extremely misleading, as it implies that no taxes whatsoever would be paid for a payment such as buying a coffee.

After reading the German source document, it seems this is about VAT only, that the Bitcoin used to pay a coffee will not be subjected to VAT, but the Bitcoin is still subject to capital gains taxes and the coffee itself to VAT.

Edit: added *it*"
Uh that I really don't know. I'm neither a German nor an American. I live in another European country.
"None of it should be taxed. Taxation of capital is theft and ""progressive"" taxation is theft motivated by envy. "
">Many things in Europe are better than in America

If you stop right there, we are in agreement... the architecture, the cheeses, the history, the music...

>Education, healthcare, etc

Highly debatable. Depends on who you are and what you want to get out of the system. "
0% after a year is heaven compared to USA
But then you're trading as either day job or side-gig. Seems sensible to tax it the same, for example what's the difference between that and earning money from say waiting tables?
"> are you german? It's pretty much established that a crypto sell incurs income tax. It's ""Veräusserung sonstiger Wirtschaftsgüter nach §19 Einkommensteuergesetz""

Well I took 3 independent tax advice and they all pointed to capital gain (like for currencies I believe)"
Addendum: There is not an official document issued by BaFin on this and most people at the Finanzamt don't even know crypto. If you've got gains which are converted to euro and thus are better trackable you should wait as long as possible for the Steuererklärung this year because there might be more ruling incoming. Especially ccrypto - crypto trades are especially questionable since current law would lead to a Veräußerungsgeschäft, which then would be taxable even if you have no real euro gains. Beware: There is no real rules for this, it just is derived from current rules regarding stocks etc.
VAT in fact, but otherwise you are correct.
"> If you hold longer than a year (and haven't lent any), then there are no capital gains in Germany. 

unless your actions are deemed ""gewerblich"", which can easily happen, for example if you had the intention to make gains or you made too many trades. In that case every sell incurs tax (gewerbesteuer + income tax in the end, of course)

"At least they can’t freeze your bitcoin when you go to jail.

"This. Germany is far away from accepting anything here. It's basically the worlds taillight when it comes to support Crypto Currencies. Nothing in media about it. The chance to encounter BTC (or any altcoin) there in reallife is literally zero.

Germany (0).

Lol.



"
I wish Sweden would as well...
">you still have to pay income tax on your gains (and capital gains taxes on top if you hold less than a year).

Only capital gains tax, so no tax at all if you hold for at least a year."
"My tax accountant could maybe,

I can PM you the email of a tax specialist I consulted."
"All, as the title states crypto users will not be taxed for using crypto as a means of payment. For example, if you buy a coffee in Germany with bitcoins you won’t be taxed on your purchase like you would in the US/CAD. In the US/CAD, crypto is treated as a commodity, so barter rules apply when you buy “stuff” like coffee. 

So in the US, the fair market value (FMV) of your coffee at the time of purchase is determined, and it is considered that you sold your crypto for that value. So if you had bought the bitcoin for a $1 and spent it on coffee that was worth $10, you would be taxed for the $9 gain. 

NOW - in Germany, that is not the case. You can buy the coffee and because the bitcoin is not a commodity, you don’t have to consider FMV or anything. You’ll still pay sales taxes etc. on that coffee, the same as you would had you paid in cash. You will also STILL pay taxes if you sell your bitcoin for Fiat in Germany. 

Hopefully that clears up a lot of your questions. I’m also basing this all on the article as I’m not German nor am I a tax professional, so take this with a grain of salt. 

My 2 Satoshis. "
I'm dual citizen German American - bought crypto with my US bank account. I've held for over a year. Is it best to cash out into my German bank account or US? Does it make a difference that I made the initial purchases using a US based account?

Other governments need to take note. There is no point wasting time and money trying to fight progression. It is an exhaustive and fruitless exercise. Adopt, adapt, and say adieu to fiat.
Hail victory
So if I buy ETH using BTC as payment currency and later I'm gonna buy NANO using ETH as payment currency, then I won't get charged for taxes because of trading? I just payed?
This makes me wanna buy monero...
This is not as good as it sounds. You don't pay VAT when changing crypto, but it is handled as an asset, so if you sell within a year you have to pay taxes on gains.
Another country leading better than the US.
"The title is misleading.

Legal tender is something you can pay taxes with. This guidance report is about not collecting VAT for Bitcoin payments."
++
This is huge. I hope other European countries will follow suit.
Meanwhile in the US, the IRS is trying to steal people’s money. 
Good for Germany. Way to go boys!
Classifying cryptocurrencies as a good rather than a money is the biggest blunder a country can make (looking at you, US) and will have to be reversed to avoid deep inconsistencies.
"It's a special thing for Bitcoin and some other investments like Gold, IIRC. In case of AAPL, you'd pay captial gains (""Abgeltungssteuer"")."
"No, it's not ""capital gain"". That would be ""Abgeltungssteuer"" (used for stocks and stuff). It's ""income tax"" due to sale of ""other goods"". Paragraph 19 EkStG.

"bullshit, you still pay income tax when you sell Bitcoin or use Bitcoin to buy stuff!

"Unfortunately, the article is very wrong on a lot of points. Crypto is *not* recognized as legal tender over here, coindesk pulled that out of their asses. If you buy and sell crypto, you still have to pay income tax on your gains (and capital gains taxes on top if you hold less than a year).

The only thing the ministry of finance did was to clarify that if you purchase and sell with cryptos, VAT does not apply for an imaginary conversion to fiat. The German tax code assumes this imaginary conversion if you let's say buy XMR with BTC."
"Maybe it’s not recognized as legal tender, but it sounds like it’s NOT treated as a commodity (like it is in the US/CAD); rather “money” (not currency - which would be money that is recognized as legal tender in such country). Because it’s not property, barter rules do not apply when BUYING things like coffee etc. That being said, you would still be taxed if you convert your bitcoin to fiat (as I understand). Does that sound right? If so, it’s a huge improvement over the US/CAD, where any purchase of property or goods such as coffee would trigger a taxable event (same as exchanging bitcoin for another crypto, etc.). "
Capital gain tax, not income tax... huge diferent.
I'm pretty sure Uncle Sam will demand his cut regardless. In fact afaik you would still owe US taxes even if you bought with a German back about using money earned in Germany. And if you renounce your US citizenship, you have to continue paying the IRS for several more years.
Why not? Germany has been doing good in the last 10 years. 
"> then I won't get charged for taxes because of trading?

Sadly this is a misinterpretation. The ruling regards *sales tax*. You still have to pay income tax on those ""reciprocal sales"". Also in the case of coffee.

I wish I was wrong, but I don't think so.
"
You will have to paye capital gain if the exchange rate of ETH has increased between those two trades and if there has been less than a year in between.
"No, crypto and stocks are treated differently in german tax regulation. You pay 25% flat tax (Abgeltungssteuer) on the stock gains, afaik (but I'm not sure, I don't do stocks).
"
people downvote uncomfortable truths
That's debatable, see my other posts.
And not paying capital gains?
"> The title is misleading.

The title is wrong."
"> I hope other European countries will follow suit.

German court merely followed through with the EUGh (European Court) decision on sales tax regarding crypto from 2015. Other EU countries have to follow suit, too.
"
Technically they already did because the EU ruled against VAT on crypto transactions. That part isnt really news. What's new is that Germany doesn't tax mining or staking either.
Meanwhile in the US, the people are crying that the IRS is stealing less of their money. I actually know some real people that think lowering the tax rate is bad for the people.  
"Keep in mind the long term capital gains tax rate is 0% for the majority of Americans (a slim majority but still more than 50%).

I just did my taxes this year and reported a bunch of BTC sales for 2017 and payed no tax on those sales."
It's so true.  What can be done about it.
Still the same here in germany (fuck those misguiding journalists). Up to 46% tax when you sell your coins if you held them under a year (gains from selling coins are taxed as income, income tax is progressive in germany). 0% if you held them longer than a year.
"The US government truly is an schizophrenic hypocrite of the highest order. Bitcoin apparently needs to be subject to money transmitter laws because it is a currency, but it is taxed like an asset.

It's almost like they will find any excuse to grab as much unearned wealth as they can, because who's going to stop them?"
Gvt considers inconsistencies a virtue 
"> Classifying cryptocurrencies as a good rather than a money is the biggest blunder

I agree, however:

germany classifies it as property, too. You have to pay income tax when you sell it. The ruling regards merely *sales tax*."
Most other countries already have this. Even Germany is simply following an EU ruling from three years ago.
"Ah, people who do not understand what ""legal tender"" means ..."
mind showing me the relevant part - https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapitalertragsteuer_(Deutschland) ?
"Unfortunately it does not apply to stock-trading. It used to but it doesn't anymore. Earnings up to 801€ are exempt from taxes. For anything higher you pay 25% taxes plus 1.3 % solidarity tax and if you are a member of a church 2.2 % church-tax. This also applies to 1 year +.
Usually these taxes are automatically done by your (online-) broker so you don't have to deal with it.

By the way: Europe (and now germany just released a document on it) has also very clear rules about using cryptocurrency in commerce: If it is used solely for the purpose of money, it is seen as a currency and exempt from any additional taxes. It would be the same as using fiat to buy something."
"Hmm...ok. In Denmark stock gains are taxed the following way: First 6000 € gains are taxed 27% and everything above 43%. Losses can be deducted within the same year from sales with gains within same year. 

Cryptos are taxed like assets - if you can prove it has not been speculation, you can go free from tax (how does one prove that? really?). If it is speculation, every trade is taxed seperately - kind of like in the US. Very stupid. 

Good news regarding treating crypto as currency for commerce. That is ACTUALLY a BIG relief :-) "
