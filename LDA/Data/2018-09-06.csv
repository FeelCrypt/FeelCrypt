My RES matches your observation. In nearly 30% of threads."
"You don't also post ""btrash bcrash"" so your disparagement appears totally organic. I'm referring to a special case of troll which picks up on the easy karma you can get by attacking people involved in BCH (typically CSW since he's a logical, easy target), then spends that karma attacking BCH."
Did you mean to say complicit? Lol
Found one.

You forgot to say bcash
"i don't think anyone is really as ignorant as you are, but in the off chance you've never spent 2 minutes to resaerch this. the people here are the ones who were into bitcoin 10 years ago, they are the ones who made bitcoin what it is; they are not the enemy of bitcoin."
Bitcoin Core has been attack by free speech and freedom of choice since Blockstream took over. Get over it, you're losing ground every day!
"Why not ask Theymos when his ""temporary"" ban on free speech will end"
have you honestly never bothered to look up a single fact? 
This sub was created by those who were banned and had their comments deleted by r/bitcoin mods for pointing out problems with the direction blockstream was taking bitcoin..
"This sub is the ANTIDOTE to the attack

How do you rationalize your hate
Five year account 500 karma, but now you really care about BCH politics. 
"It’s a provable fact that when you lock down the block chain and make us unusable, Bitcoins ENTIRE humanitarian and banking disruption reason for being created goes out the window.   

That is why BCH forked.  We care about those things.  You don’t.  That’s fine.  But respect why we did this.  Because we care about humanity.  "
Dude the BEST thing that can happen is a Bitcoin bull run.  It’s going to hurt so fucking bad.  
Armies of 0.2btc bagholders who think they are still in with a shot of a moon lambo
"I have seen people use “bcash” just because they had been told that it’s called that by trolls.  A lot of people who use it probably just don’t know much about Bitcoin, and they aren’t necessarily intentionally using it to be anti-BCH.

Since these people exist, I avoid calling people trolls immediately.  They could be those who just don’t know.  Plus, calling everyone a troll doesn’t look great, and it would be more useful to the ones who don’t know why “bcash” is disliked if it’s explained why.

Reply for the people reading a conversation, not just the (possible) trolls."
"Actually its called abbreviated signatures and is a user activated softfork that were incorporated a long time ago. SMS has an interesting implementation that uses abbreviated signatures to enable op_emoji.
So what happens in english is that you can only fit so many words into a sentence. Words then become expensive and you should what you can to limit their character count so you sneak more words in the sentence even though technically you shouldnt be able to. Thats called charwit but we wont go into that right now.

If you take words that show up over and over you can actually make an abbreviated hash where a sane assumption can be made on its content. So you register the short once in the first 4 bits to signify the code then the following 12 bits make up the word.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin Platinum

Bitcoin Forever

Bitcoin Gold

Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin becomes b, saving the characters and allowing more words in each sentence. 

Bitcoin

Bplatinum

Bforever

Bgold

Bcash

An interesting function that this opens is the ability to store entire sentences this way. This opens the possibility of something called Essay Processor which can instantaneously generate sentence exchanges allowing for paragraphs to instantly form with basically no way to know where the sentences came from and basically non existent cost.


EDIT - im loving the downvotes, glad so many read it. :)"
This is why I down vote anything related to CSW. I encourage others to do the same.  Let's discuss what CSW does and only after he's done it. Let's never discuss what he says.
"Even our old buddy One Meg Greg showed his neckbearded face to point out that our test bottlenecked... thanks to his code.

Heh."
"Just put your popcorn under their sad Core Troll faces 😭 

Mmmm Salty Core Tears Taste Best in Muh Popcorn 🤤😎"
I missed Greg coming back... Did he say congratulations? 
Node implementation
"Core claimed for years anything over 1mb would cause latency issues....

One thing humans fail at miserably is understanding large numbers.  Bitcoin is all about large #s"
No.  He strongly believes what he believes.  
Ooops apparently the bot has run out of gold again...
It's not useless, it raises awareness on the troll infestation problem. Newcomers don't know about that, and since this sub has chosen not to ban full-time trolls (sponsored by Blockstream and other organizations who want to kill Bitcoin), letting people know what's going on is the thing to do.
"LOL @ dissenting opinions.  Genuine concern and dissenting opinions are what *we* we’re doing when we all got banned.  Everyone here from your thought-controlled locked-down sub is here to stir shit up and cause misery.  

Because they’re afraid they’ll lose money if BCH succeeds.  "
You can use Reddit Enhancement Suite to help you remember which users are actual bitcoiners.
And you were sitting at negative 3 when I ran across this comment.   Unreal.  
Nah, I think he's a blowhard who has developed a cult of personality around himself.
Now I have to dig into you comment history and be wary of feeding you any positive karma. 
"The behavior is quite consistent. These are dedicated troll accounts who post ""btrash"" then turn around and post elsewhere using ""BCH"" when they're farming karma. Investigate the account before voting."
"The usage and offensiveness of ""bcash"" as a term is a red herring. And successfully wielded by trolls as a tool to distract from the real issues."
No. Welcome back to the sub sockpuppet.
"In a conflict, saboteurs who want to maximize damage will pretend to play both sides in the most extremist way possible. The end goal is not to damage one side, but make both CSW supporters and his detractors look insane and make reasonable people quit the damn thing in disgust. It would then not matter if one side ""wins"", the community would be in tatters anyway and be extremely difficult to recover from. 

You can probably guess whether I'm a supporter or a detractor, but even I have been noticing some strangely irrational people popping up on my ""side"", performing personal attacks on some neutral, reasonable people not known to be ""shills"". There is a list of such malicious actors compiled for suspected CSW supporters (some of them have even been found conspiring in the very slack that's been booting people from), but I do not have a list of them among detractors yet. But if the end goal is to destroy a community, it makes sense to plant extremists on both sides in addition to being one yourself.

Note that CSW himself has been explicitly [flaming](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1028350901298315264) personal attacks on less known people. Make whatever conclusion you wish."
"Those are the ones that are easy to spot even for the untrained eye. Then there are the ones that could be considered ""concern trolls"" that otherwise appear to be pro-BCH but do things like incite infighting (such as the current ""civil war"" bullshit that came out of nowhere and none of the original users on this sub took part in creating). They pretend to be on either side to create chaos and artificially increase the infighting going on in our community.

Everyone should read ""The gentleperson's guide to forum spies"" since a lot of the same tactics are being used here as well. https://bookchain.cash/read/qzzzzzy9qx93jrvh4eguejk96uexe590dyx35yxe3j (takes a little bit to load, since the text is being grabbed directly from the BCH blockchain)"
"Oh yeah I get it.  So it's like out of one corner of their mouths they pretend to be all about saving bitcoin cash, and out of the other corner they are disparaging it.  Gotcha.  Makes sense.
"
"You should edit your post a tiny bit to make that more clear.

"Wow, found an ubertroll here. Check out THIS account.

Pray, what interest is our politics to you, oh Master of Reddit?  I'm sure your involvement in our community, and your trolling comment, is totally organic isn't it.

Edit: while I found this account indicative of being a professional / team account, perhaps it's entirely ordinary, and this person just spends a lot of time on reddit.  Apologies given."
Poke him.  I heard they giggle when you poke them. 
Lol @ free of charge. Had Greg charged for the bottleneck it would have been noticed and never added.
Minimization of the trolling problem serves your goal.
"We would love to focus on content, but right now it's pretty difficult due to the troll infestation. Try posting something of value and see what happens. Instant downvotes, and instant trash replies by known trolls who just want to scare newcomers away and kill Bitcoin. Sometimes they are outright insulting, other times they pretend to be actual bitcoiners with ""concerns"", as a facade to be able to insert their anti-Bitcoin propaganda."
"You know all of this. Anyone new to the subreddit poking their heads in to lurk does not. 

The repetition is exasperating but things are *really* topsy-turvy lately."
You didn’t answer his question.

I thought purse.io actually released a BCH wallet called bcash?
"r/btc deciding who is ""attacking"" the sub https://imgflip.com/i/2hdfcv"
*The best defense is a good offense*
While you’re correct, it’s also the single most obvious sign of someone with a malicious agenda.  Unfortunately there is overlap with “regular people” purely because the trolls have been so tenacious at being shitheads all over reddit.  
Mission accomplished. Thanks Greg, now we can throw out your trash on our way forward.
What part of his code bottlenecked it?
Are you really bashing someone because your preferred crypto used his code (free of charge mind you), and it didn't perform in the unintended way you wanted it to? Maybe BCH should write their own code. It isn't Greg's job to ensure his code BCH co-opt'd works in the manner BCH wants it to.
he said there was a problem, someone said the problem was actually from code that came from greg.

I have been around for a long time
"We are of like mind.  I 100% agree.

Ah shit. When is reddit just going to accept BCH for gold directly. So simple, just a qr code. 
[deleted]
As far as I know, RES doesn't work on mobile. :-(
True, it will be interesting to watch. It’ll turn the masses to BCH. It’s sad it had to happen like this.
Lol, okay. 
I have him marked as core shill in my RES.
"> Nah, I think he's a blowhard who has developed a cult of personality around himself.

[Why not both ?](https://i.imgur.com/DBcUtoo.jpg)"
Wow if you use the ticker bch why leave out the cash part? Especially because theres no h in bitcoin. And no exchanges have bch as the ticker for bitcoin. Bch is bitcoim cash. Bitcoin is btc
🤦🏻‍♂️
"I bash CSW. I am no troll.  The man is toxic.
"
I think its only a matter of time before pro-CSW crowd splits off into a different subreddit. 
This sub, much like BCH, is a joke. Most of you who believe in this conspiracy theory nonsense probably think Blockstream is part of the Deep State and QAnon will save us from the satanic baby-eaters, too.
It’s because bcash is not BTC
This is what people predicted a successful stress test would result in - a last campaign to save the Core (soft) fork. It's clear there's very heavy trolling activity because this is one of the most active subs while its posts never get upvoted to the front page!
Lol at the Bitcoin core fucks hoping for a bull run on a non scaled bitcoin. The average person won’t be able to afford those fees.
"I'll add a personal observation.

I have noticed a common behavior shared among many trolls.

Out of one side of their mouths they bash CSW. This gets them positive karma because hating that guy is pretty popular right now.

Out of the other side of their mouths they bash BCH ""bcash btrash bcrash""

Next time you see *either* of these kinds of posts on an unknown account, check the post history. If you discover this behavior, be wary of feeding these trolls positive karma, *even if* you agree with *some* of what they say.

**Nobody** that uses the term ""bcash"" in this sub has Bitcoin's (BCH) best interests at heart. They're just posting things that not only divide us, but which also get karma.

Edit: to clarify, they appear to support BCH by attacking individuals in BCH, ""for the good of the community."" Then they spend that karma elsewhere attacking BCH outright."
[There is heavy vote manipulation](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8umt8i/psa_remember_to_check_the_new_tab_on_this_sub_so/) as well as targeted trolling going on.  Sometimes I have noticed downvote attacks immediately after a thread is introduced.  Then weirdly there is crazy amount of upvotes sometimes as well, but these upvotes are so fake that the thread won't even go to the front page.  Then it is slowly downvoted and nobody ever sees the thread.  Possibly this is some sort of gaming of reddit's algorithm.  Very suspicious.  Well when you are getting flack it means you are over the target.
Everytime I come here I look for your posts, your one of the only users here I trust.
"> Nobody attacks what isn't dangerous.  

exactly. People fight to control what is valuable or to attack what is working better."
[deleted]
Yeah I've noticed this a lot also, my vote counts on recent posts here shooting up then crashing down again...
You do realize that just because someone disagrees with you it does not make them a troll, right? 
Members of the Cult of Core are spreading their salty tears everywhere. Beware where you put your feet, it's slippery! 
The simple math proves that 8MB blocks are trivial for anyone with a modern hard drive and reasonably fast internet.  (Sorry Australia)
Yep.  The stress test with 2.2 million transactions in 24 hours has vindicated on chain scaling.  This brought even Greg Maxwell back to the sub.  :)  So you know the trolls are busy.  Plus the sub is getting increased organic traffic from users who are questioning the Blockstream narrative.  Where is their peer to peer cash?  Why does BTC need all the special doohickeys and thingamabobs, when Bitcoin Cash can do 2.2 million transactions in a day with fees about $ 0.001?  Now the narrative controllers are here working overtime LOL.

"My post on Craig which was actually a call to not be so petty on social media (as he already is for us) and instead try to critique him better was initially heavily downvoted. 

While I'm obviously not pleased by this, perhaps worse was to see the sudden influx of clear bot upvotes (20 something) after half an hour or so of nothing. It would appear they blindly vote on Craig related posts after a set time."
When you are taking flak it means you are over the target. 
The elite will see the world burn before they lose control.
"Serious question: Do you think CSW is some sort of government agitator/double agent?
"
">Nobody attacks what isn't dangerous.

This isn't true at all. Bullies will often attack others who can't or won't fight back. And they do it because they think they can get away with it, not because they think the person or thing they are attacking is dangerous. Core trolls are coming out of the woodwork because they see the vulnerable position Bitcoin Cash is in with its current political divide.

We all need to realize that Bitcoin Cash is not in a position to split apart."
Reddit is broken, unfortunately.
"bwaaa bwaaa they attack uuuss cry more.

Remember guys if it doesn't toe the company line its a vicious attack.
He’s compliant in the trolling efforts.
"LOL this is rich - this entire sub is a community of trolls that harass a legitimate community. 

&#x200B;

It's Bitcoin that is under attack by you and the other Keynesians around here."
Yes, that's why we have a sticky at the top. The attacks have heightened in the past couple of weeks. 
The trolls always get upvoted highly now too. In the past they'd be in the negatives.
"It seems the ideal atmosphere for a crypto community is the permanent state of crisis, panic and paranoia. 

Or, said differently: those who aren't into this may one day ask themselves why not buy 1,000 oz of silver and read books instead of wasting time on this shit."
