This is more than segwit, dude. Look at what happened with censorship and XT. There has been big blockers discussions since 2014.
"Wow, wtf is this? Fan of the old nazi tactics are we? 
Did you work for the stasi by any chance? 
Creepy dude right here."
"The code was completely finished at this point this was written:
https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/

In it they say the reason to avoid hard forking is to prevent user confusion and loss of value/integrity of the brand.  Ironically, we ended up forking BCH off anyway (fail?).  What you are suggesting doesn't make sense to me, there was not a threat of big blockers forking off at the point the segwit development was finished.  Big blockers forked off -much later- but they always could have, nothing prevents that at any time... In fact 'fork off' was a common message to big blockers during the final segwit adoption."
I call it bitcoin cash or bcash because it’s not bitcoin, it’s bitcoin cash. 
"Seems to me that BCH is trying to make it confusing, and hoping their new narrative spreads. 

The fact they want to take over the Bitcoin name, instead of just succeeding on their merits, turns me off. "
Lolololol I have low karma in this bcash echo chamber. Ohhhhh well

This is not about Buffetts interests. If Buffett thought that bitcoin was a better investment then Wells Fargo he would just simply sell Wells Fargo and buy bitcoin. Buffett's loyality is in things that promise good and safe return, not on speculative investments, and his stand on this has been the same since like 1964. I own a good chunk of bitcoin in my portfolio but please be rational instead of finding every excuse to fit your worldview.
Good thing I’m into the whole HODL thing then
Ever heard of 0-conf?
Just yesterday I purchased breakfast at the Brisbane Airport with bitcoin cash - the store was happy to give it to me instantly. 0 conf works, and the risk is with the merchant, not with the happy customer!
Exactly. He’s the master of long term investing and market wisdom. He doesn’t have a damn clue what the next big thing will Be because he’s technologically illiterate and refuses to buy into something he doesn’t fully understand. He’ll miss the blockchain revolution, he’ll miss AI, IoT, robotics, and whatever business Elon Musk is in because he’s too stubborn
"He doesn't 'own' Goldman. Goldman's market cap is about 93 billion according to Bloomberg: [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US)

So he owns about 2.69&#37; of Goldman. Now don't get me wrong, that's a lot of Goldman for a single shareholder but that doesn't mean he owns it at all."
Because he's old and lame now, and you can't convince smn like him if he doesn't believe smth himself, somebody should tell him: the future is now old man!
"It's called ""talking your book"" and the old man is a master at it.

what a friendly, believable grandpa character he is..."
I'd say it's 60/40 with the 60 being staying away from tech stocks and 40 being self serving interest.
He has tens of millions in Apple. Only reason he has so much Wells Fargo is because he bought up a bunch of shares during the crash in 2008 when they were trading at like $7. 
"He has stated many times throughout his career that technology companies are inherently the riskiest, and that's why he stays away. He's a pure fundamentalist, and most new technology companies have way too high a PE to justify him investing. It's a fact that with every new technology, 99&#37; of the companies that try to lead the way fail.

His first speech and analysis on the subject are here. His insights on horse, automobile, and airplane technologies as they were emerging is quite amazing. He gave the speech to a room full of dot com investors \(including Bill Gates\) and many of them saw him as an uneducated old fool. One year later the dot com bubble collapsed. While many of those investors lost everything, he literally became a millions richer: [http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune\_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm)"
True that selling all at once would crash the price. Which is why he has no incentive to sell so foolishly. Big investors sell slowly, bit by bit and change positions over several quarters. He could easily do that if he thought it was warranted.
"well, he sold his (or actually BH) holdings in IMB worth of 10B (at a loss) without tanking the market. the whole crypto market would've gone to zero if anything like that is done.  
so actually the correct statement is:  
*he can't buy btc even if he sees the potential in bitcoin, cause crypto market isnt liquid enough*"
"Bitcoin was invented to make banks obsolete. The banks ""make money"" by literally printing it out of thin air and lending through fractional reserve. Bitcoin is about sound deflationary money - the opposite of how banks work, so yes, banks and crypto are mutually incompatible (except for shitcoins with no supply cap)."
he's owned banks for 50+ years, so its the former. 
Lol
"[OVERVIEW: Warren Buffett has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth to philanthropic causes. Approximately 83% of that will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and much of the rest will be distributed to the foundations of his children.

He also constantly advocates that the rich should be taxed more."
you can see holdings here https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/berkshire-hathaway-inc-54239
Those are tools for spreading autism and cancer towards population control. 
"If he thought crypto was a great idea, he could slowly and quietly sell holdings in other areas and get even richer if/when crypto moons.

If he believed it would make him richer, sustainably over long periods of time, he'd probably just do it.

It's fine to argue that he's wrong. But guy kinda does whatever the f he wants with his money. And he wants to invest in things he understands."
History has shown long term value investors win over every other strategy.
"> Big if huge!

What?"
Probably because they put it in a difficult format that yahoo couldn't parse it into a usable form.
"Advocating that people get taxed more is way more evil than making lots of money.

In fact, making money isn't necessarily evil. You can do so by doing good.

Taxes on the other hand, are everywhere and always an evil. Whether or not they are a *necessary* evil is what's up for some debate."
"Well this has surprised me. I’m glad he has this intentions. I heard about the worlds richest lady dying last year. And how much money she died with. Insane wealth. So much good can be done with that money, and it’s simply kept in a bank to feed ego. 

Even Buffett could be doing so much good now, why wait until death. "
"> He also constantly advocates that the rich should be taxed more.

Is it good? Everybody should be taxed LESS, and banks should pay most of the bill for obvious reasons."
That sounds like a pretty okay agenda.

why would bitcoin cash be used as a currency?  the confirmation time takes 10 minutes for a single confirmation, that is way to slow to use as a regular currency in daily transactions for anything smaller than several thousand dollars worth of value.  Nobody is going to want to wait 10 minutes to buy a bag of groceries at checkout.
I don't think that you know how taxes work.
HODLing is not investing. It's savings crossed with speculation. Investing is an entirely different concept. It involves putting capital into things that pay a yield.
True. But he'll also still be rich when Elon Musk (or at least Tesla) inevitably goes bankrupt.
He'll probably miss it because he'll be dead.
Does he own a share? He owns Goldman. Nobody owns a public company, they can have a majority stake - which I didn’t say buffet did.

"Buffet's attitude towards bitcoin is almost certainly because he doesn't understand it. The guy is immensely brilliant at what he does but you are talking about someone who doesn't even use a computer and who avoided all tech companies until his recent investment in Apple.

His strategy has always been to invest in things he fully understands, and if there is any doubt, avoid.

Again. Buffet is brilliant. But asking him about bitcoin is like asking the world's best chef about oil mining.

To be honest it didnt take much brains to make money when he did.  
Or maybe you're just using this as confirmation bias

Anyone that wants to get rid of your “monopoly” money, I’ll take it!  
Talk about vested interest - he has some
I don't think so.  He's been wrong a bunch in tech stocks (and is slow to include them after they do well), overall staying away from technology, I'd say this explains his attitude towards Bitcoin better than shilling for how banks.
He said this initially then a few months later came out against it as fundamentally flawed, hackers and so on. The major cryptos started to go through a collapse about a week after he was on the news saying these things. 
Selling that kind off money will crash the whole system, he can't do that even if he sees the potential in bitcoin
Exactly and cryptocurrency and banks are not contradictory concepts. Banks make money from giving out loans, savings and checking accounts are not how they make money. Loans are still going to exist in a cryptocurrency world

">there is also nothing stopping BCH \+ second layer solutions like LN

Even if BCC HF in a solution for transaction malleability they have three problems using and adopting LN scaling solutions

1\) The whole ethos of bcash is to always have low onchain tx fees regardless of other scaling solutions and to keep HF blocksize increases to insure this happens therefore there will never be any motivation to do the hardwork of building LN on BCC

2\) Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like segwit , RBF and the codebase keeps diverging between BTC and BCC it will become increasingly more difficult to copy the work from LN implementations without creating bugs

3\) One key aspect of LN securely is users being able to run their own full nodes or watch towers which will become very hard to do if Bcash keeps increasing their blocksize limit"

"You see right there you exposed the myth of centralisation really well. Also your lack of understanding of Bitcoin.

People saying ""only miners matter"" are not talking about miner opinions. They are talking about nodes. Only mining nodes make the network decentralised. Non-mining nodes are irrelevant in judging the centralisation of the network.

""Terabyte block initiative"" is just hyperbole. 8MB and 32 MB are not terabyte blocks. He'll as it is 1GB blocks have been tested, and they could work to give around ten thousand transactions per second with a moderate gaming computer. So even then centralisation couldn't be an issue. We are a long way from needing blocks that big though and by then it wouldn't be considered large.

As for Satosshi's vision, well yes. He didn't think miners and other node operators would be small computers. It was always meant to scale up. Once established that we'll it wouldn't matter though. Everyone's phone is not meant to be a node, and no that doesn't mean it is not P2P."

And I have. I paid $30 to get in the next block. With BCH I am guaranteed to get in the next block with the current growth for a few years at least.

segwit2x didn't activate segwit but BIP 91 did. BIP 91 has nothing to do with segwit2x
Indeed.
Not everyone is interested in day trading and speculation. It shouldn't concern you what another person does with their money.
"ELI5\- 

1\) The whitepaper assumed that Bitcoin might scale with SPV nodes\(light clients that don't validate all the consensus rules\) with something called Fraud alerts or fraud proofs . These have never existed and may never properly exist , thus reinforcing the importance of validating your own txs with a full node as trusting a third part is not using p2p cash by definition and is less secure 

2\)  Many Bcash supporters care less about security , de\-emphasize the importance of full nodes , and promote the idea that we should just trust the miners to do the right thing instead of having economic users validate the txs and keep the miners in check. 

3\) The article I linked makes the assumption that Bitcoin or Bcash scaling in a far more centralized and less secure way as a hypothetical and does the math to see if it could scale with almost all users using light clients 

4\) The math shows it cannot scale with this assumption due to the demand on the servers serving SPV clients 

Thus BCH is a technical dead end and Bitcoin's plans to scale in many ways with  Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains intelligently may work"
"> The community was quite vocally against segwit2x

No, I say: vocal presence on main communication channels and on social media. What economical weight that ""community"" had remains unknown, but I guess it's a very small weight"

"All good points, but I think the censorship was used to block the growing support for the more practical solutions. 

The BS baffles brains was at least in part fueled by censorship. 

I think part of the problem is those invested in bitcoin have seen amazing returns, they intern think that someone has made this posable, and look to the developers who have written the code that stores the value.

I think the point of the BCH community is not ""big bigger biggest is the answer"" it's a roadmap that accepts innovation and ideas freely, with larger blocks being just one of those accepted ideas, and is also a short term answer. "
If it is truly unbounded, we would have full blocks right now. The entire history of bitcoin until January of last year is proof you are wrong

>Anyway, he wanted to use BCH at first. His project however was the prime example for how there is unbounded demand for virtually free transactions.

If we lived in some bizarro universe where your friend’s idea weren’t completely shitty and was instead wildly successful with millions of people every day making separate on-chain transactions for the privilege of purchasing individual M&M’s from a vending machine then yeah, that might support the case that there is almost “unbounded demand for virtually-free transactions.” But that’s not this universe. In this universe, it took Bitcoin approximately 8 years just to begin filling up itty-bitty 1-MB blocks despite the fact that its transactions were, for the vast majority of that time, “virtually-free.” And in this universe Bitcoin Cash has enjoyed “virtually free” transactions for the nine months since the split and its blocks are on average still less than 100kb."

Not really. XT was going to win. It had massive support.

BTC is already bottlenecked and LN is still far away from being ready for game time. To bet on BTC/LN is like saying: ""Let's wait a few years, then maybe we'll race for users and merchants"". If you want that bet, then you should avoid publicity because uptake causes congestion causes heartburn for all involved.

BCH is certainly on a race for mindshare, the difference is that they can absorb the uptake in merchants and users, it's ready for the uptake now instead of 2020

Segwit2X failure was the proof everyone needed that Bitcoin has been taken over....everyone had agreed on that fork, what a governance gongshow.

How exactly will LN improve security, or quicker confirmations or true p2p cash? It is a complex topic, and everyone everywhere (except geeks) will end up setting up a single channel with Amazon with all of their bitcoins in the channel. It is so blindly obvious that that will happen. 

So my wife will run her own watchtower? And somehow we need to explain this to people?

When Bitcoin's biggest deterrent is still usability, merchant adoption and uptake - these brilliant minds decided ""let's make it more difficult, screw the merchants who already adopted us, pause uptake for 5 years, and make it harder for everyone to understand"". Again governance gongshow

2) You are completely missing the point.

"> Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mb. 

What?

The upgrade is to 32MB block LIMIT. It's not that the blocks will be 32MB in size right after upgrade. You really need to understand why the LIMIT is there in the first place. 

Clue - it is not to limit the tx capacity.

This upgrade is to show the users the path BCH is going  - on-chain scalling. Yes, 1GB blocks were already tested. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ax5ih/scaling_bitcoin_stanford_20171104_peter_rizun/"
"BCH can and will implement other features that will help fit more transactions per MB before it hits 1GB. Things like schnorr signatures, time locked transactions that could bundle many small transactions to an address; think satoshi dice using 0\-conf time locked so all transactions made to an address will be posted as one transaction after x blocks."
