I’m up almost 80k this week from holding BTC, so I decided to give some away to my supporte…[New Post] Bitcoin is becoming much more important in Hong Kong and India. 

It won't happen overnight, but slowly people are reminded why they should own a decentralized digital currency.

https://t.co/lJHMyeeJKeBitcoin is different things to different people.

When you’re worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin’s non-seizability becomes very attractive.

This aspect of Bitcoin just became important for 1+ billion people in India &amp; Hong Kong. https://t.co/nLLaUlRpBzGeneral Electric has frozen pension payments for 20,000 employees.

The pension problem in America is only going to get worse over time.

Promises will be broken.

Every pension needs to have exposure to Bitcoin.

It won't happen overnight, but slowly people are reminded why they should own a decentralized digital currency.

https://t.co/lJHMyeeJKeBitcoin is different things to different people.

When you’re worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin’s non-seizability becomes very attractive.

This aspect of Bitcoin just became important for 1+ billion people in India &amp; Hong Kong. https://t.co/nLLaUlRpBzGeneral Electric has frozen pension payments for 20,000 employees.

The pension problem in America is only going to get worse over time.

Promises will be broken.

Every pension needs to have exposure to Bitcoin.

I’m up almost 80k this week from holding BTC, so I decided to give some away to my supporte…[New Post] Bitcoin is becoming much more important in Hong Kong and India. 

It won't happen overnight, but slowly people are reminded why they should own a decentralized digital currency.

https://t.co/lJHMyeeJKeBitcoin is different things to different people.

When you’re worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin’s non-seizability becomes very attractive.

This aspect of Bitcoin just became important for 1+ billion people in India &amp; Hong Kong. https://t.co/nLLaUlRpBzGeneral Electric has frozen pension payments for 20,000 employees.

The pension problem in America is only going to get worse over time.

Promises will be broken.

Every pension needs to have exposure to Bitcoin.

They must #GetOffZero 🙏🏽RT @markethive: Twitter isn’t tired of Bitcoin even though hashtags are at an all-time ...

It won't happen overnight, but slowly people are reminded why they should own a decentralized digital currency.

https://t.co/lJHMyeeJKeBitcoin is different things to different people.

When you’re worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin’s non-seizability becomes very attractive.

This aspect of Bitcoin just became important for 1+ billion people in India &amp; Hong Kong. https://t.co/nLLaUlRpBzGeneral Electric has frozen pension payments for 20,000 employees.

The pension problem in America is only going to get worse over time.

I’m up almost 80k this week from holding BTC, so I decided to give some away to my supporte…[New Post] Bitcoin is becoming much more important in Hong Kong and India. 

It won't happen overnight, but slowly people are reminded why they should own a decentralized digital currency.

https://t.co/lJHMyeeJKeBitcoin is different things to different people.

When you’re worried about your assets being seized or becoming inaccessible to you, Bitcoin’s non-seizability becomes very attractive.

This aspect of Bitcoin just became important for 1+ billion people in India &amp; Hong Kong. https://t.co/nLLaUlRpBzGeneral Electric has frozen pension payments for 20,000 employees.

The pension problem in America is only going to get worse over time.

Promises will be broken.

Every pension needs to have exposure to Bitcoin.
